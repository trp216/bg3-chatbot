Astarion,Let's get you up.
Astarion,"But if I finish the ritual you started, I'll never have to fear anyone, ever."
Astarion,I am so much more than what you made me.
Astarion,I need your eyes. In a manner of speaking.
Astarion,"Use the parasite - link your mind to mine. Through your eyes, I can see the scars on my back and copy them onto his."
Astarion,"Yes. Yes, I see it!"
Astarion,There. Perfect.
Astarion,Time to take your place.
Astarion,Ecce dominus!
Astarion,Has animas offero in sacrificio...
Astarion,Nunc volo potestatem quam pollicitus es mihi...
Astarion,"I... I can't feel it. That ache in my stomach, that hunger - it's gone."
Astarion,"Come on, let's get out of here. I have a brand new world to explore."
Astarion,[Panting]
Astarion,"Yes, it's over. You can do whatever you want."
Astarion,"As for those wretches in the cells - if I don't get my freedom, neither do they."
Astarion,It's over. I'm done with this and I'm done with you.
Astarion,"I would say good luck out there, but honestly? I hope you die screaming."
Astarion,One last thrust and I'll be free of you. I'll never have to fear you again.
Astarion,I'm not the one in the dirt.
Astarion,Doors can be unsealed. Do you have the key?
Astarion,"Things have changed, Godey. We might surprise you."
Astarion,I don't even know what this prison is. He hid all of this from me and the others.
Astarion,"If I had to guess, I'd say they're part of his ritual. But where in the hells did they come from?"
Astarion,I'm just surprised to see such wretched-looking specimens - Cazador had a more refined palate than this.
Astarion,It's taking everything I have not to grind your rotten carcass to dust.
Astarion,You tortured us. For days at a time.
Astarion,"We're here to see the master, but the ballroom door's locked. Give us the key."
Astarion,I was hoping you'd say that. Taking it from the ruins of your corpse will be more satisfying anyway.
Astarion,Isn't it obvious? I'm going to kill Cazador.
Astarion,"You might have made me what I am, but I can be so much more than what you created me to be."
Astarion,I've come home to rejoin the family.
Astarion,But master called me home! I have to get to him!
Astarion,The ballroom door's locked and I need the key.
Astarion,I'm looking for Cazador. Where is he?
Astarion,How about I start breaking bones and keep going until I find that key?
Astarion,"I do want to hurt you, if that's what you mean."
Astarion,Isn't it obvious? I'm here to kill Cazador.
Astarion,"I know you're there, Godey. Stop skulking and show yourself."
Astarion,Doors can be unsealed. Just give us the key and we'll show ourselves in.
Astarion,He needs me to complete the ritual. He'll be furious if you stop me from joining him.
Astarion,I have no idea what these wretches are doing here. 'The Master' had a more refined palate than this.
Astarion,But I am grateful for one thing. You showed me how to really savour moments like this.
Astarion,It means you have a choice. 
Astarion,I... I think we're done here.
Astarion,Let's hope for gold.
Astarion,Let's go.
Astarion,Don't mind me. I'm just enjoying the show.
Astarion,You're right.
Astarion,"I am done picking up after Cazador. I wash my hands of all of this. This place, this ritual, these people."
Astarion,"You can stay if you want, but I have a life and I intend to live it."
Astarion,Come on. Let's go.
Astarion,"Your choices are simple, really."
Astarion,It will become everyone's business if you try to feast on half the city. This is just a friendly warning.
Astarion,"And I want to live a full life! Not some half existence, hiding in the shadows for the rest of eternity."
Astarion,"I'm not him, and I will not become him."
Astarion,Please! I can't do this alone.
Astarion,Unmaking what you made me.
Astarion,Help me do this. Please.
Astarion,I can feel it! I CAN FEEL THEIR POWER FLOWING INTO ME!
Astarion,"Now we deal with the elder brain. I no longer require its parasite, so we can end this once and for all."
Astarion,What's in here?
Astarion,"I don't like it, but you're right. Putting them to rest may be the kindest thing we can do."
Astarion,"Follow the tunnels to the Underdark. You'll be... well, not 'safe' there, but in less peril. "
Astarion,A quick rummage.
Astarion,"You can hide here, living in the shadows like parasites, or you can be more than what he made us to be."
Astarion,The poor wretches in the cells are innocent. They shouldn't have to suffer just because I lured them here.
Astarion,"They'll need someone to lead them. Take the tunnels into the Underdark, find somewhere... well, not safe, but less perilous?"
Astarion,Just try to keep them out of trouble.
Astarion,It's over. It's finally over.
Astarion,"No, no. No healing sleep for you. Wake up!"
Astarion,What are you waiting for? Help me!
Astarion,"I can do this, but I need your help."
Astarion,Yes. He's gone.
Astarion,"These people died years ago, trust me on that. All that's left are feral spawn, desperate for blood."
Astarion,"But if they die and I ascend, I won't have to rely on the parasite to walk in the sun. I'll be free - truly, completely free. Isn't that what you want?"
Astarion,You - you're right. I can be better than him.
Astarion,But I'm not above enjoying this.
Astarion,"'You can do whatever you want' sounds terrifying - and it is - but there's opportunity in it, too."
Astarion,"You can choose differently, of course, but the consequences are on your head."
Astarion,"Now that's a better question. Seven thousand spawn, from ancient conquests to stolen children..."
Astarion,"We're not like those wretches, brother. We've spent lifetimes controlling our hunger - they're all but feral."
Astarion,"I don't relish it any more than you do, but putting them to rest may be the kindest thing we can do."
Astarion,"If we release them, how many people will they kill? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands?"
Astarion,"Hardly. Cazador didn't keep me in luxury, but I've never seen anything like this."
Astarion,I know so many of these faces.
Astarion,You don't understand - it's not just him.
Astarion,"Funny, but unbecoming."
Astarion,I hope you're not here to beg. It's so unbecoming. 
Astarion,"Still, I would've liked more for my trouble than a pat on the head and vinegar for wine."
Astarion,True. That was fun.
Astarion,"Enjoy myself? There's a worm in my brain, I'm surrounded by idiots, and all I've got to drink is wine that tastes like vinegar."
Astarion,That means I have to survive tonight. And this party.
Astarion,"Enjoy myself? There's a worm in my brain, hunters on my trail, and all I've got to drink is wine that tastes like vinegar."
Astarion,All I want is a little fun. Is that so much to ask?
Astarion,See what I mean? Awful.
Astarion,"That's a 'no' to fun, then?"
Astarion,Cheeky. I'll see you then.
Astarion,Will you now? Don't take too long. You're not the only tasty morsel here.
Astarion,Fine. Enjoy your night with whatever beast will have you.
Astarion,I remember you.
Astarion,How are you still alive?
Astarion,That scar on your face - it must bind you to Cazador's Black Mass.
Astarion,That scar on your face - what does it mean?
Astarion,"You're eager, aren't you? But we need to wait a little longer."
Astarion,"Once everyone's in their bedrolls, we'll slip out of ours and find each other."
Astarion,Do you mind? I'm very busy.
Astarion,"Are you now? Well, lucky him."
Astarion,I don't know. I'm sure a vampire spawn could still rip your throat out if he felt like it.
Astarion,We've all survived so far. Let's focus on that.
Astarion,Indeed it is. We should do something about this threat.
Astarion,"These days, I'm making the impossible look easy."
Astarion,May I?
Astarion,Wait - that's it? We're just walking away?
Astarion,Don't you think we should do something about the... vampire issue?
Astarion,"Fine. But if this comes back to bite us, it's on your head."
Astarion,Sebastian.
Astarion,They'd better bloody not.
Astarion,You idiot. What have you done?
Astarion,You treacherous little worm!
Astarion,"Something terrifying, no doubt. Dragon? Cyclops? Kobold?"
Astarion,What in the Hells are you planning to do?
Astarion,This is nicely barbaric and vulgar.<br>
Astarion,"If you're looking for another shot, I'm afraid you've missed it."
Astarion,Having fun yet?
Astarion,Thank you so much for telling me. Now please do piss off.
Astarion,Excellent.
Astarion,The scar on your face - it must bind you to Cazador's Black Mass. I need to kill him.
Astarion,I'm here to stop the Black Mass - to kill Cazador.
Astarion,You should be dead. Why didn't Cazador feed on you?
Astarion,"They could be sacrifices for the Black Mass, but where did he get them all?"
Astarion,But who knows? Maybe the old man's tastes've changed since I left.
Astarion,You - no. You're dead.
Astarion,You were handsome. Shy. You'd never been kissed.
Astarion,It can't be -
Astarion,So Cazador marked them too - bound us all to his ritual.
Astarion,"Gods, I know so many of these faces."
Astarion,Then they're bound to the Black Mass too. Bound through the scars. And through me.
Astarion,How did they get here? What is Cazador doing with them? My brethren spoke nothing of this...
Astarion,I know these faces - every one that shares my scar.
Astarion,"They're my conquests. I pursued them, seduced them, then brought them to Cazador. He told us he was feeding on them. "
Astarion,But he turned them to spawn. He turned every last one so he'd have souls for this cursed ritual.
Astarion,One hundred and seventy years. You were one of my first.
Astarion,That's why we're here - to destroy Cazador.
Astarion,"I promise you, I know that feeling all too well. But it can be done."
Astarion,Trust me when I say I know the feeling. But you can resist the urge.
Astarion,We'll be back. You have my word.
Astarion,Don't. Not now.
Astarion,It's not just him - I know so many of these faces.
Astarion,I think the answer to that is 'whatever they damn well please'.
Astarion,How did they get here? What is Cazador doing with them? I should have guessed there was more to it than Raphael would ever have told.
Astarion,"I can put this right, I swear. I can kill Cazador and free us all."
Astarion,I'm so sorry.
Astarion,One hundred and seventy years. You were one of my first too.
Astarion,"I can fix this. When I kill Cazador, you'll be free."
Astarion,I've done the impossible before.
Astarion,"Tell me where he is, and I swear I'll end him."
Astarion,"When he's dead, you'll be mine to command."
Astarion,I truly wanted you - Cazador forced me to harm you. I'll kill him.
Astarion,"Well, at least you only had the best."
Astarion,Oh they're disgusting. Cazador never fed on wretches like this.
Astarion,There were so many of you - I can't remember them all.
Astarion,Read his thoughts.
Astarion,Try to remember his name.
Astarion,You're mistaken. I have no idea who you are.
Astarion,Who are these wretches?
Astarion,I... I recognise that voice. You were in the Blushing Mermaid.
Astarion,That scar - Cazador did that to you? He bound you to the Black Mass?
Astarion,That scar - Cazador did that to you? What does it mean?
Astarion,"I can put this right, I swear. I'm here to stop the Black Mass - to kill Cazador."
Astarion,I don't remember. I'm sorry.
Astarion,"Oh don't worry, darling. I won't bite unless you ask very, very nicely."
Astarion,What are you doing? No - stop!
Astarion,It's - it's gone. All that power.
Astarion,"It's easy for some, of course. You and Wyll seem to be getting on very well."
Astarion,I wonder if he uses magic in the bedroom? That could go very well or very badly.
Astarion,"It's easy for some, of course. You and Gale seem to be getting on very well."
Astarion,"Not what I'd call 'passionate', or 'interesting', but sweet."
Astarion,It's easy for some. You and Shadowheart seem to have a connection. It looks very sweet.
Astarion,"Ha! No, I've seen enough blades in my time."
Astarion,Ha! No. If he had an incubus instead of that cambion? That might be a different story.
Astarion,"Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the tiefling."
Astarion,"Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the walking encyclopaedia."
Astarion,"Ha! No, my love, you and Shadowheart can get up to whatever you want. It means nothing to me."
Astarion,"Serious or not, it's something."
Astarion,I'm sure it'll be adequate.
Astarion,It's easy for some. I see Lae'zel's marked you as her territory.
Astarion,I'm just looking for a little more excitement. A little more fun.
Astarion,Forgiveness? You've never forgiven anything.
Astarion,"Every mistake, every slip was punished!"
Astarion,"No! No, fuck you and fuck everything you've ever done to me."
Astarion,Are you looking forward to seeing his 'Blade of Frontiers'? I hope it's more greatsword than dagger.
Astarion,"It's easy for some, of course. You and Karlach seem to be getting on very well."
Astarion,"It's none of my business, of course. I wouldn't want to intrude."
Astarion,Bravo! I didn't think you had it in you.
Astarion,Do you think Wyll would approve? I saw how he looked at you earlier.
Astarion,Do you think Karlach would approve? I saw how she looked at you earlier.
Astarion,Do you think Gale would approve? I saw how he looked at you earlier.
Astarion,Do you think Shadowheart would approve? I saw how she looked at you earlier.
Astarion,Do you think Lae'zel would approve? I saw how she looked at you earlier.
Astarion,"Not at all! I was hoping for companionship and - well, maybe a little death. Figuratively speaking."
Astarion,"Nothing so dramatic. Just you and me and - well, maybe a little death? Figuratively speaking."
Astarion,"Anyway, don't let me keep you. I'm sure you have someone else to sniff around. "
Astarion,You son of a bitch!
Astarion,"I mean, can you imagine? Urgh. No."
Astarion,"Watch, maybe, but never intrude."
Astarion,"Not least of whom is our friend, the new Grand Duke."
Astarion,Let's be quick.
Astarion,Crack it open.
Astarion,Make it quick.
Astarion,"We will need to be careful, of course. There are still powerful forces in the city."
Astarion,"Oh, darling. I love the way you think."
Astarion,Just be grateful that my ears can't bleed.
Astarion,"Not with you, just to be clear."
Astarion,Urgh... argh...
Astarion,"That's what you think, you son of a bitch!"
Astarion,No! Stop him! And get me out of this!
Astarion,"I'll be here, waiting for the sunrise."
Astarion,"By all means, go and enjoy yourself."
Astarion,But what do I get for all my hard work? A pat on the head and vinegar for wine.
Astarion,We killed some goblins to save some tieflings. The tally of lives didn't change much.
Astarion,I hate it. This is awful.
Astarion,Never thought I'd be the one they toast for saving so many lives. And now that I'm here...
Astarion,"You know, I never pictured myself as a hero."
Astarion,"So I can see from all your heavily-armed friends. You didn't think I could resist completing the ritual, did you?"
Astarion,I am here to take my rightful place. I'm going to ascend.
Astarion,Thank you. And for what it's worth - I'm sorry. I wish I could return the ones I took from you.
Astarion,"Cazador may be gone, but there are still thousands of vampire spawn down there."
Astarion,While they're distracted.
Astarion,"My darling, of course! I want nothing more."
Astarion,"Just full of surprises, aren't you?"
Astarion,"Cazador may be gone, but there are still thousands of vampire spawn down there. Including your children."
Astarion,Really? I'm hurt.
Astarion,Out of my way. I'm in no mood to talk.
Astarion,They were innocents. To kill them would have been an even greater crime.
Astarion,"Oh please, there's no need for such language. I promised you Cazador's death and I more than delivered."
Astarion,"No, I wouldn't want to get in the middle of whatever that is. We'll end tonight as friends."
Astarion,Soon you'll be begging for your life.
Astarion,I'm an angel of vengeance. That's what you made me.
Astarion,I don't need anyone to speak for me.
Astarion,"But until the moment's right, we can still be together. We can still taste all the delights of this world."
Astarion,Picking under pressure.
Astarion,Not the best timing.
Astarion,No! Shut up!
Astarion,I don't owe you a damn thing.
Astarion,I'm here to stop you and this cursed ritual.
Astarion,What is this? Why are the others in chains?
Astarion,"We're finishing this ritual. But I'm taking the power, not you."
Astarion,I've soared without you. I've walked in the sunlight.
Astarion,No. I'm not some goat to sacrifice in your ritual.
Astarion,What is this? What are you doing to them?
Astarion,It's time for you to die.
Astarion,"Resist his blood magic. Without allies, it's all over if he takes control of you."
Astarion,Force your body to resist - don't let him control you.
Astarion,"Give in, let him control you."
Astarion,And if I do join them?
Astarion,You can't kill all these people. I won't let you.
Astarion,I've been free of your rules. I've tasted the blood of thinking creatures.
Astarion,"Oh? And bring him where, exactly?"
Astarion,"Well, that'd certainly spice up this evening."
Astarion,"All right, but don't take too long. You're not the only tasty morsel around here."
Astarion,"True, he has a lot of power at his fingertips. He could be a threat."
Astarion,"True, she could be a threat."
Astarion,My love. You always know the right thing to say.
Astarion,I wonder...
Astarion,"Perhaps we'll even meet again someday. The future is yet to be written, after all."
Astarion,As for you... I wish you well. I'm sure you'll land on your feet.
Astarion,Stab him.
Astarion,You saved me to create a pawn you could use! I should kill you for that alone.
Astarion,Don't mind if I do.
Astarion,I'll just help myself.
Astarion,I don't need you - I don't need anyone. I already have everything I want.
Astarion,"You stupid, ungrateful, little- Fine. Fine! To hells with you, I'll take Baldur's Gate myself."
Astarion,Seems it won't take 'no' for an answer.
Astarion,"Well well, it likes you. Whatever the hells it is."
Astarion,Excuse me? You want to leave - now? At my moment of triumph? Have you lost your mind?!
Astarion,"How lucky you are that I chose you as my consort. Chose you to help me take Baldur's Gate, then sit by my side as I rule it."
Astarion,"Yes, please."
Astarion,"True, if he ever branches out from fighting the Infernal, he'd be a formidable threat."
Astarion,"The Absolute may be gone, but others will rise against us. Maybe even our old allies."
Astarion,We may need a purge or two. Just to secure our position.
Astarion,Tell me how to complete the ritual and I might spare you.
Astarion,Don't you tell me what I needed!
Astarion,"All you had to do was stand there! But no, even that was too much much to ask."
Astarion,"I was so close. I could have had it all, but you took everything from me."
Astarion,Cazador won after all. I'll never escape the hell he built.
Astarion,"And if I can't escape, then no one can. Not them..."
Astarion,And certainly not you.
Astarion,Don't you dare! I CAN FEEL THEIR POWER FLOWING INTO ME!
Astarion,"But if I complete the ritual, think of the power I'll have. With me by your side, we can save the city - we can save ourselves!"
Astarion,Stop bleeding - it's distracting.
Astarion,"Trust me, I know what I'm doing."
Astarion,Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. Maybe it doesn't matter.
Astarion,He's not wrong. There's always going to be a part of him in me.
Astarion,Pull him from the coffin.
Astarion,Tell me how to complete the ritual.
Astarion,Stab him without a word.
Astarion,I'm waiting to hear you beg for your life.
Astarion,Oblivion can be arranged.
Astarion,All right. You can live.
Astarion,Get over here. We can do this.
Astarion,We'll fix what we can.
Astarion,Stab him without another word.
Astarion,Then tell me how to complete the ritual.
Astarion,Then do! Slake your thirst.
Astarion,Use the staff to destroy the prisoners.
Astarion,Use the staff to set the prisoners free.
Astarion,Destroy the staff so they can never escape.
Astarion,They're not my concern.
Astarion,I simply do not care.
Astarion,That depends. Can you swear to me you won't feed on mortals?
Astarion,You don't have to eat rats. Feast on a lion or a dragon - just not people.
Astarion,"Do what you like, it's none of my concern."
Astarion,Start killing people and I'll stop you. Just like I stopped Cazador.
Astarion,Try to remember the runes on your back and carve them into Cazador's flesh.
Astarion,Just kill him.
Astarion,Give him his wish - kill him.
Astarion,Walk away.
Astarion,And here I mistook you for someone with taste. A pity.
Astarion,"You know, we could always make our own entertainment, darling. Get a little closer, so to speak."
Astarion,Don't be so sour. I like a good time as much as anyone.
Astarion,Never listen to your second thoughts. They always spoil the fun.
Astarion,"Do what you like, but you're dealing with the consequences."
Astarion,"Let's wait until things quieten down. Once the others are asleep, we'll find each other. "
Astarion,"You can try, but I will stop you. Just like I stopped Cazador."
Astarion,What do you want it to mean?
Astarion,Then you can bear my runes and be sacrificed in my place.
Astarion,Try not to die.
Astarion,You're leaking.
Astarion,You owe me.
Astarion,"The tadpole is gone, which means your future is mine to decide."
Astarion,"Hahaha! Don't be stupid, darling. You're mine, remember?"
Astarion,Just when I thought I couldn't love you any more.
Astarion,Looks like your toy has other ideas. I think you're stuck with it.
Astarion,Don't. People ask questions when bodies start appearing.
Astarion,Perhaps it needs a magic word? Try 'please'. Or 'sledgehammer'.
Astarion,Enter your companion's mind and see the scars through their eyes.
Astarion,Carve the symbols into his back.
Astarion,Begin the ritual.
Astarion,This feels incredible. I'm a new person.
Astarion,Bow before the greatest vampire the Sword Coast has ever seen!
Astarion,"It doesn't feel much different, honestly."
Astarion,Kill Cazador and abandon the ritual.
Astarion,It means you're free - you can do whatever you want.
Astarion,What a pretty thing. I imagine it's dangerous - most pretty things are.
Astarion,"Yes, yes, fine. It's just - specific. Why not kill the gnolls or goblins rampaging around here?"
Astarion,"Let's go, we've wasted enough time talking."
Astarion,That bad.
Astarion,"Ah, travelling far and wide, seeing all this world has to offer. A fine life indeed."
Astarion,"I admit, since my ascension it's been a charmed existence. Everything I ever wanted is right at my fingertips."
Astarion,"We've already had one heart-to-heart - best to leave it at that, don't you think? I'm not sure I can manage another bout of sentimentality."
Astarion,"You're not done already, surely?"
Astarion,"You can't want to go already. Enjoy tonight, celebrate with our sweet friends."
Astarion,"And when you're done, we can get back to enjoying forever together."
Astarion,"We have eternity for chit-chat, my love - the others only get you for tonight. I can't keep you all to myself."
Astarion,Power and prestige? Hail the Grand Duke indeed.
Astarion,Grand Duke Ravengard!
Astarion,People are fickle beasts. What makes you think they'll welcome you as their protector? 
Astarion,You think the city will welcome you as grand duke? Horns and all?
Astarion,You're joking. Please tell me you're joking.
Astarion,It's time to exterminate them. To cleanse my city of their filth.
Astarion,"Now that I can enjoy the sun without needing their parasite, the mind flayers serve no further purpose."
Astarion,My dark forces are at your command today. We have a common goal.
Astarion,What do you think you're doing? 
Astarion,What are you doing?! Stop it!
Astarion,"A soul after my own heart! Assuming you have any soul left, of course."
Astarion,"But I am glad to see you're living life to the fullest. We deserve nothing less, you and I."
Astarion,"Gods, really? Well, if that's what tickles you, I suppose."
Astarion,Into the shadows.
Astarion,"Alas, not every deal with a devil works out as well as it did for me."
Astarion,"Oh, that is excellent! I had hoped you would cause a little chaos down there. And some carnage to boot by the sounds of it."
Astarion,"Well, it sounds very enjoyable to me, so I trust you're having a darling time. "
Astarion,"Well, I shall be sure to let you know if I spot any."
Astarion,"Thankfully we're just two good friends, reminiscing and enjoying life."
Astarion,"The Blade of Frontiers, famed for protecting the weak and slaying monsters. I hope you don't think either will be necessary tonight."
Astarion,"Please, when have I ever behaved?"
Astarion,"Ha! Oh no, my boy. I haven't felt weak in a long, long time."
Astarion,She must be at camp. I think she was getting a little too hot under the collar.
Astarion,The feeling is very mutual. Even if I was laughing behind your back.
Astarion,My murderous little friend! What have you been up to? Fallen back into old habits?
Astarion,"Well, that's a relief. I didn't want to ruin a perfectly good evening by having to kill you."
Astarion,Never mind a perfectly good set of clothes. This cloth stains at the slightest drop of blood. It's awful.
Astarion,"Ah, a sensible pastime indeed. You must tell me all about it sometime. I'm sure I'd find it fascinating. "
Astarion,"Ah, a mutual interest! You must tell me all about it sometime - if only to make sure our plans don't clash."
Astarion,My first and oldest friend. The last six months have been kind to you.
Astarion,"A blessing, no less? Well isn't that just darling?"
Astarion,"A pity that you let the real blessing slip through your fingers, of course. Though we all make mistakes."
Astarion,But I am glad you came - and I genuinely mean that. An evening like this would not be the same without you.
Astarion,Hold on - we're a body short. Where's Karlach?
Astarion,My children! What a beautiful sight.
Astarion,Strange... I miss him. More than I thought I would. 
Astarion,I suppose we'd better honour Gale - perhaps there's a library somewhere that has a bar and a room full of virgins.
Astarion,Leave no trace.
Astarion,On the hunt.
Astarion,"I suppose we'd better honour Gale, - perhaps there's a library somewhere that has a bar... "
Astarion,"Do they? Well, there must be something to it, then."
Astarion,Now they see me...
Astarion,"By all means, go and live however you wish. As long as we don't get in each other's way, I'm sure all will be well."
Astarion,"At this point, you've earned it. Just don't start any grand designs, and I'm sure we'll all stay friends."
Astarion,I suppose you're right. We've been through enough.
Astarion,It's not so bad in the dark. Only about half of the Baldurian sewers are active.<br>
Astarion,"The Underdark? Now that's a thought. Just not to the Drow - they don't treat pretty boys too kindly. Or any boys at all, really."
Astarion,The Underdark is a popular option. Just try to avoid the vampire spawn - I can't promise they'll be as friendly as yours truly. 
Astarion,Yes! We should see if the Elfsong's still standing. It's been so long since I've had a fine wine. And we have more than earned it.
Astarion,"Yes! We should see if the Elfsong's still standing. I won't imbibe, but I'll be happy to be away from here, and in your company. "
Astarion,"I honestly don't mind what we do, once we get - ow!"
Astarion,What the - oh no. Oh gods.
Astarion,Well... it was nice while it lasted.
Astarion,"Argh! I'm sorry, I - I have to go!"
Astarion,"You are braver than I could ever dream to be. I hope we will meet again, on a cloudy night."
Astarion,"The Blade of Avernus, fresh from the Hells. And how are you enjoying your infernal crusade?"
Astarion,You - what? Now? After all this?!
Astarion,Now there's a sight to see. Not that I'll miss them... No offence.
Astarion,"Of course, it did cost us a wizard. But - well, it was his choice."
Astarion,"Of course, it did cost us a wizard. Poor Gale."
Astarion,"The tadpole - I can't feel it anymore. And here I was worried I'd become some grotesque, deformed beast."
Astarion,"The tadpole - I can't feel it anymore. Thanks to that bomb of his, I'm not going to turn into a mind flayer!"
Astarion,"The tadpole - I can't feel it anymore. Thanks to that bomb of his, we're not going to turn into mind flayers!"
Astarion,The wizard did it... he really did it. He blew up the brain. 
Astarion,"And here I was worried I'd become some grotesque, deformed beast."
Astarion,And I didn't even have to turn into a mind flayer to do it!
Astarion,"Speaking of githyanki, will you be joining them, Lae'zel?"
Astarion,And we didn't even have to turn into mind flayers to do it!
Astarion,And I'm still standing in the sun. This is incredible! Maybe whatever it changed in me was permanent?
Astarion,Ha! Victory! Our enemies are dust at our feet.
Astarion,I - I can't feel the tadpole. It's gone - we're free!
Astarion,"No, stop you fool!"
Astarion,"Lae'zel, don't - Stop!"
Astarion,Well that's a pleasant sight. Here's hoping they stay in their own plane.
Astarion,"Speaking of the Astral Plane - aren't you going to join them, Lae'zel? "
Astarion,Now there's a sight to see. Not that I'll miss them.
Astarion,We're free of that stupid parasite. And I'm free to enjoy all the power Cazador left me.
Astarion,"Although I suppose there is a lot to do here - power to consolidate, a palace to claim. It will take time."
Astarion,"Well no, I have had a busy schedule. I've been mixing with Baldur's Gate highest society, after all. Making connections, gaining influence - finding my place in this beautiful city of yours."
Astarion,"People like us cannot just put on and cast aside the trappings of power. We're special, you and I."
Astarion,Suit yourself. Sweet dreams.
Astarion,The pleasure is all mine. Sweet dreams.
Astarion,You rest. I'll keep watch.
Astarion,You sleep. I'll keep watch.
Astarion,I need some time to think things through. To process this.
Astarion,I'll be awake awhile yet. Today has been a lot.
Astarion,I'm in no place to rest yet. Today has been a lot.
Astarion,Curling up in the dirt and resting is... a little novel.
Astarion,"The night normally means bustling streets, bursting taverns."
Astarion,"No, I'm more than happy to put my feet up. I'm just not used to this."
Astarion,"It's all a little new to me, I admit."
Astarion,"I suppose. I'm not sure what I expected, really. This is all a little new."
Astarion,"So, we're resting here? Turning in for the night?"
Astarion,Shadowheart seems jumpy. Must not relish the thought of sprouting tentacles.
Astarion,Your gith friend seems on edge. Mustn't relish the thought of sprouting tentacles. 
Astarion,Do you mind? I'm brooding.
Astarion,Your magician seems dour tonight. Must not relish the idea of sprouting tentacles.
Astarion,"You know, if you want to spend time with me you only have to say so."
Astarion,But suit yourself. I'm sure we'll drift off at some point.
Astarion,"Ah, no - tea isn't really my drink."
Astarion,I'll be awake awhile anyway. I need some time to think things through. To process this.
Astarion,Indeed you did - I'll make sure the plebs of this city know who they should thank for their continued existence.
Astarion,Baldur's Gate will never forget it. And neither will I.
Astarion,Really? Good gods.
Astarion,Good! You should always be comfortable in your own skin. Even if that skin is new and... glistening.
Astarion,Behold my tears.
Astarion,Apologies. I just got swept up in - well - surviving.
Astarion,"I would say no offence meant, but... well. Look at you."
Astarion,"Oh, eh - sorry. I didn't mean to... well, you know."
Astarion,Understandable. Can't say I'm a fan either. It's just hard to join in when all of this feels so new.
Astarion,"You may be mortal, but you look... well, happy. And you wear it rather well."
Astarion,"Or... projected? Honestly, if I'd known this was an option, I would have stayed at home too."
Astarion,"Oh yes, the war! Forgive me, it slipped my mind entirely."
Astarion,"It's good to see you too. A pity we can't share a drink, it's been too long, darling."
Astarion,"I have been rather busy, you see. I'm now a man of power and influence - it doesn't leave much time for indulging in treats like this."
Astarion,Well... Maybe a little. But I'm not complaining - anything that means I get to see my old friends again.
Astarion,"I wasn't sure you'd want to stay on our humble plane. You haven't gone native, have you?"
Astarion,"Oh, been indulging your appetite, have you? So have I, as it happens."
Astarion,"You should visit some time. Now that I'm a man of influence, I'm sure we could satisfy any cravings you had."
Astarion,"Of course I did - look at me! I have it all - power, riches, influence. What more could I want?"
Astarion,Bit of a grim mood tonight. Sounds like the others don't relish the thought of sprouting tentacles.
Astarion,"Esteemed company included, I'm sure. I am a man of influence now, after all."
Astarion,"Lae'zel, was that... a joke? Do you need to lie down?"
Astarion,Remember who saved you.
Astarion,"Well of course you did, my sweet. Who wouldn't miss such esteemed company? "
Astarion,"Gale, are you brooding? Because I swear, if you ruin my good mood..."
Astarion,"Now, now, children - let's not lose our heads. Figuratively or literally."
Astarion,"Gale, please. This is not the time to be morosely lost in thought."
Astarion,"Such nobility and self-sacrifice. I thought a mind flayer might have a stronger sense of self-preservation than that, but... well - goodbye. "
Astarion,As long as you're not expecting anyone to follow you... I wish you all the best. Though I have a feeling you'll be just fine. 
Astarion,You wound me - I thought we had something. Two kindred spirits with shared interests in darkness and grief.
Astarion,What do you say? Because I think we've earned it. 
Astarion,"That time locked away in your temple has done you no favours, darling. I've been out in the world, living, and look at me now!"
Astarion,Just like old times.
Astarion,Oh yes? Good for you. I'm sure it's been very emotional and... good.
Astarion,"It's just not especially interesting, that's all. I was really hoping for some sex or violence. You know: something fun."
Astarion,"Yes, that's the spirit! Claiming your place in the world - not letting anyone stand in your way. We're two of a kind, really."
Astarion,"Oh my sweet, so good of you to notice."
Astarion,"I've been living, you see. Sampling every titillation and vice this world has to offer. And it offers a lot."
Astarion,The Grand Duke himself! Come to walk amongst the plebs?
Astarion,"You're a man of power now, Wyll. However you introduce yourself, you will always be the Grand Duke."
Astarion,Shar's greatest apostate. Although you seem to be doing rather well without 'the Lady'.
Astarion,"Well, yes, I suppose I am rather special. I've become a man of some influence since we last spent any quality time together."
Astarion,I'll see your 'reckless abandon' and raise you 'unrestrained hedonism'.
Astarion,"I'm not sure about 'drink in hand', but I think we've all earned some reckless abandon."
Astarion,"If you need a place to recuperate, you're more than welcome to visit my palace. It is rather decadent, you know."
Astarion,"The matriarch of the Sharran temple herself! I'm honoured, your Lossness."
Astarion,"I am a little surprised, I wasn't sure you'd come walk among us who have so much."
Astarion,That doesn't sound especially Sharran of you. But what do I know - I never had much time for gods.
Astarion,But this is not the night to split hairs. It's a night to celebrate our past and toast our future. 
Astarion,Such ambition - you make me look positively humble. 
Astarion,"I can't fault your ambition. I don't know if I'd pick a fight with Mystra myself, but more power to you."
Astarion,"A little demeaning to go running to your god after everything we've achieved, but if that's what it takes to survive... "
Astarion,How about you? Any thoughts on what's next?
Astarion,"Although it seems not everyone is in the mood to celebrate. What's happening in that head of yours, Gale?"
Astarion,"Well, that's enough world-saving for one day. If any other existential threats appear, someone else can handle it - we are finding a tavern and celebrating."
Astarion,"Well, if that's everything - and I sincerely hope it is - we should find a tavern and celebrate. We've certainly earned it."
Astarion,"So, what next? Something fun, I hope?"
Astarion,"So, what's next for us? The world is our oyster, and she has many pearls we can choose from. "
Astarion,I do wonder how he'll fare when Mystra decides to crush him. It could be quite the show.
Astarion,I've never been on first-name terms with a god before. It could have its perks.
Astarion,I can't imagine Mystra will take it... lying down? Floating? However gods relax.
Astarion,"Still, good luck to him. I'm sure he'll go far."
Astarion,"Now, Gale, you're looking decidedly 'thinky'. I hope you're not about to spoil this excellent, excellent plan."
Astarion,"But if you ever decide to hunt them, know they include your children."
Astarion,"But first, you and I are going to find the most hedonistic establishment in this city, and we are going to have a night that will go down in legend."
Astarion,"I hope the nights and shadows treat you well. You're an odd friend. But, I suppose, a friend still. "
Astarion,"It's good to see you, old friend + additional nodes if needed for reactivity to the mindmeld of what the player mind flayer has been up to."
Astarion,It's been a while... how have you been?<br>
Astarion,Wait is that Tav?<br>
Astarion,Mindflayer!<br>
Astarion,She really is the truest embodiment of her people's spirit.
Astarion,I wonder where she is now?
Astarion,I wonder what the Emperor's been up to?
Astarion,At least he got what he deserved (had his head exploded by the brain OR been killed by us directly.
Astarion,A travesty to have lost such a noble fighter<br>
Astarion,She was a hell of a fighter - she'll be fine.<br>
Astarion,"She did good. Real good. It's not fair that she can't be here to reap the rewards, to live her life."
Astarion,How dare you speak ill of him! We owe him our lives.
Astarion,Well of course I don't want to. But if they get in my way...
Astarion,Six months until he's free? You little rat.
Astarion,Hells. They've taken the Blade to his final frontier.
Astarion,Let's have a little fun.
Astarion,Ready or not...
Astarion,A shame to have lost the princebut better to die a hero than live a monster<br>
Astarion,"May her flame burn forever bright, wherever she is."
Astarion,Poor/brave/selfless/whatever this companion would say about Gale. We owe him a debt we'll never be able to repay.<br>
Astarion,He did the right thing/he shouldn't have done it - whatever this companion would say about Gale blowing himself up.
Astarion,"Maybe it's better if we're friends for now? You're precious to me and I don't want to lose you, but this is a lot."
Astarion,"I don't know, it is a big change. And as much as I care for you... I don't know."
Astarion,"As much as I want to, I'm not sure if I can."
Astarion,Do you still want to be together?
Astarion,I'm glad. Although I'm not sure what the expectations are around... us?
Astarion,"Well, what are you? Is the person I loved still in there?"
Astarion,"Dead or alive, the Absolute will claim you!"
Astarion,"How neither one of us is free. How Cazador's still out there, and you're-..."
Astarion,Let's find some prey.
Astarion,"How I'm free of Cazador. How I have a whole new life stretching out in front of me, and you're-..."
Astarion,Hello darling.
Astarion,"Karlach, no - fight it. You're stronger than this, my friend."
Astarion,"Karlach... I... I love you. You taught me the impossible. In all my immortality, I'll never forget you."
Astarion,"It is indeed. We can travel the lands together, tasting everything Faerûn has to offer."
Astarion,"Before long we'll have our hands on every string in this city, and they will dance however we tell them to."
Astarion,"We can start slowly - quietly charming and manipulating key figures, building up our network of puppets."
Astarion,"Anyway, taking power in this city will need to be a subtle process. We wouldn't want to spook the cattle, after all. "
Astarion,Let's hope they have more sense than that.
Astarion,I was just thinking about freedom.
Astarion,So... we're just going to stand here and let it kill her? Is that the plan?
Astarion,You're not going to eviscerate him? I was hoping for a show.
Astarion,"Well, that's... not great?"
Astarion,Capture? And bring it where?
Astarion,"No. No, I'm quite well."
Astarion,How sensible.
Astarion,"We should go, but you have fun tracking your monster."
Astarion,No! I mean - we have different quests. I wouldn't want to distract this fellow from his path any more than he'd want to lead us from ours.
Astarion,There's a lot to know.
Astarion,"I've crossed paths with your people before, you know."
Astarion,It wasn't a good experience.
Astarion,A vampire spawn? Why? 
Astarion,"The Gur help themselves, no one else. Whatever his price, it would've been too much."
Astarion,"It's a figure of speech, darling. I'd be disappointed if you trusted me at all."
Astarion,Bigoted?! If you'd seen-
Astarion,"No. No, we're done here. Let's go."
Astarion,"I had my reasons, you can be sure of that."
Astarion,"Now, if we're done, we have more important business to get on with. "
Astarion,"I absolutely, definitely will think about it."
Astarion,"He was spinning a tale, and you were falling for it. Vampires? Sacred missions? Honestly."
Astarion,He would've followed us to camp and slit our throats in the night.
Astarion,"Trust me, I did us a favour."
Astarion,"Perhaps we'll adjust, perhaps we won't, but you mean too much for me to walk away. "
Astarion,Or to make a deal with her. Probably think you can outfox the old dear.
Astarion,"Funny. I thought your people were all cut-throats, not monster hunters."
Astarion,"All right, all right."
Astarion,You're a monster hunter? I'm surprised - I thought all Gur were wandering cut-throats.
Astarion,And what is your prey exactly? Dragon? Cyclops? Kobold?
Astarion,A - Why? 
Astarion,"And return him to Baldur's Gate, no doubt?"
Astarion,"It'd make me think twice, certainly."
Astarion,Oh? What are you hunting?
Astarion,And when you find him? Will you kill this Astarion?
Astarion,You're a monster hunter? I'm surprised - I thought all Gur were vagrant cut-throats.
Astarion,I've just remembered I need to be somewhere. But good luck with your hunt.
Astarion,I wouldn't blame the vampire spawn - I hear they have to follow their master's orders.
Astarion,How do you plan to find him?
Astarion,"I'm feeling a little ill, actually. I should go."
Astarion,Well done! You found him.
Astarion,You're in the right place - there's plenty of evil here.
Astarion,"Well, you stink. I'm sure that'll protect you."
Astarion,Why should I believe anything you say?
Astarion,"I've met people like you before. You're a Gur, aren't you?"
Astarion,Why not just kill him?
Astarion,"After everything, I think I've earned it."
Astarion,So would I. And I hope we can find some place for love in our new - whatever this is.
Astarion,"A pity, because we were rather excellent together. A love for the ages..."
Astarion,"We are rather excellent together, you know. And united, there is nothing we can't do."
Astarion,It certainly is when you're around.
Astarion,"Good, because selfless as I am, I really did not want to let you go."
Astarion,I would understand if you wanted to go your own way.
Astarion,"True, it's a vast world out there; there are plenty of places to hide."
Astarion,"It's more of a gamble without the tadpoles, but maybe you're right. The best defence is a timely murder..."
Astarion,We'll do it my way.
Astarion,"True, if we can kill a Netherbrain, we can kill anything."
Astarion,"It might be days or years, but he'll come for me eventually. He's inevitable."
Astarion,"I might be free of the parasite, but Cazador's still out there. Without the tadpole's protection, he just has to find me to claim me."
Astarion,And I'm sure trouble would find us sooner or later. It always seems to.
Astarion,"That does sound tediously boring. Although, if it's with you... maybe? "
Astarion,And it would mean setting off on another adventure together.
Astarion,"And if there's a chance, no matter how small, I'm going to take it."
Astarion,You - do you think it's possible? I suppose there is a chance.
Astarion,"Although, I couldn't help but notice you said 'we' should find them."
Astarion,"True, the spawn will need someone to lead them. Otherwise they'll just be a murderous, blood-sucking horde."
Astarion,"I can't say what the future holds for us, but I know we'll be facing it together."
Astarion,And we're going to have a lot of fun.
Astarion,You - what? I didn't think you'd actually agree!
Astarion,How dare you! After all I've done for you - after everything I've sacrificed!
Astarion,"You're joking. After everything we've been through, you expect me to do manual labour?"
Astarion,"After everything, that's your suggestion? Aren't you tired? I'm tired."
Astarion,Why stop at Amn? There's a whole world out there - we just have to take it.
Astarion,"It would be good to travel. It's been so long, kidnappings aside."
Astarion,"True, we have served our respective purposes. We're free to go wherever we wish."
Astarion,"Oh, you can't mean that. After all this?"
Astarion,"I'll find some nice, dark place where neither you nor Cazador will ever bother me again."
Astarion,"Goodbye, darling. And good luck."
Astarion,"Maybe we could make a difference out there. Although, I do need to ask..."
Astarion,"It is a pity, we were rather good together. I'll never forget it."
Astarion,I can make my own way in the world. There's enough of it out there.
Astarion,I wish you well out there. Just don't come knocking on my door - I'll have a lot of hungry mouths to feed.
Astarion,Time for a new approach.
Astarion,They won't know what bit them.
Astarion,The subtle approach.
Astarion,Immortality is only as good as the life you're living. An eternity of luxury sounds a lot better than an eternity of struggle.
Astarion,"There are thousands of vampire spawn in the Underdark, just waiting for a leader. I'll find them."
Astarion,"But fine. If that's what you want, so be it."
Astarion,"And now I can see it all. At night, obviously."
Astarion,"We are rather good together, aren't we? I never saw myself as a hero, but fighting alongside you has been special."
Astarion,So. What happens next?
Astarion,And all it cost was my life in the sun. Now I belong to the shadows.<br>
Astarion,"I mean it, this is what I want. And it's the smart move."
Astarion,And if we did it together - if I came with you - who knows what we'd achieve?
Astarion,"You can't want to die like this, Karlach. Not when you could still go back to the Hells. Not when you could still live."
Astarion,"Maybe, but life is what you make it. And I want to make mine with you."
Astarion,It isn't fair. Not after everything we've been through.
Astarion,"How I'm free of Cazador. How I have a whole new life stretching out in front of me, and you... you won't be able to join me, will you?"
Astarion,Gale? You have a look. I'm not sure I care for it.
Astarion,"Well I care for that even less. Let's make sure we prevail, then. "
Astarion,"Think about it: in the Hells I never have to fear the sun, I can kill anyone I want, and I'll be with you."
Astarion,I... I don't know what to say. Thank you.
Astarion,I know you - I saw you in my dreams.
Astarion,Well that's just disgusting.
Astarion,"Well. That's that, then."
Astarion,I see. And how does this newly-evolved version of you feel about me?
Astarion,"No, I think you're right. It's probably best to leave things here."
Astarion,"Thank you, my love. Thank you."
Astarion,And what you did for me.
Astarion,I'll never forget you. I'll never forget what you did for this world.
Astarion,That's it! We have to use the Netherstones on the Crown - it's the only hope we have.
Astarion,"But even if we can't, I'll never forget the person you were. I'll never forget what you did for this world."
Astarion,"Don't threaten me with a good time, darling."
Astarion,And Zariel will be far too busy with Raphael to worry about scouring the plane for you.
Astarion,We've dealt with the parasite. And you dealt with Cazador. I'll never be in someone's power again.
Astarion,How I'm free of the parasite - free of Cazador. How I'll never be in someone's power again.
Astarion,"How neither one of us is free. How Cazador's still out there - how you're... you're coming to the end, aren't you?"
Astarion,"I see what's happening, Karlach. The end is coming. But it doesn't have to look like this."
Astarion,"So I was thinking; where can I go that is devoid of sunlight, filled with violence, and has the one person I want to spend all my time with?"
Astarion,"And I intend to. I can go anywhere, do anything, indulge in whatever hedonism or carnage I like. Once I stay out of the sun."
Astarion,"But you won't get rid of me so easily, my love. Death isn't always the end of life - that much I know for certain."
Astarion,All right. If that's what you want.
Astarion,"This would be different, Karlach. Together, we can face anything - no matter what Avernus throws at us."
Astarion,Let's raze the Hells.
Astarion,"So, Karlach... What do you say?"
Astarion,"Plus, Cazador could search for a thousand years and never find me there."
Astarion,"It can be ours, my love. The whole world - we only have to take it."
Astarion,I know what you're thinking. So let's do it. Let's seize the whole damn world and be reviled together.
Astarion,"We could do it, you know. We could rule the world."
Astarion,What in all the sweet hells are you doing?!
Astarion,"All right, it's time. Let's end this."
Astarion,Shut it out. It's on the precipice - push it over.
Astarion,"Then what are we waiting for, darling?"
Astarion,"That depends on how you define 'survived', really, but they are free. They're making their way into the Underdark as we speak."
Astarion,And your children helped me ascend to new power. How fitting.
Astarion,"I'm sorry I took your children, but Cazador's dead now. It's over."
Astarion,"Drunk young patriars, naked in the fountains! Ah, civilisation..."
Astarion,"Ever heard of a vampire called Cazador, Wyll?"
Astarion,I imagine they are.
Astarion,"Admittedly, I don't care for most people, but this is a terrible waste."
Astarion,"I - ... yes, that. That's clearly what I was referring to."
Astarion,I used to be agog at everything when I first walked in the sun. Perhaps I'm adjusting to this new life.
Astarion,And it's when you think 'agog' is an impressive word that I remember you're just a child.
Astarion,"Darling, what are you doing? This isn't safe - you can't trust him!"
Astarion,I hardly saw you at the party. Did the honest and true Blade sneak off for a little fun?
Astarion,"Oh, but you protest too much. Now I know you were practicing your swordplay."
Astarion,"The city's elite was not my target audience, alas."
Astarion,"People ask questions when members of the nobility disappear, and the last thing Cazador wanted was people asking questions."
Astarion,"Marriage, Wyll? I thought you'd have learned not to get trapped by devious contracts."
Astarion,"I'd love to come! As long as I can sit with someone fun. Mizora, perhaps?"
Astarion,Spent much time in the Underdark?
Astarion,Perfect? You try drinking an earth elemental's blood.
Astarion,A question for our master monster hunter: how would you approach killing a vampire?
Astarion,"Gods, though I've become untouchable, my precious treasure has been violated still."
Astarion,"Oh, I was going to say it looks wretched. The dark hid all the kitschy details."
Astarion,"You know, I've never seen this place in the daylight before."
Astarion,I do like it down here. It's nice. Homey.
Astarion,"Oh marvellous, you've already met."
Astarion,"True, infernal creatures can be fickle. Let's hope he gets bored."
Astarion,"Gods, whoever thought I'd be happy to see the Flaming Fist?"
Astarion,"Being in a land of cursed, angry shadows, you start to see things in a new light."
Astarion,"I can't imagine getting bored of all that myself, but you never know."
Astarion,"Straight from the neck is preferred, but goblets are used in mortal company. They save on awkwardness."
Astarion,"We could share a drink some night, if you're curious. A nice red wine in your goblet, of course."
Astarion,I know what's done is done - you made your vow. But I'm sorry all the same.
Astarion,None taken. Wiliness keeps me alive. More or less.
Astarion,"I thought the same, once. It didn't last."
Astarion,"The sun was banished from my life - forbidden. And we all lust after the forbidden, don't we?"
Astarion,That's not the point - you shouldn't have to 'put up with it'.
Astarion,Probably. Although I am two hundred years out of practice. Running water is no place for vampires.
Astarion,But perhaps I'll join you for a dip once everything is done. Then we could see who's best.
Astarion,'Care' is a strong word.
Astarion,These woods feel unsettling - like they're dangling on the edge between life and death.
Astarion,Funny. Very funny.
Astarion,"It's just a little friendly advice: don't underestimate how this curse will get to your head, in time."
Astarion,"Yes, but you chose darkness. I was cast into it."
Astarion,Just curious.
Astarion,Of course they built an indestructible super-Watcher. Why wouldn't they?
Astarion,"I lived two centuries in this city, but it can still surprise me."
Astarion,Change your mind. You can feed on an animal instead.
Astarion,Approach [GEN_PlayerName3_06efd872-a64f-cae5-10f5-16759a7d6466].
Astarion,Approach [GEN_Playername4_703fdb8e-725b-280d-4ad0-a0881729ffa7].
Astarion,"No, not them. Leave and find an animal to feed on."
Astarion,She rushed off this morning. Probably some infernal business.
Astarion,I wouldn't worry. We're better off without her.
Astarion,"Oh, she probably wandered off to kill something adorable."
Astarion,She rushed off this morning. Wouldn't say why.
Astarion,"Relax, this is just a bad dream."
Astarion,Rushed off this morning. He probably remembered an overdue book.
Astarion,I wouldn't worry. We're better off without him.
Astarion,Hello? Anyone there?
Astarion,Master? I was just coming to see you!
Astarion,Hello? Show yourself!
Astarion,Absolutely. It's just that I was kidnapped by a tentacle-faced -
Astarion,Where are you?  Show yourself!
Astarion,Not anymore. I'm free now.
Astarion,"Please, you have to forgive me."
Astarion,He left. Didn't say why.
Astarion,I know what it's like to lose control over your own body. It's a wretched thing.
Astarion,It's just a test - I wasn't trying to kill you!
Astarion,"Tell her everything - the dream, Cazador's orders - all of it."
Astarion,"Let's not get into the details. If Baldur's Gate can have its secrets, so can I."
Astarion,Why not ask one of the friendly bloodthirsty warriors? I'm sure they'd be happy to translate.
Astarion,"I rather thought I was a little slow this time. Usually, they're begging me to drain them on the first night."
Astarion,"Thank you, Gale. Let us both hope that broken hearts are a thing of the past."
Astarion,My life has taken on a new aspect. It is only natural that my relationships change as well.
Astarion,"As the Vampire Ascendant, I can grant my lover immortality, and bind them to me forever."
Astarion,"When you're still full of that Netherese bile? I'll pass, thank you."
Astarion,"Do whatever you need to, but I shan't be paying my respects to any of the gods on show."
Astarion,It won't happen again. You have my word.
Astarion,"Oh, I tried them all. None of them answered."
Astarion,Approach [GEN_PlayerName2_85df4a15-4d9b-4f68-0512-d104305d8dac].
Astarion,"Bite down, careful not to disturb them."
Astarion,Stop and pull away.
Astarion,Keep drinking.
Astarion,Urgh!
Astarion,You taste like bile! What the hell is wrong with you?
Astarion,I'm sorry - I didn't want to hurt you!
Astarion,"Tell him everything - the dream, Cazador's orders - all of it."
Astarion,"'First, thou shalt not drink of the blood of thinking creatures.'"
Astarion,No. Please. Not again!
Astarion,Shadowheart. Such a grim name for such a beautiful flower.
Astarion,Noted.
Astarion,"The graveyard's ancient, but the graves are fresh."
Astarion,"I haven't set foot in a graveyard since I became a spawn, thank you. Vampires are nothing like those other undead."
Astarion,"Gods, how are we not there yet? My feet are killing me."
Astarion,"Oh, darling, would you?"
Astarion,"Please, I can barely manage my pack - you'd kill me."
Astarion,"Hmm? Oh, I was just pondering that heart of yours."
Astarion,There were times I would've been thrilled if everyone who put their hands on me burst into flames.
Astarion,"So the more you cool down, the more your love life heats up?"
Astarion,I'm sure it'll all come back to you. You'll be as depraved as the rest of us in no time.
Astarion,"I hear you were spotted being 'normal' in the Singing Lute, Karlach. Are you feeling all right?"
Astarion,And? How did you find the quiet life?
Astarion,I never thought I'd see the day - our champion of the Hells has gone soft.
Astarion,"I expected a temple to murder would be more fun. A little joyous, even."
Astarion,"Oh, I don't know - I've killed plenty of rats. I celebrated every time."
Astarion,Ah. This place never changes.
Astarion,"I know, isn't it wonderful? Endless opportunities for mischief."
Astarion,"Ah, beer. Not really my drink, you know."
Astarion,"Wallowing in filth is for pigs and children, my dear."
Astarion,Transforming into a mind flayer might have its perks. At least then I could float over this muck.
Astarion,I'll happily take you. If we survive this bugs' banquet.
Astarion,"Biting flies, midges - shouldn't nature be beautiful and serene? It looks so nice in the Upper City parks."
Astarion,Can't say I love what they've done with the place.
Astarion,"Reason enough to put them all to the sword, I say."
Astarion,What's this? A clever little hideaway?
Astarion,"A little too clever, if you ask me. Watch out for traps."
Astarion,"So Gale, how is your sad, hopeless pining going?"
Astarion,"Oh, my dear wizard. I wasn't talking about Mystra."
Astarion,"So, how was your night with Gale? Did you have a long, hard debate?"
Astarion,Snort.
Astarion,Well - yes. It was a joke.
Astarion,You actually made sleeping with a goddess sound boring. Incredible...
Astarion,I hear things got wild between you two. I hope no one was too badly mauled.
Astarion,It's bad enough having one person with fangs trying to keep control of themselves. Two of us could be dangerous.
Astarion,"Beyond that gate is the Upper City, housing the great and the good of Baldur's Gate."
Astarion,"I'm with you, my dear. Wherever this leads."
Astarion,"Cazazdor always warned us to stay clear of this neighbourhood. Never said why, though."
Astarion,"Ah. Yes, that was probably it."
Astarion,Probably best if I keep a low profile. They used to know me all too well in the Elfsong.
Astarion,I haven't survived for two centuries by being reckless. And I hope to survive at least two more.
Astarion,"So, do you have loves waiting for you once this is all over?"
Astarion,"You fight well, but you're so efficient. Why not have a little fun?"
Astarion,What a waste.
Astarion,"So, you know about these parasites. Will we survive them?"
Astarion,"And speaking personally, I intend to cheat. "
Astarion,"I heard that moan. It's the incubus, isn't it? Enjoying your body?"
Astarion,So how does Lolth feel about romance? Are you expected to bite your mate's head off afterwards?
Astarion,"I can't tell if you're joking. She is joking, right?"
Astarion,"So, what's it like caring for someone other than yourself, Minthara?"
Astarion,Gods no. It sounds like a lot of work.
Astarion,"Ah, no shadow curse, plenty of funerary decor - I almost feel at home."
Astarion,"Yes, as I said - just like home."
Astarion,We're getting close. I do believe fate is shuffling the cards for the final deal.
Astarion,So many dark nooks and crannies - this fortress is a lurker's paradise.
Astarion,Goblins are such vile little parasites.
Astarion,"Well, well. The fabled haunt of Nine-Fingers Keene."
Astarion,"I always steered clear. If Guild members started disappearing, people would start asking questions. And Cazador hated questions."
Astarion,"What a delightfully secluded alley. I would have been in my element here, once."
Astarion,A different class of person. And a different type of consorting.
Astarion,"It's a long time since I was in a house of healing. Gods, it's depressing."
Astarion,"True, although I don't heal as fast as I used to. The one downside to the tadpole, I suppose."
Astarion,"So, you and Lae'zel? Seems tense."
Astarion,"Old habits die hard, darling. Surely you know that."
Astarion,"Just as I get free from bondage, you fall into it. It'd be funny if it was anyone but you, my love."
Astarion,"Oh dear - you're not going to come over all pleasant and homely, are you?"
Astarion,"I'd much rather be outside, with the sun on my skin."
Astarion,Okay. Wonderful.
Astarion,The boat's heading to Baldur's Gate. I'm almost tempted to stow away.
Astarion,"Oh, I wouldn't actually leave. After all, where would you be without me?"
Astarion,"Just once, I'd like to find a village that hasn't been plundered and destroyed."
Astarion,"I was thinking about a warm fire and charming company, actually."
Astarion,I used to like this neighbourhood. It was quieter than inside the walls - darker too.
Astarion,"Oh, yes - slimmer pickings, but safer targets. The perfect place to learn the craft."
Astarion,"Would you believe, I've never been with a githyanki."
Astarion,"No, this place feels all too 'Underdark'y for me."
Astarion,"Haha! No, I think I will leave that honour to our esteemed friend."
Astarion,"Gods, you have so much to learn. Repeat after me: honey muffin, sweetie pie, sugarplum."
Astarion,"He's right, you're no monster. You've saved me more times than I can count."
Astarion,They weren't lovers... not in the way that you mean. They wanted me more than I wanted them.
Astarion,I used that to my advantage more times than I care to remember.
Astarion,You get to start over. To be the person you want to be - not what someone else made you to be.
Astarion,"It's all very grand, but so austere."
Astarion,But why not project power with soft furnishings and roaring fires? Maybe then I'd worship them.
Astarion,Do we have to spend so long poking about down here?
Astarion,"So Lae'zel, things seem to be getting serious with you two. Do you have pet names for each other yet?"
Astarion,"No, of course. Why stay somewhere safe and comfortable when we could be in mortal peril?"
Astarion,Try to sneak away.
Astarion,"No no - it's not what it looks like, I swear!"
Astarion,"I'm looking too, but not seeing very much."
Astarion,Another quirk of my affliction.
Astarion,Preening in the looking glass? Petty vanity? Of course I miss it.<br>
Astarion,"It's an indulgence, I'll grant you, but a weakness? A well-presented face can open a lot of doors."
Astarion,Not that I've seen this face. Not since it grew fangs and its eyes turned red.
Astarion,"To you, maybe. To me it's just another thing Cazador took."
Astarion,I've never even seen this face. Not since it grew fangs and my eyes turned red.
Astarion,I... I don't know. I can't remember.
Astarion,My face is just some dark shape in my past. Another thing I've lost.
Astarion,"And what do you see, exactly?"
Astarion,I want to know what the world sees when it looks at me. What you see.
Astarion,"I'm... not sure, honestly. It's been a couple of hundred years."
Astarion,"Well, it's not called 'Grey Harbour' for nothing."
Astarion,"Funny. And what do you see, exactly?"
Astarion,Oh. Go on...
Astarion,"Keep calm, Karlach. One bad flare and you could blow this whole place."
Astarion,Better.
Astarion,"It doesn't quite make up for the lack of a reflection, mind you."
Astarion,The only benefit to a mirror when you have my condition.
Astarion,Looking at something?
Astarion,"I have drunk. Not alcohol, of course. A bear."
Astarion,Because those with power can do whatever the hell they want.
Astarion,Well... yes.
Astarion,You can't look at the world and tell me I'm wrong.
Astarion,Is it? What good is freedom if I'm always watching the shadows?
Astarion,"We have a beautiful, bloody future to look forward to, my love. I can't be sure what it holds for us, but I know one thing."
Astarion,"Then we'll do it tonight. And come the morning, we will be together forever."
Astarion,Let's crack it open.
Astarion,"No, I'll be safe when I'm powerful enough to grind Cazador into the dust. Powerful enough to do whatever the hell I want.<br>"
Astarion,Very good. Now just tell me I'm beautiful and we can call it a day.
Astarion,"They're doing a piss poor job, then."
Astarion,They gave me a gift: the strength to take my own freedom. I'm embracing this power - you should too.
Astarion,Oh I hope so. A little corruption sounds fun.
Astarion,I spent centuries as the victim of a corrupt man. It was the mind flayers that plucked me away from that.
Astarion,Let them. Heroes are half the damn problem. Fools that believe in right and wrong - good and evil.
Astarion,Heroes didn't save me from Cazador: mind flayers did.
Astarion,"Indeed they are. Now that I can walk in the sun - well, that opens all manner of doors."
Astarion,It could open some coffins too.
Astarion,"Oh, that. A scratch. I ran afoul of a bear."
Astarion,"The strong had two centuries to pluck me from torture, but no one came. No, it was the mind flayers that rescued me."
Astarion,"This is meant to be flattery, not poetry. Just tell me I'm beautiful and we can call it a day."
Astarion,So... are you greeting invisible beings or just losing your mind?
Astarion,Losing your mind it is! Probably the tadpole - the weirdest things seem to be...
Astarion,You can do better. What else?
Astarion,"Rich of you to talk about someone else's heart, Karlach."
Astarion,"But I must admit, my chest has been feeling a touch lighter recently."
Astarion,"Yes, most things do."
Astarion,"...Right. I, um..."
Astarion,"Let's leave it there, shall we? It's been a long day and I've had all the compliments I can take."
Astarion,I have one person who trusts me completely. That's enough for me.
Astarion,Oh for a skeleton key.
Astarion,"Excuse me? I'm an eternally young vampire, not your doting grandmother."
Astarion,A crooked touch.
Astarion,"Of course, you will be a spawn before you can become a true vampire, but that's a small detail."
Astarion,"My sweet, I thought you'd never ask. "
Astarion,Perhaps we'll find somewhere we'd like to stay for a century or two - perhaps not.
Astarion,"Then you shall. We'll travel the lands together, tasting everything Faerûn has to offer."
Astarion,You'd have us debate? That Netherese jack-in-the-box should be a blip on the horizon by now!
Astarion,"You never know, a walking bomb could come in handy some day. I say he stays."
Astarion,What is it? What do you see?
Astarion,"Oh pardon, I didn't want to inconvenience you with my age-old curse."
Astarion,Easy.
Astarion,"I existed, that was enough for him. He revelled in having power over me."
Astarion,Gods above. Would it kill you to dispense a compliment?
Astarion,"All right, there are a few limited exceptions."
Astarion,Observant.
Astarion,"Mirrors aren't much use, but being reflected in someone else's eyes?"
Astarion,"What's so funny? You haven't got some laughing curse, have you?"
Astarion,"All right, just keep it down. We're conspicuous enough without your hyena call."
Astarion,"Well, I could do worse."
Astarion,How dare you! I thought we had something special.
Astarion,Really? I prefer my company extraordinary.
Astarion,"Don't thank me, thank Gortash."
Astarion,"It is. Though if the table is laden with good wine and meat, love is often left to rot with the salad leaves."
Astarion,"You're right, of course. Forgive me."
Astarion,I'd better get some beauty sleep. It seems I need it if I'm to catch up with the competition.
Astarion,"Hardly. There's also gold, sex, revenge - quite the list, really."
Astarion,And you're rather the opposite of slick. Do you have a point?
Astarion,Step one of starting a conversation: think before you speak.
Astarion,"But failing any of those, I will always settle for shallow praise."
Astarion,My - what? But I don't...
Astarion,...Excuse me.
Astarion,"What a preposterous question. Vampires can do anything you can do, and a damn sight better."
Astarion,Still. You're nice too.
Astarion,...Shit.
Astarion,"No, these tadpoles are a gift I intend to use to the fullest. You should do the same."
Astarion,Well - look at us. We've never been more powerful.
Astarion,Shouldn't take long. So many people need killing.
Astarion,"Now, if you'll excuse me, you're invigorating, but I need something more filling."
Astarion,"This is a gift, you know. I won't forget it."
Astarion,You -
Astarion,Ah! You wretch!
Astarion,Wretch!
Astarion,Urgh! Gods! Another drop and I would've burnt a hole from lips to navel. I thought we had that fire under control?
Astarion,No. Thank you.
Astarion,Gods! I'd nearly forgotten. I'm so hungry I would've bitten into anything.
Astarion,Gods! I'd forgotten about your little affliction. Hunger does cloud your senses.
Astarion,Must you take everything so seriously? We're both happy with our arrangement - that's all that matters.
Astarion,"Are you charging for this sage advice, or is sticking your nose into my business just a hobby?"
Astarion,"Oh, lots. Rhymes with 'under-sea' for one thing. Fitting, eh?"
Astarion,"But she's fine with 'the Bitch Queen'? Give her some credit, Halsin."
Astarion,"Really? Well, let's see, shall we?"
Astarion,Urgh! You taste like bile. What in the hells is wrong with you?
Astarion,Clearly.
Astarion,"It won't happen again, you have my word."
Astarion,You'd toss me aside over this?
Astarion,"And look what you've gained. Together, we can take on the world."
Astarion,But I didn't. And that's what matters.
Astarion,"I wasn't going to hurt you! I just needed - well, blood."
Astarion,It's not what you think - I'm not some monster!
Astarion,"I feed on animals! Boars, deer, kobolds - whatever I can get."
Astarion,I'm just too slow right now. Too weak.
Astarion,"At best, I was sure you'd say no. More likely, you'd ram a stake through my ribs."
Astarion,Thank you. Do you think you could trust me just a little further?
Astarion,"I only need a taste, I swear."
Astarion,Really? I - of course. Not one drop more.
Astarion,"Well, you're full of surprises."
Astarion,Ah. Of course. I shall be gentle as a babe.
Astarion,"Mhh? Oh, of course."
Astarion,That - that was amazing.
Astarion,Ah! That - that was amazing.
Astarion,My mind is finally clear. I feel strong. I feel... happy!
Astarion,Don't be so dramatic. This is just a little transaction between friends. 
Astarion,Ah! Of course.
Astarion,I was just swept up in the moment.
Astarion,But it worked. I feel good. Strong. Happy!
Astarion,"Let's make ourselves comfortable, shall we?"
Astarion,Safe to say this will never happen again.
Astarion,"No. No, of course, silly of me to even ask."
Astarion,"I'll go and find something on four legs to eat, I suppose."
Astarion,I still need you.
Astarion,"Anyway, the bear will sustain me. And it's a marked improvement over the rats and flies Cazador would feed me."
Astarion,Yet another thing we have in common. We're two peas in a pod.
Astarion,Jaheira! What do you think of me?
Astarion,It was exactly as appetising as you'd think.
Astarion,Not at all! Blood is life essence. And some creatures have so much more life than others.
Astarion,"Oh, I've never had trouble attracting foolish, pretty people."
Astarion,"Cazador gave me just enough to keep me - well, 'alive', for lack of a better word. But never more than that."
Astarion,"You think I'd kill you, just like that? Darling, I would never!"
Astarion,Of course! Is it so unbelievable that they would simply like me?
Astarion,I'm sure even I could learn some new tricks from an old veteran such as yourself.
Astarion,"Still, that was the past. I'll never have to grovel for him again."
Astarion,Exactly! I can be better than him. Stronger. More powerful. More -
Astarion,"- oh, you meant 'be kinder'? Pet bunnies, that sort of thing?"
Astarion,"I've no objection to being nice, of course. Once I have the power to bend others to my will."
Astarion,I don't intend to grovel before anyone!
Astarion,"The mind flayers gave us power, but left us to our own devices. Whatever they had planned for us, they failed."
Astarion,"And now I'm left with this gift: the strength to take my own freedom. I'm not afraid to use it, and you shouldn't be either."
Astarion,"If you insist on prying, perhaps you'd care to join us and see how much we enjoy one another?"
Astarion,And being able to walk in the sunlight opens a lot of doors for me. Maybe some coffins too.
Astarion,"But Cazador fed me rats and bugs. And when you're used to drinking from a sewer, even plonk is a marked improvement."
Astarion,"It's nothing compared to - well, other things I could be dining on. But significantly better than the rats and bugs Cazador served me."
Astarion,See you in the morning.
Astarion,Because we don't have a choice! Not if we're going to save ourselves from these worms.
Astarion,I need you alive. You need me strong. 
Astarion,"Please. Only be a taste, I swear. I'll be well, you'll be fine, and everything can go back to normal."
Astarion,I - what's this? What's happening?
Astarion,"I - yes. Yes, I ate whatever disgusting vermin my master picked. So you can see why I'm slow to trust you."
Astarion,But I do trust you. And you can trust me.
Astarion,This is not the time to start invading each other's minds.
Astarion,"You're comparing plonk to vintage wine. You can make merry with either, but they are not the same."
Astarion,"I've never killed anyone! Well, not for food."
Astarion,But it's not enough. Not if I have to fight. I feel so weak.
Astarion,There you are! My friend. 
Astarion,"Are you now? Don't make promises you can't keep, darling."
Astarion,Thankfully I've had my needs met this evening. I found a bear.
Astarion,"He took a little of my blood, I took all of his."
Astarion,"I mean - I think it was a bear? Big head, four legs, hair that gets stuck in your teeth."
Astarion,"Whatever it was, I thoroughly enjoyed it."
Astarion,So's any meal worth having.
Astarion,"I feed on animals. Boars, deer, kobolds - whatever I can get."
Astarion,For once I will happily admit it - I do. I owe you everything.
Astarion,"Moonlanterns to keep the curse back, burly guards to fight off any monsters - I could get used to this place."
Astarion,"Another ruined temple, full of foul-smelling beasts, spoiling for a fight."
Astarion,"Good for you. As for me, I'm going to drink until I'm sure I won't hear you grunting in the bushes."
Astarion,"Not what I'd call 'fun', or 'interesting', but sweet."
Astarion,"So, I see you and Shadowheart have a connection. It looks very sweet."
Astarion,I just hope she leaves you in one piece. We can't take a tenday for you to recover from whatever her idea of 'fun' is.
Astarion,"So, I see Lae'zel's marked you as her territory."
Astarion,Mmm. Delicious.
Astarion,To fun!
Astarion,Try it. You might have fun.
Astarion,And I wish I was drinking out of Cazador's skull. Life is tough.
Astarion,Although that's not to say we can't have a little fun.
Astarion,And I wish I was drinking out of the skulls of everyone who's ever wronged me. Life is tough.
Astarion,You did what you had to. Don't be ashamed that you did it well.
Astarion,Oh don't be so sour - it's a party.
Astarion,Cheers.
Astarion,To surviving!
Astarion,To victory!
Astarion,"So, what are we drinking to? Other than a pile of corpses."
Astarion,"Ha! No, it so rarely is. But it might be fun."
Astarion,"Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the beating our gith friend will give you."
Astarion,"As for me, I'm going to drink until I know I won't hear you grunting in the bushes."
Astarion,Here's to you!
Astarion,Does the drow know that? I saw how she looked at you earlier.
Astarion,"I don't know what her idea of a good time is, but it seems to involve you. I'd hate to intrude."
Astarion,Does Shadowheart know that? I saw how she looked at you earlier.
Astarion,"I'd hate to get between the gith and her trophy. No, I think we'll end this evening as friends."
Astarion,Does Lae'zel know that? I saw how she looked at you earlier.
Astarion,"Oh, a little talking, a little drinking, and - once everyone else is asleep - we get to know each other."
Astarion,"By the hells. Sex, my dear. A night of passion."
Astarion,"By the hells. Sex, my dear! Or whatever you can manage given your... situation."
Astarion,"Not that I'm judging, of course."
Astarion,"Whatever makes you happy, I suppose. As long as you don't come scratching at my door."
Astarion,I'm sure she is. If you can trust her not to bite your head off once you've done the deed.
Astarion,Really? Her? <br>
Astarion,There's no better way to unwind after a long day of killing.
Astarion,"So, has anyone in the camp caught your eye?"
Astarion,She does seem like a fun romp. As long as she doesn't bite your head off halfway through the act.
Astarion,"So, I see you and the drow have been making eyes at each other."
Astarion,"Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the drow. You have all the fun you want - if you survive the night."
Astarion,"Ha! No, my love, you and Shadowheart can hold hands all you want. It means nothing to me."
Astarion,Ha! You're braver than I thought.
Astarion,You're a conquering hero and you want to drink foaming piss?
Astarion,"Ah, a good, full-bodied choice."
Astarion,"I'm afraid it's warm, but needs must."
Astarion,"Hold very, very still."
Astarion,YHURGH!
Astarion,You're fetid - full of corruption.
Astarion,I... I suppose you have a point.
Astarion,"Easy for you to say, you won't have to taste whatever sludge is in those veins."
Astarion,"That would explain the stench, yes. "
Astarion,I already have enough illithid filth in my head - I don't want it in my stomach as well.
Astarion,"The pig's dead, my friend. Staring at it won't bring it back."
Astarion,"After all, who could resist such a delectable neck?"
Astarion,Come on. We'll never fix these brainworms if we stop and gawk at every piece of carrion you find.
Astarion,I - it's been drained of blood with wounds in its neck. It's been killed by a vampire.
Astarion,I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry you. They're ferocious creatures.
Astarion,"But don't worry, I'll keep watch tonight. We won't have to worry about nocturnal visitors. Now please, let's go."
Astarion,Yes. I know it's a waste of our time and I'm done indulging you.
Astarion,"See? Nothing. Come on, we're wasting our time."
Astarion,Who cares about some pig? It's dead - let's go.
Astarion,"Now, now, children - let's not lose our heads. Figuratively or literally. "
Astarion,You want to just team up with some blood-stained killer? Because I'm fine with that.
Astarion,And? Is it dead enough for you?
Astarion,Be careful with that one. Her idea of a good time probably involves biting your head off halfway through the act.
Astarion,"Darling, I've had a sudden change of heart!"
Astarion,Thank you. I appreciated that.
Astarion,What's your poison? Red? White?
Astarion,Well hello. Welcome to my humble party.
Astarion,"If you're here to beg forgiveness, save your breath. My cup and I are perfectly happy together."
Astarion,"Certainly better than pillow talk with your drow lover, hmm?"
Astarion,Don't you love the silence after a massacre? It's just so pure.
Astarion,"Well? Go on, then - it's rude to keep a goddess waiting."
Astarion,"Don't worry, we're all friends under the Absolute. I won't bite."
Astarion,"Astarion, but hold on-"
Astarion,"Fine, I'll do it."
Astarion,I'm sorry? You want to be bitten?
Astarion,I gave you my answer.
Astarion,"I'm sorry, but could you excuse us a moment?"
Astarion,Are you actually asking me to do this? Trading me for some potion?
Astarion,Because there's something wrong with her blood. I can smell it from here - it's rank.
Astarion,"I can't say, it just smells wrong. Unnatural."
Astarion,"Drinking it wouldn't kill me, but it would not be pleasant."
Astarion,All right. Thank you.
Astarion,"It's still a no, I'm afraid."
Astarion,I will have to decline.
Astarion,"She's almost as scary as you, Lae'zel. So naturally she gets my vote."
Astarion,Although I'm sure you'd know better than I would.
Astarion,"Watch maybe, but not intrude."
Astarion,I had no choice. As you 'monster hunters' well know.
Astarion,You're - the Gur tribe? I thought I was done with you people.
Astarion,"But if you do decide to go hunting them, know they include your children."
Astarion,Cazador turned everyone we brought him into spawn. I can only assume your children were somewhere in those wretched cells.
Astarion,"You'll find them in the Underdark, although you may not like what you find."
Astarion,I even killed a few thousand spawn while I was at it - you should be thanking me for saving you the trouble.
Astarion,"No, there's no working with the likes of them. Look at the hate in their eyes."
Astarion,Oh I don't know - this might be the perfect place for them to die.
Astarion,Look at the hate in their eyes. They won't ever stop hunting me.
Astarion,"My dear, I wouldn't want it any other way."
Astarion,What? You treacherous little shit - I'll kill you all!
Astarion,"Please, there's no need for such language. You wanted Cazador dead and now he is."
Astarion,I - I'm sorry. We were too late. Cazador had already turned them.
Astarion,You'll find them sealed in the cells below the palace. Although you might not like what you find.
Astarion,"I - I don't know for sure, but Cazador turned everyone we brought him. I can only assume that included your children."
Astarion,You'll probably find them in the cells below the palace. Although you won't like what you find.
Astarion,Thank you. And for what it's worth - I'm sorry. I wish I could return the ones taken from you.
Astarion,You can't blame a spawn for the sins of his master. Any good monster hunter should know that.
Astarion,"Spawn? I am the Vampire Ascendant, Gur. And I thought I was done with your wretched little tribe. "
Astarion,"So? If you have a problem with it, go deal with it."
Astarion,They're in the Underdark - they'll feed on the monsters down there.
Astarion,"I had no choice, I was a spawn, following orders."
Astarion,"If you want to fight, can we just get on with it?"
Astarion,It had to be done.
Astarion,You didn't think I could do it? I'm hurt.
Astarion,Well I expect you'll leave me in peace from now on.
Astarion,"Thank you, I only want to live in peace."
Astarion,"For what it's worth, I'm sorry. I wish I could bring your children back."
Astarion,...That's it? No reward?
Astarion,"But we did slay him, so... how about we call it even?"
Astarion,And I hope I never see any of you again.
Astarion,Your children among them...
Astarion,"You should know - Cazador may be dead, but there are still thousands of spawn locked up down there."
Astarion,Don't you understand? With this power I can save the city!
Astarion,I promised I'd kill Cazador. Did I not deliver?
Astarion,Walk away. Don't sacrifice what's left of your tribe for nothing.
Astarion,You're even more of a fool to stand in my way now.
Astarion,They were innocent - it would have been more evil to kill them.
Astarion,"Yes, I set them free. Including your children - they're spawn too now."
Astarion,Get out of my way. I'm in no mood to talk.
Astarion,Believe me when I say it was for the best. The pain from the hunger alone - there's nothing like it. 
Astarion,"You think that's what you wanted, but you don't know the hunger. You don't know what it turns us into."
Astarion,"Oh, I wasn't holding out for an invitation. "
Astarion,Your funeral.
Astarion,"Ha! All right, to a mountain of corpses!"
Astarion,Suit yourself. I've more than enough company.
Astarion,Cheeky little pup. I'll see you later.
Astarion,Fine. Enjoy your night with whatever goblin will have you.
Astarion,You insolent little-
Astarion,"You are an insolent little pup, aren't you?"
Astarion,But have it your way. I'm happy to entertain myself.
Astarion,I'll give you red.
Astarion,"I'm sorry, I mistook you for someone with taste."
Astarion,Nothing? How can you be so cruel?
Astarion,I have standards.
Astarion,"I'm flattered, but I think not. It's not you, you understand, it's me."
Astarion,"But fine. If you're determined to ruin your evening, I won't stop you."
Astarion,Never listen to your second thoughts! They always spoil the fun.
Astarion,"Indeed you will, my love. Indeed you will."
Astarion,"Let's wait until things quieten down a bit. Once the others are asleep, we'll find each other. "
Astarion,"Well, I'd hate to get in the way of a well-laid plan. So to speak."
Astarion,"Come on. There's a spark here. I know you've felt it too, darling."
Astarion,"Really? I thought you had other company planned this evening, and I'd hate to intrude."
Astarion,What's your poison? I have - ah.
Astarion,Although you're doing well enough on your own. I see Lae'zel's marked you as her territory.
Astarion,"They died long before we arrived. Trust me, they were not the children you knew."
Astarion,"I have. I've stolen your last chance to see them, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat."
Astarion,"Because anything else would mean sending you down into the dark. It'd mean showing you the hunger in your babes' eyes and leaving you with that terrible, final decision."
Astarion,I've visited enough pain on your people. The least I could do was spare you that.
Astarion,Well that's backhanded as compliments come. Though I'll take it if it means you're done trying to kill me.
Astarion,"An astral projection? Clever girl, she's not taking any chances. We shouldn't either."
Astarion,Oh don't come crawling back. It's just embarrassing.
Astarion,How about some rest? It's been quite an evening.
Astarion,I'm afraid I'm all out. This party is more humble than I'd like.
Astarion,Do you mind? I have a bottle to finish.
Astarion,"Please, don't count me out just because of your condition. I'm always up for a challenge."
Astarion,A bed and so much more.
Astarion,"Well, you have fun. I'm more than happy with my cup anyway."
Astarion,"Are you now? Well, lucky her."
Astarion,Well hello. What's on your mind?
Astarion,"So, given that we are fresh out of alcohol for you, what shall we get up to?"
Astarion,Although you're doing well enough on your own. I saw how the drow looked at you.
Astarion,Although you're doing well enough on your own. I see you and Shadowheart have a connection. It looks very sweet.
Astarion,"Not quite yet, love. Let's wait until they're asleep."
Astarion,"Oh, how ignorant of me. So it'll be free of foul-smelling beasts, then?"
Astarion,Let's see where the night takes us.
Astarion,I hoped you would come.
Astarion,"The sun can't harm me, Cazador can't compel me. I'm the only person who can stop him."
Astarion,"Now go, before I change my mind about roasting you, brother."
Astarion,You owe your wretched life to my friend. Now tell me what I need to know.
Astarion,I'm the only one who can.
Astarion,"The sun can't harm me, Cazador can't compel me. I don't need to fear him anymore."
Astarion,"You can't believe that, Dal. When has Cazador ever shared power? "
Astarion,Poor fools. They actually think Cazador will save them...
Astarion,You sound surprised - I am capable of doing the right thing from time to time.
Astarion,Yes. And they'll be trembling in fear when they tell him.
Astarion,"They're no threat to us, and they have no choice but to do Cazador's bidding. I pity them."
Astarion,"Worst of all, they don't know their fate's already set. They're doomed."
Astarion,The only question is whether their lives will be sacrificed to a monster like Cazador or serve a greater purpose.
Astarion,"Seven sigils on seven spawn, and Cazador has the other six. We have to face him and take that power for ourselves."
Astarion,"Trust me, I'd rather slaughter someone else's family, but... if that's what it takes."
Astarion,And it's not like they're sweet innocents: they brought Cazador just as many victims as I did.
Astarion,"You're not getting sentimental, are you? I thought you were with me on this."
Astarion,And spend every day looking over my shoulder? Waiting for someone to grab me and drag me back to the shadows?
Astarion,I'm more than what I was. And I'm not afraid of anything anymore.
Astarion,I'm going to stop Cazador.
Astarion,You can't believe that. You can't be that stupid.
Astarion,Keep talking.
Astarion,Cazador won't free you - he's going to sacrifice you in the ritual.
Astarion,The 'Master' promised you freedom? And you believed him?
Astarion,Sounds like a delightful dinner plan. Perhaps I'll join you.
Astarion,"I'll be blunt, then. Cazador plans to sacrifice us all at his 'ascension' ritual."
Astarion,Where is this ritual happening? Where can I find Cazador?
Astarion,Tell me about this 'ascension' - what's Cazador planning?
Astarion,I'm going to kill Cazador. Just tell me where to find him.
Astarion,I have more than quips. You have no idea what I'm capable of.
Astarion,"No, I won't spend eternity as a fugitive. I need to end this."
Astarion,Why should Cazador ascend? I'd make a much better master than him.
Astarion,Not if I kill him first. I just need to know where this 'Black Mass' is happening.
Astarion,I'm Cazador's doom.
Astarion,Cazador promised you freedom? And you believed him?
Astarion,Cazador promised you your freedom? And you believed him?
Astarion,"You were never burdened with intelligence, Petras, but your load seems especially light these days."
Astarion,"That's no way to welcome back a brother, Dal. Didn't you miss me?"
Astarion,"You always were an idiot, Petras."
Astarion,You heard them. Tell me what I need to know. Now.
Astarion,"If the Mass goes ahead, you'll be dead, not free. Cazador intends to sacrifice you."
Astarion,"Besides, I'll need something to protect me from the sun if things don't work out with our parasite friends. This ritual could set me free."
Astarion,"And you want what's best for me, surely?"
Astarion,Then you'll help me in this. Nothing would make me happier.
Astarion,"Well, it might be. And there's only one way to find out."
Astarion,It doesn't feel like a lie. It feels like exactly the kind of power Cazador would chase.
Astarion,"Perhaps, but if I don't confront him some day, I know I'll spend the rest of my life running from him."
Astarion,"And if I can take this power from him, it would set me free. Truly free."
Astarion,I have to know. I have to face him.
Astarion,"Yes, but only because of the parasite. This would be true freedom."
Astarion,Don't tell me what to do!
Astarion,Where is he hiding? TELL ME.
Astarion,"It comes with a cost, yes. All great things do."
Astarion,That orb seems powerful. What can it do once it's extracted?
Astarion,It's enough to put you off tentacles for life.
Astarion,"The Elfsong Tavern used to serve excellent calamari. Mind you, that was two hundred years ago..."
Astarion,"Gods - we're not back, are we?"
Astarion,"I don't care what's in every mind flayer colony, Gale - nobody does. Except you."
Astarion,"I am enjoying our walks together, aren't you, Gale?"
Astarion,"I gave my return to Baldur's Gate a lot of thought. I never pictured this, though."
Astarion,"Less 'quiet party with friends', more 'days of hedonistic debauchery'. But otherwise, yes."
Astarion,"From sweet woodland to stinking swamp. Can you do tricks like that, Gale?"
Astarion,It might be useful. Who knows?
Astarion,I'm not afraid of the old man.
Astarion,I am. More sure than I've ever been.
Astarion,And just think - I could rid myself of the mind flayers' parasite without losing anything.
Astarion,I knew I was right about you. You're a true friend.
Astarion,Then we'll deal with it! It can't be worse than everything else we've faced.
Astarion,"And now that we know he's skulking beneath his palace, we can take the hunt to Cazador."
Astarion,Well figure it out. I need to know I can rely on you.
Astarion,"All right, let's go. This place stinks of rat blood and despair."
Astarion,"Well yes, technically only I will ascend and gain the ritual's power."
Astarion,"But we're a team. If I become all-powerful, then we become all-powerful."
Astarion,"We are a team, aren't we? You're still with me?"
Astarion,"In fact, I'd be more powerful than ever. More powerful than any vampire has ever been."
Astarion,"Why thank you, darling."
Astarion,I knew I could count on you. It's that killer instinct I love so much.
Astarion,I knew I could count on you. We share that killer instinct. 
Astarion,"And now we know that Cazador's skulking somewhere beneath the palace, it'll be infinitely easier to track him down."
Astarion,"Still though, a living vampire..."
Astarion,Who wouldn't be interested? It's the ultimate freedom.
Astarion,"Freedom from the hunger, freedom to live a real life in the sun - no tadpole required."
Astarion,"And if I were to ascend instead of him: freedom from Cazador, once and for all."
Astarion,"Perhaps, but it's a devils' deal. They always have some loophole or another."
Astarion,But there's nothing to be afraid of - we're a team after all.
Astarion,"I have missed you. And now you're all mine, and I'm all yours. Until morning at least."
Astarion,You have no idea what I can do. Tell me where to find him or I'll make you pay.
Astarion,I can show you real power. Right now.
Astarion,"I'm amazed you managed to keep your mind clear enough to fight, I've been thinking about our last night together ceaselessly."
Astarion,"I wouldn't say that. Even the most powerful vampires in history couldn't survive in the sun, but it seems I can."
Astarion,No more surprises. You have my word.
Astarion,Shall we go? There's a long day ahead of us.
Astarion,There now. We're all friends again.
Astarion,"I wouldn't recommend it. I won't get you, but the mind flayers might."
Astarion,"Quite the opposite. I'm here in the spirit of openness and honesty, to work together as a team."
Astarion,"They're not wrong. We're bound together, no matter what comes."
Astarion,"She's not wrong. We're bound together, no matter what comes."
Astarion,"He's not wrong. We're bound together, no matter what comes."
Astarion,Although there's still time.
Astarion,I'm just glad you're being sensible about these revelations. I was worried people might turn up with torches and pitchforks.
Astarion,"But now that the air's clear, we should probably get moving. There's a long day ahead of us."
Astarion,Oh you're such a sweetheart.
Astarion,"That's my theory, but who knows?"
Astarion,"As for my other quirks - well, we can figure those out in time."
Astarion,"Standing in the sun, wading through a river, wandering into homes without an invitation - they're all perfectly mundane activities now."
Astarion,"Oh, I certainly can, it would be my pleasure."
Astarion,"Ah, you need a bit of enticing, let me see."
Astarion,How about this one:
Astarion,"Every time I heard the Tieflings cry, I remembered how you sounded crying for me."
Astarion,"But you... you I'll remember. Have a fine evening, dear."
Astarion,"In all honesty, it is a shame. That time was special to me. I've gotten on my back ten thousand times or more, and forgotten half of them."
Astarion,"Well, well, excuse me while I die of a broken heart."
Astarion,"I look forward to the day. Meanwhile, my hunger for you will only deepen."
Astarion,"If you don't remember how much you enjoyed it last time, I would like to try again, until you can think of nothing else."
Astarion,"By all means, do something less exceptional, and think of me while you're doing it."
Astarion,"When I'm with you, I feel practically alive, yet I crave only to die again with you."
Astarion,Not half as sweet as when I tasted you.
Astarion,Someone - or something - wants me alive. They've changed the rules.
Astarion,"I am, it's hard not to with you."
Astarion,I'll be waiting.
Astarion,"Well, it can be true, if only for tonight."
Astarion,"Ah ha, but a rather beautiful lie, nonetheless."
Astarion,How about if I said these little words... Everyone's favourite...
Astarion,"Well, they worked on you last time, didn't they?"
Astarion,"I can go on all night with the flattery, but is that really all you want?"
Astarion,Every part of your perfect body whispers temptation - it's as if the Gods made you just to ruin me.
Astarion,"Hmm, let me give it another go:"
Astarion,Oh I don't know. It might be worth it.
Astarion,"Perhaps I am. For two hundred years, the sun would have turned me to cinders. Now I stand here like it's nothing."
Astarion,"Oh, I've no idea. For two hundred years, the sun would have turned me to cinders. Until the crash, when I woke up bathed in its light."
Astarion,"Oh no, I should be cinders in this light. I hadn't seen the sun for two hundred years before we crashed here."
Astarion,Let him go.
Astarion,Cazador's doom.
Astarion,I'm something new.
Astarion,The greatest vampire that ever lived.
Astarion,Hold him to the light.
Astarion,The sun can't harm me anymore.
Astarion,"Listen to me, damn it! I'm trying to save you, even if you're too stupid to see it."
Astarion,"I admit, I wasn't the best brother to you, so let me make it up to you. Let me save you."
Astarion,"Tell me what I need to know, or I swear you'll burn."
Astarion,"Dalyria, I know you're smarter than this. Tell me what I need to know."
Astarion,"Fine, go and die for your master if that's what you want."
Astarion,"Nothing. Die if you want to, Petras."
Astarion,Tell me where he is.
Astarion,He'll destroy all of you if the Black Mass goes ahead.
Astarion,When has Cazador given us anything other than beatings?
Astarion,Your only hope of freedom is his death. So tell me where he is.
Astarion,Believe what you want - I'm done with you.
Astarion,Elevated? You're deluded.
Astarion,"Walk to the window, into the sunlight."
Astarion,You can be free without him. You can be powerful without him - I am the proof.
Astarion,Grab him by the throat and drag him towards the sunlight coming through the window.
Astarion,You have no idea what I can do.
Astarion,"Alas, I'm just a spawn. All of the hunger, few of the powers."
Astarion,And you're lucky I'm not a 'true' vampire. Last night could have gone very differently if I'd magically summoned a pack of wolves.
Astarion,"Oh, I have no idea. By rights I should be cinders in this light. But someone - or something - is keeping me alive."
Astarion,"Of course, I can't summon wolves or turn to mist like a 'true' vampire. Being a spawn has its drawbacks."
Astarion,Indeed it could. These are very helpful in a fight.
Astarion,Well. I hope there are no bad feelings.
Astarion,Morning. I hope last night's little unpleasantness hasn't left a bad taste in your-
Astarion,A pity. Just be grateful I'm not a 'true' vampire.
Astarion,"If you still serve him, I'll kill you too."
Astarion,"A bite from them and you might wake up as a vampire spawn, like my good self. All of a vampire's hunger, but few of their powers."
Astarion,It'll pass. Just be glad I'm not a 'true' vampire.
Astarion,Good morning. How do you feel?
Astarion,"Maybe it's just me, but I don't trust someone who worships the god of tyranny to share his power."
Astarion,Time to pay Gortash another visit. I'm sure he'll want to know all about this. 
Astarion,Only one left to slaughter now. It's quite the habit we're building.
Astarion,"I really hoped we could avoid being pawns for a dark god, but here we are, I suppose."
Astarion,What Black Mass? What's Cazador planning?
Astarion,There won't be any Black Mass - I'm going to kill Cazador.
Astarion,"Be grateful I'm not a 'true' vampire, then."
Astarion,Do I? Well I'm sure we can work something out.
Astarion,I'm glad you see it too. Baldur's Gate will never forget what you did - what we did.
Astarion,"Although - well, better you than me."
Astarion,Let's clean this up.
Astarion,"Tripped, did you?"
Astarion,"Ah, nothing says 'true love' like faking your own death to avoid someone."
Astarion,"Easy now, let's not do anything hilarious."
Astarion,"It's not your day, is it?"
Astarion,Need a hand?
Astarion,I've got you.
Astarion,Your saviour is here.
Astarion,Salvation is here.
Astarion,Infuse it.
Astarion,An extra bite.
Astarion,"Elemental, my dear."
Astarion,Add a little bite.
Astarion,"Might I suggest getting it back? We can't have anything happen to our favourite sorcerer now, can we?"
Astarion,"Oh don't be such a pill, darling. We're just having a little fun."
Astarion,"If you say so. You're the conduit for raw, cosmic power after all."
Astarion,"All right, if you say so."
Astarion,Bad place for a nap.
Astarion,Neither the time nor the place.
Astarion,Typical.
Astarion,Not the time!
Astarion,You're wasting my time.
Astarion,Up. Hurry!
Astarion,Get up!
Astarion,Die on your own time.
Astarion,You can die later.
Astarion,Get back in the fight.
Astarion,You'd be dead without me.
Astarion,A pretty thing. And at least it offers us some protection from the tadpole.
Astarion,"Might I suggest getting it back? I don't travel with you for your personality, you know."
Astarion,I swear...
Astarion,"What are you - have you never decapitated a corpse before?! Urgh, what a waste..."
Astarion,On your feet.
Astarion,"Up, damn it!"
Astarion,"Get up, damn it!"
Astarion,"I'm more than happy to kill this - whoever he is, but tell me there's something in it for us?"
Astarion,Hardly a good time.
Astarion,You die when I let you.
Astarion,"I admit, I like this one's approach. A little genocidal, but effective."
Astarion,Up. Now!
Astarion,I... forgive me. 
Astarion,"Let's finish up here and then get away from that damned plant. Until then, we'll keep you safe."
Astarion,It took your power and your sense of humour? How wretched.
Astarion,Don't linger.
Astarion,On my way.
Astarion,Be quick.
Astarion,Let's move.
Astarion,Quickly!
Astarion,With finesse.
Astarion,Moving.
Astarion,This will do nicely.
Astarion,Step quick.
Astarion,Keep them guessing.
Astarion,On the way.
Astarion,Outmanoeuvre them.
Astarion,Hear that? Our drow friend won't last long. Pity. 
Astarion,Hear that? Our friend Nere won't last long. Pity. 
Astarion,Time for a cull.
Astarion,Hungry for the slaughter.
Astarion,Let's have some carnage.
Astarion,I'm ready.
Astarion,Of course they did. Why would anything go our way?
Astarion,Get up and kill something!
Astarion,This way.
Astarion,"Yes, here."
Astarion,"Your sense of humour is still intact, at least."
Astarion,"Let's finish up here quickly - the sooner we can get your magic back, the safer we'll be. Until then, try not to die."
Astarion,Don't flatter yourself.
Astarion,"'Nothing' is doing a number on you, then, but suit yourself."
Astarion,"Oh, pardon. I'll leave you to drop dead in your own time, then."
Astarion,"You look drained, and I know it wasn't me. Is the plant bothering you?"
Astarion,Give me an edge.
Astarion,They'll feel this.
Astarion,Over here.
Astarion,A very pinchable pocket.
Astarion,The softest touch.
Astarion,What can we rescue?
Astarion,Don't look now...
Astarion,Some mild larceny.
Astarion,A little chicanery.
Astarion,Let's have a rummage.
Astarion,A better position.
Astarion,Time to move.
Astarion,Let's cut a purse.
Astarion,Let's spill some blood.
Astarion,"Let's try to survive, hmm?"
Astarion,You listen all you want - but it can get the hells out of my head.
Astarion,"Don't worry, I'm here."
Astarion,Death doesn't become you.
Astarion,Just a moment...
Astarion,"It's all right, I'm here."
Astarion,"Don't worry, I've got you."
Astarion,"Aww, look who's all grown up."
Astarion,"Let's just go, Nere and the Moonlantern be damned. After everything we've been through, I think we can handle a few shadows."
Astarion,The name sounds familiar - I hope we didn't meet on one of my little excursions.
Astarion,"People need killing, darling."
Astarion,Let's get you moving.
Astarion,Let's get you free.
Astarion,"Really, darling?"
Astarion,"Hardly the time, dear."
Astarion,We need you alive.
Astarion,Help is here.
Astarion,Be there in a moment.
Astarion,The Towers must be close. And finding Moonrise means finding answers.
Astarion,"Stay strong, darling."
Astarion,You're not going down.
Astarion,A little pick-me-up.
Astarion,Healing touch.
Astarion,Devious.
Astarion,A little spice.
Astarion,Quickly.
Astarion,Quick and easy.
Astarion,Let's not dally.
Astarion,Let's try this.
Astarion,You're useless dead.
Astarion,Does this look like camp to you?
Astarion,No need for that - Nere's is the only head that matters to us.
Astarion,Rest when you're dead.
Astarion,You can die on your own time.
Astarion,Naturally they fell.
Astarion,"I'm one of the reasons people fear the shadows, but even I'd rather investigate this Moonlantern before going to the surface."
Astarion,"Afraid of the dark, are we? Very well - let us save Nere, if we must."
Astarion,"Excellent. The less time I have to spend with these underdwarves, the better."
Astarion,"Excellent. The less time I have to spend with these underdwarves, the better. Present company excluded, of course."
Astarion,"If the cure's in Moonrise, we should go, Nere and his lantern be damned. After all, 'shadows' will be the least of our worries if we start to turn."
Astarion,Of course they fell.
Astarion,You're not dead yet.
Astarion,Hardly the place.
Astarion,Not your best moment.
Astarion,"Hold on, I'm coming."
Astarion,Some repartee.
Astarion,A little tête-à-tête.
Astarion,"I want to wake up beside a handsome virgin every morning, but life doesn't give us what we want. Can we kill this 'god' now?"
Astarion,What? You're bowing to this gutter-throated idol?
Astarion,You wretched little worm. I'll show you murder worthy of a god!
Astarion,Lend me your ear.
Astarion,Time for a word.
Astarion,Pity we're just talking.
Astarion,"Just a talk, then."
Astarion,Hello lover.
Astarion,How about this?
Astarion,"Look, I'm all for killing him, but what's in this for us?"
Astarion,Let's see.
Astarion,What have we here?
Astarion,Now that's hospitality. The fungus could teach our druid friends a thing or two.
Astarion,Very well then.
Astarion,Let's see here.
Astarion,"No, someone's coming. And someone else wants us to know..."
Astarion,Oh hello.
Astarion,"It's never good news with a mysterious voice, is it? Always 'warning, demons', never 'warning, nymphs bathing nearby'."
Astarion,"If they ask for a sacrifice, I'd suggest virgins. Young and hot-blooded."
Astarion,Let's gossip.
Astarion,Stay with me.
Astarion,Let's not die yet.
Astarion,It's not your time.
Astarion,You are not dying. 
Astarion,"You're not going to let him talk to you like that, are you?"
Astarion,A helping hand.
Astarion,Stay in the fight.
Astarion,Now that's how you motivate the staff.
Astarion,A quiet little word.
Astarion,A quick profit.
Astarion,Like candy from a gnome.
Astarion,And now we go.
Astarion,Time to go.
Astarion,"Just as well, perhaps. Beat anything for long enough and it'll snap."
Astarion,Well would you look at that. The forge can't be far now.
Astarion,Better safe than stiff.
Astarion,Here you go.
Astarion,Lucky I'm here.
Astarion,Back to the fight.
Astarion,"Hells, you actually did it. I'm... happy for you? I think. "
Astarion,There's blood in the air.
Astarion,I feel alive.
Astarion,What will they say?
Astarion,My confidant.
Astarion,That's enough wasted blood.
Astarion,Let's fix what we can.
Astarion,Healing. How novel.
Astarion,Hold still.
Astarion,"Magic that drains life? Oh dear, someone's out of luck."
Astarion,Shhh. Just think sneaky thoughts.
Astarion,"Shut up, shut up, SHUT UP."
Astarion,"Oh yes, that's yours all right. Even stale, I'd recognise that bouquet anywhere."
Astarion,Excuse me? I'm not some bloodhound tracking your scent. I'm of a much higher pedigree.
Astarion,"Be very, very quiet - I'm hunting idiots."
Astarion,"I've got a brand new torture chamber, so come and play with me."
Astarion,Let's grab what we can.
Astarion,A peek won't hurt.
Astarion,Just take a peek.
Astarion,I'll be right back.
Astarion,Oh. Oh dear.
Astarion,Hello there.
Astarion,A partner in crime.
Astarion,"Ah, my friend."
Astarion,Delicious.
Astarion,"Well look at you, killer. I didn't know you had it in you."
Astarion,To the death!
Astarion,Just a moment.
Astarion,A little boost.
Astarion,Someone needs a little help.
Astarion,This should help.
Astarion,A friend in need.
Astarion,While they're busy.
Astarion,Where would you be without me?
Astarion,What a mess.
Astarion,"Coming, coming."
Astarion,"All right, I'm coming."
Astarion,I have to do everything.
Astarion,"Come on, get up."
Astarion,"Come on, move."
Astarion,"Easy, I'm here."
Astarion,A little chit-chat.
Astarion,Me to the rescue...
Astarion,Why do beautiful people taste better? It hardly seems fair on the ugly - they have such wonderful personalities.
Astarion,Ugh. Strahd wouldn't put up with this shit.
Astarion,"Villains! Dissemble no more, I admit the deed! Tear up the floor - here, here! It is the beating of his hideous hea- oh, no, that's his brain. Where did I leave that heart?"
Astarion,"Fine, I'll save you."
Astarion,Someone needs help.
Astarion,"Well, look at you. You've come a long way from the scowling little Sharran I pulled a knife on."
Astarion,"Really? I suppose that's good to hear, after what we went through. "
Astarion,"I am flattered you noticed! I have been doing rather well, actually. All things considered."
Astarion,"We've all faced challenges, I'm sure. Your loss of faith, my loss of... the sun."
Astarion,How romantic.
Astarion,"And who better to be standing by my side than you, who helped me get them?"
Astarion,Stop bleeding!
Astarion,"Hah! Oh that was very, very satisfying. Who better to test these new powers on?"
Astarion,Thaniel? Didn't Halsin mention him? Something something spirit of the land?
Astarion,"But the important thing is we survived. And for as long as we survive, we can thrive. "
Astarion,You're looking well. It seems Grand Duking suits you.
Astarion,"Oh, you get used to them quickly enough. At this point you'd look strange without them."
Astarion,Don't do anything stupid - just say he's right and get us out of this!
Astarion,"Besides, people care more about the good you've done than how you need your hats tailored."
Astarion,"And you have done an awful lot of good, Wyll. During our time together and every day since then."
Astarion,"Yes, I've seen it. The city pulling together, under their new Grand Duke's leadership. You've been busy."
Astarion,"Well, at least you purr for me..."
Astarion,Sounds like fun.
Astarion,Let's fix that.
Astarion,I'll take that.
Astarion,What fun.
Astarion,Quietly.
Astarion,With ease.
Astarion,"Easy, I've got you."
Astarion,Get moving!
Astarion,Let's go - there's killing to do.
Astarion,"Come on, people need killing."
Astarion,Not the best.
Astarion,You're wasting blood.
Astarion,We need your blade.
Astarion,Naughty naughty.
Astarion,A light touch.
Astarion,Just to be safe.
Astarion,Let's grab it.
Astarion,That's mine.
Astarion,A fine souvenir.
Astarion,Let's have that.
Astarion,It's mine.
Astarion,Let's go already.
Astarion,Can you feel death's cold grip?
Astarion,Let's play.
Astarion,You're mine.
Astarion,'Reeducation' sounds an awful lot like enslavement to me.
Astarion,"Sure, fine - whatever we have to say to escape this woman."
Astarion,I'm sure that's what he's doing... 
Astarion,I'd imagine so - there's no way he'd leave someone as appetising as you alone.
Astarion,Oh dear. I assure you it's not. 
Astarion,To the death.
Astarion,A little small talk.
Astarion,Hello chum.
Astarion,"And we are flourishing, by the looks of it. I've never seen you look this comfortable in your own skin."
Astarion,"I can imagine. That sense of family, of connection - it can work near-literal miracles."
Astarion,"Look at you. An 'Avatar of Slaughter', indeed."
Astarion,And where better to celebrate how far you've come? An old haunt with old friends.
Astarion,Here we go.
Astarion,*Sigh.*
Astarion,Be brief.
Astarion,Keep it quick.
Astarion,"Oh, don't look at me. That is all yours."
Astarion,Time for some fun.
Astarion,About time.
Astarion,Delightful.
Astarion,They're a leaderless mob. How hard could it be to sneak past them?
Astarion,Go for the throat.
Astarion,Who's next?
Astarion,The dance macabre.
Astarion,Shall we dance?
Astarion,I've missed this.
Astarion,Shall we cut and run?
Astarion,"I do admire your directness, though. Quick and to the point."
Astarion,"We're all very impressed by your loyalty, but have we considered not aggravating the incredibly powerful archmage?"
Astarion,Just be quick.
Astarion,"Quick to hand someone over, aren't you?"
Astarion,This feels good.
Astarion,Time to kill.
Astarion,Let's have some fun.
Astarion,"Oh, look at this place! Gale would be salivating."
Astarion,Time to die.
Astarion,Let's dance.
Astarion,At last.
Astarion,Happy days.
Astarion,Let's turn someone inside out.
Astarion,Fine. 
Astarion,How have you survived this long?
Astarion,"It's beautiful. Strange, but beautiful."
Astarion,Get up.
Astarion,The crows will be disappointed.
Astarion,Can't we leave them there?
Astarion,"Certainly, once you evict the priests. Although I imagine the gith slaughtered them?"
Astarion,I'm carrying these people.
Astarion,Why? They'll only fall again.
Astarion,If I must.
Astarion,Mistook you for a corpse.
Astarion,Useless.
Astarion,"I'm all for it, but... well, you first."
Astarion,"It's too much, you can't take it. Get out of there, now!"
Astarion,Stop lying about.
Astarion,Mutilate them.
Astarion,Feel their anguish.
Astarion,Make it hurt.
Astarion,No escape.
Astarion,Break them.
Astarion,Spill some blood.
Astarion,What are you doing? Turn it off!
Astarion,Come on then.
Astarion,A waste of flesh.
Astarion,The dirt nap comes later.
Astarion,Well this is... different.
Astarion,An anchor around my neck.
Astarion,Of course you need help.
Astarion,Do I have to do everything?
Astarion,I won't always save you.
Astarion,"You're what? That is the only thing keeping us from a gruesome, tentacled-filled future."
Astarion,Surely there's a more tactful way to say that? One that won't get us killed?
Astarion,Oh for Gods' sake.
Astarion,Get up. Move!
Astarion,You're bleeding. Again.
Astarion,The elder brain turned her into a meat puppet. What the hells else can it do...
Astarion,It's all over your foot! Oh that's disgusting.
Astarion,Don't die yet.
Astarion,Of course you need saving.
Astarion,Are you sure about that? This all feels very... trappy.
Astarion,"I'm all for looting sacred treasure, but only if I know I'll live long enough to enjoy it."
Astarion,"The crèche is done for, but we're not. Run! Run damn you!"
Astarion,Be careful - the best cheese sits in the deadliest traps.
Astarion,Try to keep fighting.
Astarion,"You're being modest, I see how you've rallied this city behind you - what you've done to restore its glory."
Astarion,You did it. You saw the price of freedom and decided to pay it. I - ... I'm proud of you. Well done.
Astarion,"Move, damn it!"
Astarion,Not one juicy secret to be heard. Such a pity.
Astarion,Perhaps I should stretch my wings again. Who knows what people are gossiping about.
Astarion,This seems pretty red. But... urgh - no. Not even close.
Astarion,Withers certainly knows his wine. Or resurrected an excellent sommelier.
Astarion,"Withers can pluck wine from all over the world, but is there one bottle of fresh blood?"
Astarion,"Urgh, rank. I'd take 'rat' over this any day."
Astarion,"Oh, I simply must have this one. It's practically sanguine."
Astarion,"Mmm, divine! I wonder if I could get this for my own cellar."
Astarion,"Hmm. Well, they can't all be winners."
Astarion,"Gah! Who was- No. No, it's all in your head."
Astarion,Eh! Bloody stupid... something.
Astarion,Ah! Oh come on...
Astarion,Ah! Was that-... No. Probably just my mind playing tricks.
Astarion,"This is nice. A little tame compared to one of my parties, but it has a quaint charm."
Astarion,At least it's quiet here. It's good to feel safe again.
Astarion,I hope the others in the Underdark are behaving themselves without me.
Astarion,"If I get back and they've killed another gnome, I swear - someone's getting impaled."
Astarion,Just the same old chatter. Does no one here get drunk and spill secrets?
Astarion,I should take a tour. Just to see what the rest are up to.
Astarion,I will never get tired of seeing that face.
Astarion,"Hello again, beautiful."
Astarion,Oh my. This is going to be a fun journey.
Astarion,"My, my. She really has you by the unmentionables, doesn't she?"
Astarion,A shapeshifter? It could be anyone.
Astarion,"I mean - it's not me, but it could be anyone else."
Astarion,"I know that look: the 'I'm about to do something incredibly stupid' look. There are enough of them to turn us into paste, so maybe don't? Just this once."
Astarion,"You're bluffing, right? Because those contraptions could turn us to paste."
Astarion,"An ally could be useful, at least for now. And when he's no longer useful - well, we can dispose of him then."
Astarion,I must see this. Don't you dare say no.
Astarion,I have missed this place. And these people.
Astarion,"I mean, I had my hopes."
Astarion,My my. Who knew our friend had so much blood in them?
Astarion,It was a fine strike. Excellent form!
Astarion,"Call me cynical, but I'm not sure we can trust the god of tyranny's Chosen to happily share power."
Astarion,When he says 'punished' do you think he means 'locked up' or 'brutally murdered'?
Astarion,"So, the real man is still in there somewhere."
Astarion,"Good, that'll make 'getting lost' even easier. Honestly, kids these days."
Astarion,Mercy? Please - justice should be a harsh lesson. All the better to deter the next vagabond.
Astarion,I found so many victims for Cazador here. They're the kind of people no one would ever miss.
Astarion,"Oh, bravo! Encore!"
Astarion,Well... some of these people.
Astarion,Why is the night air always sweeter? It's such a rich perfume.
Astarion,"So this is what freedom feels like. Gods, I've missed it."
Astarion,Although I do like the style. 'Tortured armour' never does go out of fashion.
Astarion,"Alas, no. I haven't dared to risk it while Cazador still lives."
Astarion,"Cheeky. I've been very well behaved, thank you."
Astarion,Mostly well-behaved. I did have a little unfinished business.
Astarion,Or as well behaved as one can be while tearing through the Hells with Karlach.
Astarion,"Oh, you know, ups and downs. "
Astarion,"I haven't seen the sun since the brain fell, I'm reduced to eating vermin once more, and I can't walk the streets lest Cazador finds me..."
Astarion,"You know, when I say it out loud, there have been decidedly more downs than ups. Almost exclusively downs, actually."
Astarion,"Understandable, but try to resist the urge. I don't want to know what your clothes have been through since we last met."
Astarion,"Well, you've been busy, haven't you? Away having new adventures, living your new life."
Astarion,"You're more than capable of facing him. And killing him, one hopes."
Astarion,Thank you. I can't tell you how much this means.
Astarion,"But killing vampires is a decidedly day-time activity. For now, we can simply enjoy the night. "
Astarion,"Well of course not, darling! We've all seen what you can do against a giant, floating brain - a vampire will be a walk in the graveyard after that."
Astarion,"Of course, after you've saved an entire city, saving one more person is probably below you."
Astarion,"Not that it bothers me, of course. I've always been alone - I don't see why that would change now."
Astarion,"Alas, no. Since we lost our tadpoles, I'm just another vampire spawn."
Astarion,"If he finds me, he only has to say the word and I'm his puppet again. I can't face him."
Astarion,"Although if you wanted to help now, I certainly wouldn't say no."
Astarion,Hey! I need some help.
Astarion,"And look at you! Straight from the Hells, still reeking of brimstone. I take it you've been having fun?"
Astarion,"Hello, darling."
Astarion,"Gods, this is a nice break from the Hells, though."
Astarion,"I wasn't sold at first, but the forest is rather good for a get-together."
Astarion,You could scream bloody murder out here and no one would ever know.
Astarion,"It may just be rocks, grass, and dirt, but there is something about this spot. Some magic in the air."
Astarion,"Gods, what now? Do you have a tax collector on your tail?"
Astarion,"So, you made it? Now it really is a party."
Astarion,Do my eyes deceive me? The gang really is all here.
Astarion,And? How have our friends fared without us?
Astarion,"I wasn't sure our withered old friend could live up to his promise, but here we are."
Astarion,I'm glad. It would be so easy to go through everything we did and come out the other side bitter and twisted.
Astarion,"I do feel a little bad keeping you all to myself. After all, I get to see you every night."
Astarion,"Go on, go and mingle - enjoy your time with the others. Bless them with your presence."
Astarion,"I'll be here when you're ready. I'll always be here, my love."
Astarion,"Tempting, but you make a better ambassador for us than I do. I'll keep skulking here - I do it well, after all."
Astarion,"A pity, to have gone through all that and still not found happiness."
Astarion,I suppose going through the kind of journey we did will leave its mark. And not everyone can be as lucky as we've been.
Astarion,I would not want it any other way.
Astarion,"Go on, talk to the others. We have forever, after all."
Astarion,But they deserve happiness. We all do. And I will forever be grateful to have found it with you.
Astarion,"You, on the other hand, are perfectly suited to facing him! And killing him, one hopes."
Astarion,Please? Please come and help me?
Astarion,You there! Come here - I need help.
Astarion,"Well, that was a disaster. Can we call time on this farce? Please?"
Astarion,"I have to say, you know me better than I thought. I'll have to be more mysterious in future."
Astarion,"Well... You were right every time. I almost wish you hadn't been, but you do know me..."
Astarion,"Ha! Well, when you look this good..."
Astarion,"You're very funny, did I ever mention that?"
Astarion,"You're not wrong, but do we need to tell every stranger we meet our business?"
Astarion,"Oh you're very sweet. I wouldn't say no to some gory vengeance personally, but that was an adorable answer."
Astarion,Guilty as charged. Sometimes literally...
Astarion,"I'm not right now, but whose fault is that?"
Astarion,"Excuse me? I've been happy, thank you very much."
Astarion,"Oh my love, how could I say no?"
Astarion,"Oh, I like these two. All zeal and no brains."
Astarion,Well. Quite the page turner. I'll get back to it when I have more time to focus.
Astarion,You can't be serious. Give it to me this instant!
Astarion,That looks terribly heavy. Why don't you let me carry it for you?
Astarion,Wait! Don't interrupt them.
Astarion,Turning your back on the needy to save your own skin? Maybe we'll get along after all.
Astarion,"Really? I mean, yes, but - really? You'd tell whatever stranger just walked up and asked?"
Astarion,"Oh I like that answer. Yes, let's go with that."
Astarion,Oh yes. Yes please. 
Astarion,"Urgh, really? Of all the things you could think of - that?"
Astarion,"All right sweethearts. You dare to dance with a professional, you'll get your desire."
Astarion,"You're looking at me rather curiously. Speak up, tell us what you want to do."
Astarion,I wish... to drink. And to be drunk.
Astarion,Me too.
Astarion,"My fair consort, I can't wait to dine upon this four-course meal with you."
Astarion,Just a figure of speech. I promise not to bite down to the bone.
Astarion,"If this is the state of their camp, how bad must 'the pits' be?"
Astarion,You haven't earned the right to stare at me like that.
Astarion,"I know we don't want to draw attention, but you could've at least bitten off a toe."
Astarion,None as beautiful as me.
Astarion,He looks druidic enough to be our friend Halsin. Not that his corpse is going to be any help.
Astarion,"He looks like a druid, all right. Halsin, I presume?"
Astarion,We won't be getting any help from him. He's only good for compost now.
Astarion,"But no, there's absolutely no way this is happening."
Astarion,"Wait, I'm the one you love? Oh no - oh that's so sad."
Astarion,"A sweet gesture, but all... this? It's not really for me."
Astarion,"Oh I'm the one you love? Well my dear, how could I say no?"
Astarion,"It's a grimace, sweetie. Not off to a great start."
Astarion,"I hope you like a kiss with teeth, druid."
Astarion,"Two hundred years of slavery, and that was still the most humiliating thing I've ever seen."
Astarion,No? I want to hear every sordid detail.
Astarion,"Oh don't be like that. Not every problem has to be beaten to death, my dear."
Astarion,"Oh, it's everywhere. You ruined a perfectly good snack."
Astarion,No! What did you do?!
Astarion,Do you always take on such terrifying foes?
Astarion,"Enjoy yourself, of course, but I dearly hope you aren't only having sex because we haven't in a while."
Astarion,"Ahem. Sorry, pet, I'm not quite comfortable with doing this again yet."
Astarion,"Eugh, don't be so nice to me! It makes me want to be nice back."
Astarion,So eager! You're delicious.
Astarion,"I'm not saying we should trust a goblin, but she sounds very useful."
Astarion,"No! Stop it! Stop it, you wretched worm!"
Astarion,Damned fool.
Astarion,What are you doing?! My head - I can't...
Astarion,"I don't know what that toy of hers is, but I'm glad it's on our side."
Astarion,It's to be expected - some families just don't get along.
Astarion,"A moment of respite, perhaps."
Astarion,Karlach? Oh - what is wrong?
Astarion,"Please, it's no challenge. Just a friendly little murder between chums. "
Astarion,"Please, don't mind me. I'll just watch."
Astarion,What in the hells - get away from that thing!
Astarion,How is it shielding us? And why? Not that I'm complaining.
Astarion,Hello? Over here!
Astarion,"Consider yourself invited! Combined, we've had five hundred years to hone our talents - let's put them to bad use."
Astarion,"It's as good a reason as any, I suppose."
Astarion,"Not bad. I would've taken the whole toe, but whatever works for you."
Astarion,"Well? Go on, give him a nibble."
Astarion,Turning your back on those in need? Maybe we'll get along after all.
Astarion,"Really? We're messengers, now?"
Astarion,Yes! Let's have some fun.
Astarion,Don't be a coward. We could take them. We could kill them all. 
Astarion,Finally. Let's have some fun.
Astarion,Yay. Woo.
Astarion,"And don't worry, I'll dart out if I don't enjoy it faster than I used to run from the sun."
Astarion,Since when has yielding been an option? Gut the little rodent.
Astarion,"Ha! My, this place is fun."
Astarion,Thank you. I thought you were never going to shut him up.
Astarion,You villain! I didn't know you had it in you.
Astarion,I love it! Let's tell her everything.
Astarion,Why she sounds positively demented. 
Astarion,"I'd like to try doing things like this again, now I'm free to find my own desires."
Astarion,What? No. Don't you dare. This isn't funny.
Astarion,"Oh good, puns. Because clowns aren't enough of a horror already."
Astarion,You could've at least let him grovel a little.
Astarion,A nice touch.
Astarion,You could at least offer to help! 
Astarion,"Well, I had some unfinished business that I needed to take care of."
Astarion,"But you always were full of surprises, weren't you?"
Astarion,Ha! After everything we went through? You earned those and so much more.
Astarion,"Oh, I haven't forgotten. I have vivid memories of our time together."
Astarion,"Of course you have, darling. For mortals and gods alike."
Astarion,Or here I am. I'm not sure about you.
Astarion,Don't be touchy. I'm sure he meant 'better off dead' as a compliment.
Astarion,Don't be touchy. I'm sure she meant 'better off dead' as a compliment.
Astarion,Don't be touchy. I'm sure they meant 'better off dead' as a compliment.
Astarion,"Some of us are dead and doing very well, thank you."
Astarion,"Agreed. Let's go, we have places to be. "
Astarion,"By all means, avenge Shar, but can we do it later? The worm is more important than your piety."
Astarion,Don't waste your time hoping. It's probably long dead.
Astarion,I'm sure Shar is powerful enough to take her own revenge. No need for us to get involved.
Astarion,"Powerful enough to take her own revenge, I'm sure. No need for us to get involved."
Astarion,"Yes, there's not much we can do for dusty old soldiers. Let's get moving."
Astarion,Cut down and left to rot. Such fine armour deserved better.
Astarion,"But of course, I imagine traversing a cosmic war zone is no easy thing."
Astarion,But it is good to see you looking so comfortable in your own skin. 
Astarion,"But of course! You'll have to forgive me, I forgot to bring a shiny apple."
Astarion,"So, who am I looking at? Gale the teacher? Gale the hero? Gale the lover?"
Astarion,Broken trash. It's just full of dust.
Astarion,Let's not make trouble for some stranger. We have our own problems.
Astarion,"Well, you heard the lady. We don't want things to get 'messy'."
Astarion,"Well, no use dwelling on it, is there?"
Astarion,"Well of course you have, darling. It is not easy to replace someone like this."
Astarion,"No, I imagine not."
Astarion,"I am sorry, I wish things had worked out differently for you, but..."
Astarion,"I would ask if things have been going well, but you seem to be a literal god, so... I'm guessing 'yes'?"
Astarion,What's it like? All that power at your fingertips? All those prayers to answer?
Astarion,It's good to see you too. Corporeal or not.
Astarion,There was a time when I would have done anything to have what you have. But now? I think I would have felt more chained than charmed.
Astarion,"Well, some explosives would certainly help us free Thulla's friends. They might even survive the blast."
Astarion,"High-powered explosives do sound fun, but must we waste them saving lives?"
Astarion,"Yes, I suppose you're above the baser pleasures of life now. A pity: they're often the most fun."
Astarion,"Oh no, I've seen what too much ambition can lead to. I'm quite all right as I am, thank you."
Astarion,Not that I'm immune to the charms of your domain. But all things in moderation. 
Astarion,"And here you are, in all your robes and finery."
Astarion,"It's broken - it won't save us from a dusky evening, never mind a curse."
Astarion,Is this the Moonlantern we've heard so much about?
Astarion,"Don't get me wrong, I am happy for you. It's just that I'm happy for myself too."
Astarion,"Nothing quite so carnal, I'm afraid. I'm mostly just pleased to see you alive."
Astarion,"You know, I was concerned you'd land yourself in trouble without me to look after you. But I see you're doing just fine as you are."
Astarion,"Flying across the cosmos on the backs of dragons, waging war on your mad queen - I couldn't be more proud."
Astarion,Give me patience.
Astarion,Oh I shouldn't laugh.
Astarion,You'll be free soon.
Astarion,"Oh no, they're stuck. "
Astarion,Maybe they like being restrained?
Astarion,You look good helpless.
Astarion,"Pray if you want, but they won't thank you for it. The dead are an ungrateful lot."
Astarion,"Tsk tsk. Really, darling?"
Astarion,"There's a time and a place for violence. I mean - this place is perfect, but is it the time?"
Astarion,I'm coming.
Astarion,Let's do the job and get out of here. All this talk of slaves is just depressing.
Astarion,We have to free Nere before we can take his head? Sounds like a lot of wasted effort.
Astarion,All the charm and wit you'd expect from a slaver. Even a slaver of gnomes.
Astarion,And I was worried we weren't on the same page. Let's spill their guts.
Astarion,"Call me 'slave' again, and I'll feed you your own stomach."
Astarion,Another belligerent dwarf? This is getting tiresome.
Astarion,Something extra.
Astarion,On your feet!
Astarion,A sticky situation.
Astarion,"I - I think of you too. I wish things could have gone differently, but..."
Astarion,"In a spot of bother, hmm?"
Astarion,I shot a svirfneblin in Menzoberranzan just to watch him die.
Astarion,And look at you - still on our humble plane. You've practically gone native.
Astarion,It's as fine a reason as any. And better than quite a few.
Astarion,"It's more than we deserve, I assure you."
Astarion,"Exploring this strange world, finding your place in it, dismembering the odd assassin - I couldn't be more proud."
Astarion,"Oh, I don't doubt it. But you wouldn't want it any other way."
Astarion,"And I hear you're doing well. Leading your church, bringing the good word of loss to all that need it - you've been busy. I was worried you might not make it tonight."
Astarion,I could just leave them...
Astarion,"And worried that in your devotion, you might have handed your feelings over to Shar... Worried you'd forgotten us."
Astarion,*Humming.* 
Astarion,"I'm glad there are some limits. You can give up a lot, but lose everything and you lose yourself entirely."
Astarion,"Well, no, not 'enjoyed' exactly. But you did grow on me over time. Like a night orchid."
Astarion,Or a fungus.
Astarion,"I am very glad to hear it. After all, I rather enjoyed our time together."
Astarion,You're a danger to yourself.
Astarion,Is someone stuck?
Astarion,"Oh no, is someone stuck?"
Astarion,I should've been a drow. They have such stylish armour.
Astarion,"A pity, I rather enjoyed our time together. Treasured it, even."
Astarion,"And that would be a shame, because I've rather enjoyed our time together."
Astarion,You're more than capable of facing him - now more than ever. Killing him would be easy.
Astarion,"I am glad, genuinely. Few would make the sacrifice you did. "
Astarion,"Well, that's barely ominous at all."
Astarion,"No joy yet, but I've killed plenty of monsters on the way."
Astarion,"Cazador was still out there, after all. But with a little help from my new monster hunter friends, finding and destroying him barely took any effort at all."
Astarion,"Cazador was still out there, after all. But with a little help from some friends, finding and destroying him barely took any effort at all."
Astarion,"Cazador was still out there, after all. But with a little help from my darling love, finding and destroying him barely took any effort at all."
Astarion,"On my part, at least. They did have to tear out his tongue before I could approach safely, but we got there in the end. And what a glorious end it was."
Astarion,Oh no. 
Astarion,So helpless...
Astarion,Can't they wriggle free?
Astarion,I'll help. This time.
Astarion,"Karlach and I have been exploring the Hells together, finding each and every infernal beast that wants to kill us."
Astarion,"It's not exactly a 'good' time, but I can kill whatever I want and never have to worry about the sun, so... it could be worse?"
Astarion,It has been an experience. A difficult experience.
Astarion,But if I could go back and make the same choices again... I think I'd still be elbow-deep in cambion guts.
Astarion,"Some day I'll return to this plane for good, but right now I am exactly where I should be."
Astarion,"Likewise, if you'd believe it."
Astarion,"Perhaps, but we're trying not to get our hopes up."
Astarion,"We found some blueprints and a map to Zariel's private forge, so if we can find a smith, and get the materials, and it's not a trap - there's a chance."
Astarion,"I've been exploring the world, looking for anything that will let me walk in the sun again."
Astarion,"But yes, there's nothing wrong with being rewarded for good work. And when it comes to killing, I do very good work."
Astarion,"You do know me oh so well, don't you?"
Astarion,Perhaps more 'me' than I've ever been.
Astarion,"Exactly what I feared. Without the protection of our little friends I was just an ordinary spawn again, burning in the sun. I fled the dock and found refuge in the shadows until night fell."
Astarion,"Part of me was relieved you left so quickly after the battle. I felt... ashamed. Like I'd lost everything, just as you claimed your victory. I didn't want you to see me like that."
Astarion,"I'm sorry I didn't seek you out that night. I felt... ashamed. Like I'd lost everything, just as you claimed your victory. I didn't want you to see me like that."
Astarion,"And with Cazador still out there, I could hardly show my face. So I retreated to the sewers to hide, bide my time, and enjoy all the rats one can eat."
Astarion,"But time lent perspective. It wasn't your victory, it was ours. And for all I'd lost, I had gained so much more. I had freedom, strength - a whole new life. And it was time to live it."
Astarion,I've been seeing the world. Rediscovering what's out there after so many years under Cazador's thumb.
Astarion,"It turns out, it's every bit as dangerous travelling alone as it was travelling with you. I've killed more beasts and bandits than I can count."
Astarion,"You know, it turns out I'm rather good at being a hero."
Astarion,"But however it turns out, this isn't the last Faerûn has seen of us. Sooner or later, we will be back."
Astarion,"Yes, but you say all sorts of things. Honestly, I don't even listen half the time."
Astarion,"Well... I do try to inspire a little terror. I'm still me, after all. "
Astarion,Ha! Hardly. 'Good' people don't spend as much time lurking in the dark as I do.
Astarion,"You know it's funny, at first I thought I was trapped by the shadows - cursed to live in them forever."
Astarion,"But in time, I realised that darkness is as much a part of me as my fangs. This is only a curse as long as I refuse to embrace the shadows. So I decided I would."
Astarion,"I decided not to be defined by the choices other people made - by what other people did to me. My past may be done, but my present - my future - they're mine. "
Astarion,"No, this is all me, I swear."
Astarion,"Don't get me wrong, I was a mess at first. Every day I yearned for the sun and mourned my curse to live in the shadows."
Astarion,"Let's not get carried away, darling. I'm still me."
Astarion,"It has made for a nice change, though - inspiring hope in people instead of terror."
Astarion,"Without Karlach? No, this world just wouldn't be as fun."
Astarion,"Besides, she needs me. Who else will stab one cambion while she decapitates four?"
Astarion,I've been leading. For the first time - maybe ever - I've been thinking about people other than myself.
Astarion,"Then so be it. I've been through Hells metaphorical and literal, and this is what I am. I will not apologise."
Astarion,"They're in hands, at least. I wouldn't make a call on 'good' just yet."
Astarion,"Oh no, people can be quite meek after seeing you murder their former master."
Astarion,"And if they do step out of line, it just takes one or two brutal examples to remind everyone else of their place."
Astarion,"I'm not a tyrant, I do care for their well-being, I just can't afford to show weakness."
Astarion,"Surprisingly well, actually! "
Astarion,"Alas, I have had to get my hands dirty."
Astarion,I've taken a turn as an adventurer and hero.
Astarion,"'See you later, darling.'"
Astarion,"It turns out no one actually cares about murder, as long as you murder the right people. And apparently I'm rather good at it."
Astarion,"Go and mingle. I'll be here, darling, living my best life."
Astarion,"Yes, the right person can make just about anything bearable. And it seems like you found exactly the right person."
Astarion,I'd expect nothing less from someone of your talents.
Astarion,"No, the Hells are not known for their welcoming ambience. Although if anyone can overcome them, I know you can."
Astarion,You always brought a whiff of madness to the battlefield. I do miss it.
Astarion,You took the gold? I was rather hoping for the body...
Astarion,At least I assume it's you in there. It is a little hard to tell.
Astarion,How have you been since... everything?
Astarion,"Yes, no, of course - I'm very busy too."
Astarion,And I'm sure we're all safer for it... Probably.
Astarion,"I will miss our time together. But then again, maybe this isn't goodbye so much as it's..."
Astarion,Trading some whelp we just met for impossible power? It's a fine deal.
Astarion,There are thousands of vampire spawn in the Underdark - lost souls I lured into the shadows. The least I could do was give them a place they'd be safe.
Astarion,"So I've been building a haven down there. It's relatively small for now, but growing every day as more and more spawn find us."
Astarion,"We found some ruins in the darkness and made them our own - rebuilt walls, added touches of comfort."
Astarion,"It's no palace, but maybe someday it will be."
Astarion,"Oh, didn't you hear? It burned."
Astarion,"And when the structure finally gave way, it collapsed into the wretched chapel below. Every record of his infernal ritual is gone - we'll never see its like again."
Astarion,"Rather easily, actually. It turns out there are more than enough things willing to attack you in the Underdark."
Astarion,"And if they find themselves on the wrong end of someone's fangs, that's on them."
Astarion,"I'm all for killing her, but let's get that power first, hmm?"
Astarion,"I did at first, but then I realised - these shadows, this darkness - it's all part of me."
Astarion,"That being said, I haven't completely given up on returning to the sun. If the opportunity presented itself - well, I wouldn't say no..."
Astarion,What's happening? What did you do?
Astarion,"It's the mask - take it off, you fool!"
Astarion,You fool. Take off the mask - now!
Astarion,"But until then, I am happy."
Astarion,And to you.
Astarion,"We have had quite the journey, you and I."
Astarion,"From the moment I first threatened you, I knew you were someone special. Someone to take on the world with."
Astarion,I spent too long defined by what other people did to me. The choices other people made for me - but that's over now.
Astarion,Have a good night.
Astarion,So it would seem - the city is flourishing. The good you've done is to be celebrated.
Astarion,"Tonight, we are here, together, celebrating the good we've done. "
Astarion,All these people were ruined because of me.
Astarion,"What use is it, though? They're lost, ravenous, feral. They'd attack any mortal on sight."
Astarion,I suppose there's a good chance they will.
Astarion,"Thirsty little brats, aren't they? "
Astarion,I couldn't have put it less delicately if I'd tried. 
Astarion,"Oh, thank goodness. I was worried I'd have to get involved. Now let's keep our hands to ourselves, hmm?"
Astarion,What's happening? Speak to me. Wake up!
Astarion,Thank goodness - I was almost worried. 
Astarion,"Clingy little shit, this Absolute. And She wants to meet..."
Astarion,What in the hells - oh no. Not again.
Astarion,"No, just thinking."
Astarion,I am. I've been thinking.
Astarion,"The stars, I mean. I could take or leave your chin."
Astarion,It's quite a sight.
Astarion,I'll forgive you. I'm mostly just thinking anyway.
Astarion,"It's something of a novelty. I'm usually quite busy at night, but now I'm just lying here and thinking."
Astarion,"Might I recommend acquiring a taste for rats? They won't sate your appetite, but they help with the hunger. "
Astarion,Well that could have gone better.
Astarion,I don't know what you mean. I've never seen these children in my life.
Astarion,"Reflecting on what tomorrow might bring, when we find the druid."
Astarion,Will he know how to bring the worm under control? Will this little adventure of ours be over?
Astarion,Suddenly not having any spawn of my own sounds wonderful.
Astarion,"A spawn rises up to kill their master - a tale as old as time, it seems."
Astarion,"Maybe I shouldn't be surprised, given how things ended."
Astarion,'Velioth'? Cazador never spoke about his former master.
Astarion,Perhaps I should have kept Cazador's skull. Pity.
Astarion,"Guilds, nobles, politicians - if he controlled even a fraction of these, the city could be his and no one would ever know."
Astarion,"Thank you, my dearly-departed master. I'll put it to good use."
Astarion,Details of who pulls every string in Baldur's Gate. Just what a powerful vampire needs to make this city his puppet.
Astarion,Maybe I am. Maybe that's what I have to do.
Astarion,"Factions, nobles, politicians - he had information on everyone. If he'd ascended, the city would have been his in a tenday."
Astarion,"I'm not normally impressed by people of your stature, but you're stronger than I gave you credit for."
Astarion,You've been to the Hells and back. Survived the crash. Survived everything that's followed.
Astarion,Ha! Why not?
Astarion,"You're quite the ally, after all. Traversing Avernus. Surviving the crash. Surviving everything that's followed...<br>"
Astarion,A pity. A great pity.
Astarion,Good! I don't want you to run off just yet.
Astarion,Will she know how to bring the worm under control? Will this little adventure of ours be over?
Astarion,"Reflecting on what tomorrow might bring, when we meet this goblin priestess."
Astarion,"So, he was keeping notes on me. That would have terrified me, once."
Astarion,By the gods. One of Lolth's abominations.
Astarion,Do you mind? I was rather enjoying my view of the ceiling.
Astarion,"A Moonlantern, surely? I would love to have one of those."
Astarion,It has been an experience. And a rather wonderful one at that.
Astarion,"Ah, the bedrooms. Never once slept in."
Astarion,Awful? It's wonderful! We can kill as much as we like and damn the consequences.
Astarion,"It will grow tiresome eventually, but I hope we can find something to fix darling Karlach's engine before then."
Astarion,You wound me. A little bloodlust doth not a psychopath make.
Astarion,You should know that better than anyone.
Astarion,"Anyway, I imagine the killing will grow tiresome in time. Hopefully then we can return to Faerûn and start building a base of power through fear and manipulation."
Astarion,It has been a joy! I've been rediscovering what it means to be alive - more or less.
Astarion,I can slaughter legions of beasts down there and there's always another one just over the horizon.
Astarion,"I've been out seeing the world, visiting cities charming dignitaries, and making friends up and down the Sword Coast."
Astarion,"Rather wonderfully, actually. I have been making all sorts of new friends."
Astarion,"They're the kinds of friends that would see me burn the first chance they get, but that's all in the nature of the game, isn't it?"
Astarion,But the important thing is I am doing wonderfully. Finally having a life that's worth living.
Astarion,"And who knows what's next? There is an entire world out there, ready for the taking."
Astarion,"Perhaps the next time we meet, we'll have grander conquests to toast."
Astarion,Seems like a fitting punishment for a poet.
Astarion,"You see, this is why I always liked you. You can see the big picture - what needs to be done."
Astarion,"I did miss you, you know. There is a sense of loneliness that comes with power."
Astarion,"I'm spinning my web. Power grows slowly, but I have nothing but time now."
Astarion,"He stole everything, even his precious rules."
Astarion,"Slippery little bugger, isn't he? He'll be looking for somewhere safe - somewhere where the shadows are nice and strong."
Astarion,"No one ever died here, though. Something strange happened to that girl. "
Astarion,Sounds like an opportunity. And it would be nice to surprise the Absolute for once.
Astarion,I just... I never want to see these little scraps of misery again. The world doesn't need to know my shame.
Astarion,"Of course I deserve it, but the countless others they'd feed from... "
Astarion,"I won't have to worry about the sun, at least."
Astarion,I was in the prime of my life when I was turned.
Astarion,"Well, we can be grateful for the torches. Without them, those beasts would be on us in no time."
Astarion,Get into the fight!
Astarion,Useless!
Astarion,"This is where I took our 'guests'. I'd entertain them here, until Cazador appeared and... took them away."
Astarion,Can't you tell? Karlach and I have been traversing the Hells.
Astarion,You're wasting time.
Astarion,Can't you do anything?
Astarion,What are you doing? They're going to tear me to shreds... They'd never forgive me for what I've done.
Astarion,"I really forgot about them, felt nothing the moment I handed them over to him."
Astarion,"Quite the deviation from my usual routine, of course. Capture, not lure. I didn't bring them in with sweetrolls or anything."
Astarion,Don't look at me like that - Cazador's orders.
Astarion,"Ah. Ah-hah... yes, now that you mention it, I may have done... that. "
Astarion,"Oh Gods, it can't be..."
Astarion,"I do miss the luxuries this plane has to offer, but I must say - Avernus is second to none when it comes to bloodshed."
Astarion,"Whatever happened to that girl, it wasn't good."
Astarion,Thousands of names. This couldn't be part of the ritual... could it?
Astarion,"A list of each and every soul I owe my power to. Thank you, one and all."
Astarion,They don't know what they are - not yet. Unless we taught them to be something else... 
Astarion,There's so many. Enough for an army of mindless slaves.
Astarion,Will we find out how to bring the worm under control? Will this little adventure of ours be over?
Astarion,"Reflecting on what tomorrow might bring, when we arrive at this gith crèche."
Astarion,I'm sure I'll see you when I get back. Sleep tight.
Astarion,I was just going anyway. I need to clear my head.
Astarion,Of course. Terribly sorry.
Astarion,Oh that's grotesque. Don't stare - you'll only encourage it.
Astarion,I think I'll just - just clear my head.
Astarion,"Hmm? Yes! Of course, me too."
Astarion,"...I'm sorry, I - I need to clear my head."
Astarion,The right moment...
Astarion,"Done, nice and neat. Now, let's report to the lovely Z'rell."
Astarion,Mercy? You showed goblins mercy? The half-orc won't like this.
Astarion,"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure this is the time or the place."
Astarion,"A delicious thought, but..."
Astarion,"Sleep tight. I'll see you later, I'm sure."
Astarion,"Reflecting on what tomorrow might bring, when we get to this hag's teahouse."
Astarion,Reflecting on what tomorrow might bring.
Astarion,"Well then, let's not keep her waiting."
Astarion,"I can see the stars from Baldur's Gate, of course, but not with such clarity. It got me thinking."
Astarion,"So tell me, what have you been doing since this travesty?"
Astarion,"Of course not. I'm sure you only want what's best for Baldur's Gate, after all."
Astarion,Just as I do.
Astarion,"A purely selfless act, I'm sure. After all, you only want what's best for Baldur's Gate."
Astarion,"Oh, that is so sweet."
Astarion,"I hope you're not expecting me to say it back, because... well. "
Astarion,"No, I imagine not. What with your face and all..."
Astarion,"But, you did save the city. That has to count for... something?"
Astarion,Heavens forbid. I've learned my lesson. I just...
Astarion,"So, you really did it - you became a god. It almost makes my ascension look trivial."
Astarion,You can't be serious. You miss being weak? Falling ill? Ageing?
Astarion,"We can be honest with each other, Gale - one immortal being to another: this is great."
Astarion,"A god after my own heart, but I am more than happy with my ambitions. And I'm sure they will only grow."
Astarion,"I am a little surprised you came, I thought this plane would bore a god. All these petty mortals and their mayfly lives."
Astarion,But I suppose we should be grateful you blessed us with your presence. Praise be.
Astarion,Of course! I've tried to taste everything this world has to offer.
Astarion,"Well, not this world, exactly, but a world."
Astarion,"You know, I've been thinking."
Astarion,"You must love it - all that power at your fingertips? All those followers, worshipping you?"
Astarion,...I just need to get some air. Clear my head.
Astarion,Was I? I just...
Astarion,"I'll see you later, I'm sure. Sleep tight."
Astarion,Feign obedience and acceptance while you seek a means to fight back.
Astarion,You have become your own master. Deny him.
Astarion,He has no power over me anymore.
Astarion,I'll never do what he tells me again - I'd rather die.
Astarion,Well that's suspiciously welcoming.
Astarion,And behind it is the kennel - a fetid little cell he'd throw us into when displeased.
Astarion,"Behold, one of Cazador's cheapest tricks: an illusionary wall."
Astarion,And this is the kennel - a wretched little cell Cazador would lock us in when he was displeased.
Astarion,"Focus your mind to construct a mental fortress, and shelter within it."
Astarion,"I can sneak in here. Security shouldn't be too tight, a few charmed innocents, maybe."
Astarion,"Well then, shall we see what this brave new world looks like?"
Astarion,Let's get out of here. I've had more than my fill of this place.
Astarion,"Well, him and the unfortunate souls we brought to feed him."
Astarion,What in the hells? I never knew this was here. This was always Cazador's private quarters - only he ever came in here.
Astarion,There's so many of them. Who the hells are these people?
Astarion,What in the Hells - I never knew any of this was here.
Astarion,The dormitory. This is where the spawn were kept when we were getting neither the carrot nor the stick.
Astarion,He recorded thousands of names. Were they his victims or something else entirely?
Astarion,This must be the way up to Cazador's palace? Surely?
Astarion,I brought him so many people. So many wasted lives.
Astarion,I'll do whatever Cazador wants - just let me go.
Astarion,"No, what have you done? You ruined everything!"
Astarion,...get some air. Clear my head.
Astarion,"Hmm? Oh, I was leagues away. I just need to..."
Astarion,First they take Jaheira's friend and then they take her face? Oh she's going to hate that.
Astarion,That's the Minsc Jaheira's been searching for? Good gods...
Astarion,"Yes, we're more similar than I thought..."
Astarion,Aren't you just...
Astarion,"Oh, you're no fun."
Astarion,You have your charms... more than you think.
Astarion,I'd be a fool to face Cazador alone. Who knows what tricks he has up those moth-ridden sleeves?
Astarion,You're not the only one. We've waited long enough.
Astarion,"I'm not easily impressed by people, but you're stronger than I gave you credit for."
Astarion,Maybe they can be controlled just as easily.
Astarion,Cazador gave the key to Godey? And where is the sadistic old sack of bones?
Astarion,"Speak, damn it! What's going on?"
Astarion,"Well, obviously I'm on my way down now. So if you could just point us in the right direction..."
Astarion,No! What have you done?!
Astarion,I won't let you do this. I won't let you win.
Astarion,You're going to suffer for everything you did to me.
Astarion,"You, maybe. I'm more than ready."
Astarion,At least I assume it's you in there. You squids all look basically the same.
Astarion,"Well now, let's not throwing stones. Glass houses and all that."
Astarion,"I entertained our 'guests' here until Cazador appeared and took them away, but I never saw anything like this."
Astarion,A tiefling corpse - odds are that's sweet Arabella's mother.
Astarion,A classic! One good thrust to the heart and you're gone.
Astarion,"Fine, but if they botch it - don't come bleeding to me."
Astarion,"Oh, I see how it is."
Astarion,"Don't worry, darling. I like you. I'm sure I'll make the right choice."
Astarion,Then I suppose we'll just see what happens.
Astarion,"Come on, humour me. If you had to choose..."
Astarion,I've watched urchins freeze to death on the street. It looks peaceful - just like falling asleep.
Astarion,Well now you're just being close-minded. There are some lovely ways to go.
Astarion,He's just like Cazador - utterly insane.
Astarion,"Well, that's a little dramatic, don't you think? "
Astarion,"I am open to suggestions. Knives, poison, strangulation - whatever you'd prefer."
Astarion,"There's a point where bravery becomes stupidity. And walking into that would be very, very stupid."
Astarion,"Of course, first sign of change and I'll have to stop that pretty little heart of yours."
Astarion,'Yet'.
Astarion,Naturally. But I was thinking: what if it doesn't?
Astarion,"I'm not taking anything for granted, of course. First sign of change and I'll have to stop that pretty little heart of yours."
Astarion,A tiefling corpse - odds are that's sweet Arabella's father.
Astarion,Is that Arabella's mother she's tending? Our little idol thief has some terrible luck.
Astarion,Is that Arabella's father she's tending? Our little idol thief has some terrible luck.
Astarion,"We need a good blade, of course. Don't want to waste time hacking and prodding with a dinner knife..."
Astarion,"Ha! I do like you, you know. You've got fire."
Astarion,"Sweet dreams, darling."
Astarion,"I like you. Rest assured, whatever happens, I'll make the right choice."
Astarion,So can I.
Astarion,How much damage will you cause if you transform? How much blood can you bear to have on your hands?
Astarion,A pity - she was fun.
Astarion,"Don't be so pig-headed, I'm being practical."
Astarion,Keep your distance. He looks like he could burst any second.
Astarion,"It's unexpected, but we shan't complain."
Astarion,"I've seen some grotesques in my time, but this is something else."
Astarion,"Ha! Oh, my dear. I'd like to see you try."
Astarion,"Ha! Oh, my boy. I'd like to see you try."
Astarion,"Now, let's get some rest? The sooner we start tomorrow, the better our chances of keeping this hypothetical."
Astarion,"Well that's disturbing. Still better than having an actual conversation with him, though."
Astarion,"If the last day has taught me anything, it's that the impossible is more likely than you think."
Astarion,"Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. This is all a worst case scenario, obviously."
Astarion,"If they're mixed well, you'll just close your eyes and drift away. And if they're not..."
Astarion,A fine choice! I can think of some nightshades that are deliciously fatal.
Astarion,"See you in the morning. Sweet dreams, darling."
Astarion,"I have to say, I thought you'd look worse, but no. Not a tentacle to be seen."
Astarion,I saw you getting a lecture from our magical friend.
Astarion,Ha! Oh they are welcome to try. I could use a new trophy for my wall.
Astarion,"Don't get me wrong, darling, you are quite the wizard. Even Elminster's in your shadow now."
Astarion,"Best to rest now, while we still can. Who knows what's waiting in Baldur's Gate."
Astarion,"I admit, I did expect you to be a little bitter about missing out on godhood. But instead you look... happy. And you wear it well. "
Astarion,But look on the bright side - your life is yours to live. You're not bound to answer prayers or appear in visions or - whatever else gods do.
Astarion,"Yes, put the poor beast out of its misery."
Astarion,"He gave up everything to save us, Lae'zel. Is this really the best you can offer him?"
Astarion,"Lae'zel, darling - there never was one so delicious as you. Until we meet again."
Astarion,"Well, that was a kindness. Can you imagine living like that? Urgh."
Astarion,"No, power isn't everything. But it is an awful lot of fun."
Astarion,He really did give everything for his people - and for us. I hope he finally knows peace.
Astarion,I'm glad the gith prince is taking his fate so well. I'd be devastated if I was that ugly.
Astarion,"He seems to be taking his new, monstrous form pretty well. Maybe he is worthy to be your prince."
Astarion,"He seems to be taking his new, monstrous form pretty well. Maybe he is worthy to be the gith's prince."
Astarion,"He helped to kill a Netherbrain, only to be slain by one of his own... extraordinary. "
Astarion,"He helped to kill a Netherbrain only to be slain by one of his own - a little unnecessary, don't you think?"
Astarion,"Although credit where it's due - you were a worthy ally up there. If not for you, that brain may have bested us."
Astarion,And credit where credit's due - you saved us. You saved this whole city.
Astarion,It was. Thank you.
Astarion,I'm glad your prince is taking his fate so well. I'd be devastated if I was that ugly.
Astarion,"Whatever happens, I'll make the right choice."
Astarion,You finally found a place where you could talk all day and everyone had to listen to you? You must be elated.
Astarion,"You could have been a god, but I suppose 'wizard' will do."
Astarion,"I did miss you, you know. You always had such unique ideas about the world."
Astarion,"I'm happy to have more powerful friends, but... well, better you than me."
Astarion,I owe everything to that? Oh I don't like this one bit.
Astarion,I appreciate your candour. Even if you couldn't be more wrong.
Astarion,"You know, I did miss you - you were never afraid to stand up to me. Now almost everyone is."
Astarion,"Try to wound me all you like, but I'm so much better than he ever was."
Astarion,I achieved what he only dreamed about. And now my ambitions can take me anywhere I want.
Astarion,"Oh my boy, don't be like that - the Gate is more than big enough for us both."
Astarion,That orb's going to blow - and soon. 
Astarion,"Anyway, it's not like Baldur's Gate is the only city in Faerûn. I have plenty of options."
Astarion,"For all my freedom to walk in the sun, it's still much more fun to pull the strings of power from the shadows."
Astarion,"Not that everyone's on board, of course. Our friend Wyll is a stubbornly capable Grand Duke. It's been difficult to get much past him, although I will keep trying."
Astarion,"Cazador's mansion has become my palace and played host to every kind of banquet, soiree, and masquerade imaginable."
Astarion,"And of course has seen its fair share of hedonism, clandestine deals, and the occasional disappearance. Whatever it takes to build up my influence over those who matter."
Astarion,Another tentacled freak? What in the hells is this?
Astarion,"If you'd rather waste your time with them, you're entirely welcome to."
Astarion,"But not to worry, I'm sure our paths will cross again."
Astarion,"It's an honour, standing before the most famous wizard in the lands."
Astarion,"Oh I wouldn't say 'ruler', any old fool can sit on a throne. I would be more of a... puppet master?"
Astarion,"We did share a wonderful adventure, you and I. A pity to see it end, in some ways."
Astarion,"I don't think poison is for me. Nor stabbing, come to think of it."
Astarion,"Pity, I kind of liked her. Oh well."
Astarion,I'm fine. Let's just get this over with.
Astarion,Now you're happy to leave if I'm uncomfortable? How novel.
Astarion,"I would like to see her dead in a ditch, but I can tolerate this."
Astarion,"Don't worry, I can tolerate her."
Astarion,"Oh she doesn't bother me that much. If anything, I pity her."
Astarion,"I appreciate the thought, truly, but if this is something you want to look into..."
Astarion,"Well, death never stopped me before. I don't know why it should now."
Astarion,"Don't worry - if anything happens, I'll protect you."
Astarion,"Just a look. And if we don't like what we see, we can always kill her later."
Astarion,Just as long as she knows who belongs to who this time.
Astarion,"Well, hearing her out won't kill us."
Astarion,"I appreciate the thought, but I'm not the person I was the last time we met. And if she can unlock the kind of power she's promising..."
Astarion,Nor have I. No matter how hard I try.
Astarion,Are you even trying?
Astarion,"Dying, are you? Typical."
Astarion,Stop whining.
Astarion,"You are indomitable, aren't you? I'm so happy for you, Karlach."
Astarion,I'll be all right. Let's just get this over with.
Astarion,"No, give yourself some credit. You mostly ruined it all by yourself."
Astarion,And I will keep refusing until the end of time. I'm done bowing to the whims of others.
Astarion,"Naturally, I always ask first. I'm civilised, unlike you."
Astarion,What in the hells is happening here?
Astarion,Excuse me? I will not be ordered around my own house by some blow-in mutt!
Astarion,You useless little...
Astarion,But we have great new lives stretching out before us. And great new adventures to go on.
Astarion,You're new. Cazador never kept guard dogs before.
Astarion,Just try to survive.
Astarion,"There's writing like this all over the palace - some old, probably dead language of Cazador's. We were strictly forbidden from learning it."
Astarion,There are inscriptions like this all over the palace. Cazador strictly forbade us from learning the language.
Astarion,"I'm so pleased your mind survived the transformation intact. As for the rest of you... well, your mind survived and that's what matters."
Astarion,"I will never forget the time we spent together, though. And I know you'll never forget me."
Astarion,I trust you haven't forgotten what happened when I drank something she offered? This 'formula' won't be any kinder to you.
Astarion,What are you doing? That had better go down the drain and not down your gullet.
Astarion,Do not trust anything this woman says. And certainly don't drink anything she offers you.
Astarion,Say no - the only thing she's offering is pain and I don't want to see you hurt. 
Astarion,"If that's her 'formula' I can smell, it's even fouler than her blood. Gods below..."
Astarion,They said 'no'. You should learn the meaning of the word.
Astarion,He said 'no'. You should learn the meaning of the word.
Astarion,She said 'no'. You should learn the meaning of the word.
Astarion,"Until next time, darling."
Astarion,"Strange little beast. I would've made short work of it, once. "
Astarion,You're being held up by a snack. Leave the rodent and let's look around.
Astarion,"Are you really being waylaid by a snack? Let's just look around, vermin be damned."
Astarion,"What's not to like? We kill some horrible beastie, and I get what I want in return. Everyone's happy."
Astarion,Except the beastie.
Astarion,Let's not be so hasty - we might enjoy doing the devil's dirty work.
Astarion,And it's all for a good cause - me.
Astarion,"Rotten meat? That's what gets you going? Well, to each their own."
Astarion,You are absolutely vile. Gods above.
Astarion,"Well, that's what you get for being greedy."
Astarion,I saw our gith friend inspecting you.
Astarion,"But what's done is done, so how about we stop discussing it and just kill this beast?"
Astarion,So. Not a tentacle to be seen.
Astarion,Is that blood on the shelves? Probably cold and congealed - urgh.
Astarion,"Arabella's father. First the druids, now this - our little idol thief has no luck at all."
Astarion,Not a good end. Doubly so if your little girl's asking strangers to find you.
Astarion,"Indeed you could. We're all doing surprisingly well, given the circumstances."
Astarion,"A fine choice. Now, to use sword or axe? Or a saw? Hmm."
Astarion,But we were talking about you. What'll it be?
Astarion,I've always felt decapitation was a fine choice. One good swing and then - nothing.
Astarion,"I do like her spirit. I don't like her chances, but her spirit? Excellent."
Astarion,Sounds like you've been learning all about your gruesome future.
Astarion,It's you - our little idol thief from the druids' grove!
Astarion,"I - perhaps I should have, but I'm not used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."
Astarion,"Wait! Before you go, I have a proposal of my own."
Astarion,Either I'm getting dumber or those rats sound a lot smarter than before.
Astarion,"And it is the rats, to be clear. The rats sound smarter. "
Astarion,"Florrick's going to be hung?... Hanged?... Either way, it doesn't sound good."
Astarion,Arabella?
Astarion,The Netherbrain is trying to get to us. Hold yourself together!
Astarion,We have to stop it - it's now or never!
Astarion,"No - what are you doing? Fight, damn you!"
Astarion,"Sweet hells! Well, that's what you get."
Astarion,"Yes, fine, we'll kill this damn creature of yours."
Astarion,Can we please kill it this time?
Astarion,So he's the one who slaughtered the Justiciars - we can kill him now?
Astarion,"Because if he doesn't die, then Raphael won't tell me a damn thing about my scars. "
Astarion,That was incredible - I'm actually impressed! You have a wicked little mind.
Astarion,Does... does that count as us killing him? That had better count.
Astarion,Pretty tune for a contract that says 'kill all Justiciars'.
Astarion,Well? Tell him. We owe the devil nothing.
Astarion,And that's the full set - everything we need to face this brain.
Astarion,A fairer deal than I expected.
Astarion,"This is what Raphael wants us to kill? Well, if that's what it takes to figure out what these damn scars mean..."
Astarion,"Wyll, Wyll, Wyll. Have you learned nothing? That's a problem for tomorrow."
Astarion,"The feeling is extremely mutual, my dear. This plane is so very dull without you."
Astarion,"Yes, if anyone can laugh in the face of damnation, she certainly can. You are lucky to have her."
Astarion,I don't know what I am.
Astarion,I can still taste that vile drow in my throat.
Astarion,"The only reason I can still walk in the day, you mean? Yes, we will have to do something about them."
Astarion,"No, I don't expect you to be. You did what you thought was right. Even if you were objectively wrong."
Astarion,"I'd live with the risk of something going wrong. Of the tadpole finding some new trick, reasserting itself, and making me a slave again."
Astarion,"Controlling them may still be an option, but it's a dangerous game."
Astarion,"Of course now that I'm free from one threat, we'll have to face the other: the tadpoles that let me walk in the light."
Astarion,Perhaps. But it'd be worse again to pretend it never happened.
Astarion,Assuming I have a life to build. It's a little hard to plan anything knowing there's still a tadpole burrowing its way through your brain.
Astarion,"Cazador took up so much room in my life - my memories of him, my need for revenge. Now there's just a blank space where he used to be."
Astarion,Instead I just feel... blank? I suppose not wielding the blade myself makes a difference. It's all a little anti-climactic.
Astarion,I thought things would feel different when he was gone. That I'd be revelling in my freedom. 
Astarion,I'll try to restrain myself if you do. Shall we?
Astarion,Something I haven't shown anyone else. 
Astarion,You couldn't wait ten seconds before being an absolute freak?
Astarion,"The enthusiasm is appreciated, but hopefully not."
Astarion,"Perhaps, but some things are classics for a reason."
Astarion,Throwing your body at someone becomes second nature. And I just did it again.
Astarion,Yes it was.
Astarion,It's all right. I didn't expect myself to feel anything.
Astarion,I'm so used to my body being used as a tool to get what someone else wants. But I'm free now. It shouldn't be like that.
Astarion,"You made me see I never stopped thinking like I was still his slave, even in freedom."
Astarion,And every instinct I have tells me that nothing's changed. That I'm still just a means to an end.
Astarion,The entire reason for my existence was to seduce anything with a pulse.
Astarion,"A moment of disgust to force myself through. And then I could have carried on, just like before. "
Astarion,It would have been so easy to bite her. To just go along with what I was being told to do.
Astarion,"It's a novel concept, I admit. And a little intimidating."
Astarion,"You could have asked me to do the same - to throw myself at her, what I wanted be damned. But you didn't. And I'm grateful."
Astarion,"I spent two hundred years using my body to lure pretty things back for my Master. What I wanted, how I felt about what I was doing, it never mattered."
Astarion,"It doesn't wipe away the stain he left on the world, though."
Astarion,For what you said while I was in front of that vile drow.
Astarion,For you maybe.
Astarion,"I was just defiled by that creature, and you let it happen. You made it happen!"
Astarion,"Really? After something like that, you think that's what I'm looking for?"
Astarion,"I didn't think twice when the moment came, but now I can't get it off my mind."
Astarion,Huh. We shouldn't be involved with each other any more. I'll sleep alone.<br>
Astarion,And you pushed me.
Astarion,It should've just been another moment of disgust for greater reward.
Astarion,I've seduced people who repulsed me more times than I can count. 
Astarion,I want to thank you.
Astarion,"Oh, I hadn't forgotten. But with you here, I am... dare I say 'optimistic' about our chances?"
Astarion,You... I want you.
Astarion,"If it has, it might be for the best."
Astarion,Now I need to figure out who I am. What I want.
Astarion,"For nearly two centuries I stalked the streets like a ghost while the person I was lay here, dead and buried."
Astarion,Exhilarating. Terrifying. Exhausting.
Astarion,"Maybe, but he did take it. There's almost nothing left of the person I was. Just a name on a rock."
Astarion,From that day on I was his. Until today.
Astarion,"Then when I finally broke the surface, retching up dirt and congealed blood, Cazador was waiting."
Astarion,I had to punch a hole in the coffin and claw my way through six feet of dirt.
Astarion,And where better to celebrate our good fortune? An old haunt with old friends.
Astarion,I feel the same.
Astarion,"Ah, so it's the healthy glow you get from being a good person? That explains my pallor."
Astarion,Nearly two hundred years and I never came back. Not since the night I woke up down there.
Astarion,This way. It's not far.
Astarion,"There's... something I'd like to show you, if that's all right? Something out in the city."
Astarion,I'll have to. But that doesn't mean I have to like it.
Astarion,"Assuming we survive, of course. Because a horrible death is always just around the corner with you."
Astarion,I think I do.
Astarion,Maybe never seeing the sun again is just the price of freedom.
Astarion,I'm glad I still have the power to surprise you. Even if it's the only power I have left.
Astarion,And fate let you get away with that? Not one improbable adventure landed on your doorstep? I'm impressed.
Astarion,But I'm more than that. More than a thing to be used.
Astarion,You were by my side through all of this. Through bloodlust and pain and misery. You were patient. You cared. You trusted me when that was an objectively stupid thing to do.
Astarion,Well. I should probably fix this.
Astarion,I will endeavour to please.
Astarion,"That's the question, isn't it?"
Astarion,Of course. That... that would mean a lot.
Astarion,I guess that depends on what your idea of 'a little fun' is.
Astarion,"Come on, let's get back to the camp. If a night of passion isn't on the cards, a night of rest would be very, very welcome."
Astarion,"Come on, let's get back to the camp. Who knows how long before the others go feral without us there to guide them?"
Astarion,Unless we die horribly tomorrow. Which is always a strong possibility.
Astarion,"We might not have forever, but we do have all the time we need."
Astarion,"I feel safe with you. Seen. And whatever the future holds for me, I don't want to lose that."
Astarion,We don't have to rush into anything tonight.
Astarion,But I do now. Being with you is about more than lust or manipulating you into a tactical alliance.
Astarion,"You know, I didn't care for you when we first met."
Astarion,"If a night of passion is on offer, I could be persuaded."
Astarion,A great deal. But nothing I can act on without burning to a crisp. But I'm willing to wait.
Astarion,"That's... interesting. I might even say I like it. And as for you and me, well, I'm willing to wait."
Astarion,"And here I thought I was the dangerous one. But I'm not so frightening after all, am I?"
Astarion,With everything that life has to offer.
Astarion,I've been dead in the ground for long enough. It's time to try living again.
Astarion,I love you. I love this. And I want it all.
Astarion,"No, I made the right choice. Although I do regret the options I had."
Astarion,"You... you are full of surprises, aren't you?"
Astarion,But I know that this? This is nice.
Astarion,"Whatever you've been doing with your time, it's clearly worked wonders."
Astarion,Love is a powerful tonic.
Astarion,"I do wonder what could have been between us, sometimes, but... well, that's dead and buried."
Astarion,You've become a traveller and a vagabond? A soul after my own heart.
Astarion,"Oh it's nothing terrible, it's just-... well, maybe it is a little terrible."
Astarion,"I - yes, all right. I can understand."
Astarion,"Of course I was attracted to you. Look at you, for goodness' sake!"
Astarion,I don't know how else to be with someone. No matter how much I'd like to.
Astarion,"Even though I know things between us are different, being with someone still feels... tainted. Still brings up those feelings of disgust and loathing."
Astarion,Of course they did - that's the problem! Or part of it.
Astarion,I just don't know what 'real' looks like. Not after two hundred years playing the rake.
Astarion,You -... you're incredible. You deserve something real. I want us to be something real.
Astarion,"And all I had to do was not fall for you... Which is where my nice, simple plan fell apart."
Astarion,It was easy - instinctive. Habits from two hundred years of charming people kicked in. All you had to do was fall for it.
Astarion,"But I'm glad to see the world has treated you well - you've earned it. We both have, in fact."
Astarion,"Yes - all right - that's more than enough comfort and support, thank you."
Astarion,"Look, I had a plan. A nice, simple plan - seduce you, sleep with you, manipulate your feelings so you'd never turn on me."
Astarion,"And you're looking more delicious than ever, if you don't mind me saying."
Astarion,"Well, I am glad it's been going well."
Astarion,Of course! A very sensible step. The last thing we wanted was another surprise.
Astarion,"But I am glad to see you doing well. I'm glad to see us all doing well, in fact. Things turned out rather nicely in the end."
Astarion,"And you're straight from the Hells, if that whiff of brimstone can be trusted. How fares the Blade of Avernus?"
Astarion,"I don't doubt it. After the things you've done, there isn't an archdevil out there who isn't watching their back."
Astarion,"That's a good war to fight, though a difficult one to win. There's always more evil out there, my friend."
Astarion,But let's not dwell on gloom - we've had enough of that already. Tonight is about celebrating past victories and toasting future triumphs.
Astarion,"Yes, once someone like that gets their claws into you, there's only one sure way to get them out again. And it isn't pretty."
Astarion,"Though I admit, I'm surprised the Blade of Frontiers has the time to come mingle with us. If the stories are true, you've been saving lives and doing good all across the land."
Astarion,So modest after achieving so much? What's the point in being a hero if you just brush off the praise?
Astarion,"Revel in it, Wyll. Let it wash over you - carry you away, even. It's a lot more fun."
Astarion,"Oh yes, I'm fine. I just-... feel awful."
Astarion,"Ha! No, I think anyone sporting your horns should know not to judge a person's form before their character."
Astarion,"Ha! No, I've seen your journey. You're not one to judge on form over character. Not anymore at least."
Astarion,"And I must say, for someone who had to face down a dark god, you seem to be doing remarkably well."
Astarion,"What have you been up to? No... relapses, I hope?"
Astarion,I am pleased to hear it. For all our sakes.
Astarion,"Not that I was worried, of course - I knew you'd have this under control."
Astarion,"I'll pass on the ale, but the company sounds delightful. "
Astarion,"Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard. Tell me, should I genuflect or merely bow?"
Astarion,"So, 'the Blade of Frontiers'? You didn't want to trade it for a flashier name? "
Astarion,Up!
Astarion,Something like that. Except... not that at all.
Astarion,Do you have a moment? I think we need to talk.
Astarion,It seems I was wrong about you. About us.
Astarion,I don't think I want you to think of me in terms of sex.
Astarion,I- I'm not sure if I should.
Astarion,"It's been so long since I've had to make these decisions for myself. I won't lie, it's a daunting prospect."
Astarion,It's just... it would have been so easy to bite her. To just go along with what I was being told to do.
Astarion,"Oh, don't look at me like that. I'm as surprised as you are."
Astarion,"Trust me, I was not happy about it. You were a complication I didn't see coming. And yet..."
Astarion,So imagine how stupid I felt when I started to genuinely feel something for you.
Astarion,"People don't trust vampires - perhaps understandably - so I needed to get someone on my side. And seducing you was easy, frankly."
Astarion,I don't know if I want anyone to.
Astarion,"Of course, I needed protection."
Astarion,"I tried to pick beautiful people where I could, but there were so many over the years. After a while you stop caring."
Astarion,Perhaps it's better if we don't continue with whatever this was. Perhaps we'll both be better for it.
Astarion,Until you.
Astarion,But a friend? I can't think of a single one.
Astarion,I've held more people than I can count. An infinite parade of lovers.
Astarion,I- I would like that.
Astarion,I... don't know. It's been so long since I've had to decide what I wanted.
Astarion,Hah! Why that almost sounds like a challenge.
Astarion,It's easy to judge a situation when you're not in it.
Astarion,"Honestly, I have no idea what we're doing. Or what comes next."
Astarion,As a person? Would that be so much to ask?
Astarion,You're a vision. And you're so much more than that.
Astarion,Excuse me? This might be the first honest thing I've ever told you and you're 'not interested'?
Astarion,"You stood up for me earlier, when that wretched drow was insisting I bite her. I appreciated it, that's all."
Astarion,"Unfortunate, because you're going to hear it."
Astarion,Now I couldn't stand to do it again.
Astarion,"I thought I could bear sleeping with you, to try and get you on my side."
Astarion,It's a game I'm tired of playing. Being used.
Astarion,But I do now.
Astarion,I didn't know how to say no.
Astarion,Of course I am - look at you!
Astarion,"For as long as I can remember, I've been used by others. Controlled and puppeted for someone else's pleasure. But not anymore."
Astarion,"Of course I did, I know that dance better than anyone. But I always felt nothing."
Astarion,"Well, you got what you wanted. An apology doesn't mean much at this point."
Astarion,"No matter what I say, it doesn't matter. Not if you get what you want."
Astarion,"This is all a game to you, isn't it?"
Astarion,It's almost funny. 
Astarion,"I suppose... If this is what you want, then I shall provide."
Astarion,I suppose it has felt different with you...
Astarion,...I don't know what to think. I don't know what I want.
Astarion,"Not last night, though. Last night I felt miserable, and it was a revelation."
Astarion,"Oh, don't spoil the mood. We're here to have a good time, after all - reminiscing with old friends."
Astarion,I know. That doesn't mean it stings any less.
Astarion,"Maybe, but even if I could control it, it's a dangerous game."
Astarion,"I admit, I do miss the luxuries of this plane. What I wouldn't give for a silk bed..."
Astarion,"But don't fear, we'll have that engine of yours fixed before you know it. And then we can return in all our glory."
Astarion,And? How have our dear friends been without us to guide and protect them?
Astarion,Really? Are you sure? I was certain they'd be half-dead and begging us to take them back.
Astarion,"Well, miracles never cease."
Astarion,We do turn every head the moment we walk into a room. And rightly so.
Astarion,"And I am blessed to share it with you, my love. "
Astarion,"I may have power, but it would be nothing without you. You complete me. "
Astarion,"And together, we are unstoppable. So Heavens help the fool that tries to get in our way."
Astarion,"No, I can see more than enough from here."
Astarion,"No, everything I want is standing right here."
Astarion,"But you should go - mingle, chat, laugh. Have fun, my love. "
Astarion,"And if our friends drop any interesting secrets, bring them right back to me."
Astarion,"Until then, I'll be here. But don't fret, I will be watching. I am always watching."
Astarion,I almost wish they would. It's been some time since we've seen a real challenge.
Astarion,"Of course, my darling. Look at us!"
Astarion,"We share a palace, share power, live lives eternal in each other's arms. What more could anyone want?"
Astarion,"An understandable urge. This place is dull by comparison, but..."
Astarion,"Really? We get to kill as much as we like, and consequences be damned."
Astarion,"Savour it while you can, my love. Tomorrow the fun begins again."
Astarion,And? Enjoying our little break from the Hells?
Astarion,"All right, but it's very much your loss."
Astarion,Excuse me? After everything you said before?
Astarion,"Indeed you will, my love. I can't wait."
Astarion,"There's a secluded place nearby that should do nicely. Wait until the others are asleep, then come and find me there."
Astarion,Let's find our own little piece of nowhere. Somewhere we can lose ourselves and forget all this madness.
Astarion,"And I do mean sex, to be clear. We've been waiting long enough."
Astarion,"A quiet evening, for once. Perfect for two people who'd like to take some time to themselves, if you catch my meaning."
Astarion,"Don't tell me you want to get back to the fight already? Relax, my love - enjoy yourself."
Astarion,"Gods, not this again. "
Astarion,"Well, look who decided to turn up."
Astarion,"Gods, this is nice. Fresh air, no hordes of demons trying to kill us - this plane does have its benefits."
Astarion,"So, how are you doing? Your engine isn't giving you any trouble?"
Astarion,"I'm glad you're having a good time, my love. It's a night to be savoured."
Astarion,"I know, you start to forget what peace feels like. Best savour this time while we can."
Astarion,"I doubt tomorrow is on the cards, alas. But we can still enjoy tonight."
Astarion,"How have our friends fared without us? Falling apart, I assume?"
Astarion,"I'm flattered by the attention, darling, but don't you want to check in with some of our erstwhile companions? I'm sure they've missed you."
Astarion,"By the gods, this evening can't end soon enough."
Astarion,"After everything, this feels nice - a chance to take a breath... Metaphorically speaking."
Astarion,"I give you wealth, power, pleasure - every decadence that can be afforded to a person? But you'd rather - what - sleep in the dirt again?"
Astarion,"You are my consort, and I will see you living the very best life. Even if you don't appreciate it."
Astarion,Why don't you go and mingle? Have fun with your so-called friends. I'll be here when you're done.
Astarion,"You'll 'get back' to me? This is important, devil. When?"
Astarion,Sucker.
Astarion,Bless the oblivious.
Astarion,Not even a challenge.
Astarion,"My old - well, a long time ago someone carved infernal runes into my back. They are a fragment of a contract. I'd like to know what the full contract says."
Astarion,"My old - well, a long time ago someone carved some runes into my back. I'd rather like to know what they say."
Astarion,You're coming with me.
Astarion,Do I have to?
Astarion,Let's just go. Standing here chatting gets us nowhere.
Astarion,Let's keep you cute.
Astarion,Then perhaps we should drop by and surprise Raphael? It'd make a nice change. 
Astarion,Well of course they do! They were never anything without us leading them.
Astarion,"I'm amazed they've even survived this long, honestly."
Astarion,"Yes, well, that's to be expected. They never were anything without us."
Astarion,"Well, look who it is!"
Astarion,What are you - no. We are not jumping down there.
Astarion,"So how are you enjoying the Hells, my dear? I assume they're darling as ever?"
Astarion,"Ha! Oh bless you, but no. I am living a life better than most can dream of - I'm not trading these silks for scorched rags."
Astarion,"For you, darling."
Astarion,"Of course, only if you want to."
Astarion,It could be infinitely worse. We seem to be rather good at killing things.
Astarion,"Cazador worked on it from dusk until dawn, all with an ancient blade he called his 'needle'. Cutting and tearing, starting over if I screamed or winced too much."
Astarion,Already done.
Astarion,Really? I'm amazed they're doing as well as that - I was sure every one would be half-dead in the muck.
Astarion,What have you done now?
Astarion,Not that I'll get any thanks...
Astarion,"Yes, fine."
Astarion,Your hero is here.
Astarion,"Yes, yes, I'm coming."
Astarion,What a generous pocket.
Astarion,It was a rough night.
Astarion,Almost too easy.
Astarion,"This is serious business, devil."
Astarion,"My old - well, a long time ago, someone carved infernal runes into my back. They are a fragment of a contract. I'd like to know what the full contract says."
Astarion,"My old - well, a long time ago, someone carved some runes into my back. I'd rather like to know what they say."
Astarion,Gods damn it.
Astarion,Well. Now you know.
Astarion,"I - perhaps I should have. I'm not exactly used to asking for help and being met with, well... help."
Astarion,"But what's done is done, so how about we stop talking about it and just get on with things?"
Astarion,Although I should probably get dressed first...
Astarion,I do. I have a proposal for you.
Astarion,"I'd spend every day waiting for something to go wrong. For the tadpole to find some new trick, reassert itself, and make me a slave again."
Astarion,But trust me - you do want to.
Astarion,A pleasant surprise. 
Astarion,"And you could be so much more, if you want it. One little bite and you could be mine forever."
Astarion,Of course we can. You're the one that I want - the one that I love.
Astarion,"So. What's it to be, darling? Is this it?"
Astarion,It seems I misjudged you. I thought we might have a future together - even an eternity - but perhaps you're not worthy.
Astarion,"To hells with you, I'm done. I hope you rot."
Astarion,Argh! How DARE you!
Astarion,Get away from me - get out of my sight!
Astarion,"How dare you! How could you? I was trying to help you, but you're beyond help. "
Astarion,Gods - NO! ARGH!
Astarion,"It will only hurt a bit, the pleasure will be far greater than the pain."
Astarion,"Own your body, kill your mind."
Astarion,"Tonight, I shall drink every drop of your blood."
Astarion,It won't take me until the end of time to find another like you.
Astarion,You're missing the chance of a lifetime. You will never have another like me.
Astarion,Bad boy.
Astarion,Bad girl.
Astarion,"Hush love, it's all right. You don't have to worry."
Astarion,"A pity, then. We could have had something truly special."
Astarion,I won't forget what you've done for me. I won't leave you to fight this alone.
Astarion,"You came so far, only to slip now. Such a pity."
Astarion,There you are. The real you shows himself at last.
Astarion,I should probably start getting used to the shadows again. Who knows how long I have left in the sun?
Astarion,"Indeed you do. I am so very, very powerful - all thanks to you."
Astarion,"No, you have given me a glorious new future."
Astarion,"Well, what's done is done. And there's simply no point in dwelling on the past, is there?"
Astarion,But don't you want more - don't you want eternity? One more bite is all it would take?
Astarion,You've earned it.
Astarion,"But if you want the gift of eternity, I can give you that. One more bite is all it would take."
Astarion,"What do you mean? Think of the things I can offer you! You're not going to say no to that, surely?"
Astarion,"On your knees, darling."
Astarion,What's not to want? We could be together for all time.
Astarion,I already have everything. Except you by my side.
Astarion,"Without me, you'll need it."
Astarion,"Good luck with the brain, darling."
Astarion,"Until then, you can enjoy my company. You can benefit from my power. But you will not be in my heart."
Astarion,Of course! I'd be disappointed with anything less - you always brought a wonderful sense of fun to the world.
Astarion,"We are bound until the end, you and I. But there will be an end."
Astarion,There you are. The real you shows themselves at last.
Astarion,There you are. The real you shows herself at last.
Astarion,Are you ready to join me? To accept this immortal gift? 
Astarion,"Then come with me, my love, and live your final night."
Astarion,"Not having second thoughts, are we?"
Astarion,Impatient are we? Well who am I to deny you?
Astarion,"It would mean your salvation. Your eternity, despite that thing inside you. "
Astarion,"But if you want the gift of eternity, I can certainly offer you that. One little bite is all it would take."
Astarion,"Oh my sweet, there are no vampires like me. And there never will be again."
Astarion,"Your hands are bloody as mine, darling. Why would you go along with any of this just to pretend you're innocent now?"
Astarion,And now you think you can stand there and tell me how to feel? Because - what? Because you care?
Astarion,"Please, everything is about power. Sex, relationships, violence - they're all just different forms of control."
Astarion,How dare you stand there and judge me. As you know the first thing.
Astarion,Don't you ever compare me to him! Never!
Astarion,"You want to live forever, don't you? To be mine, forever?"
Astarion,Of course if that's not enough - if you need something more - perhaps this isn't for you?
Astarion,Truly? And what was I supposed to learn from this?
Astarion,"Life's a joke, dear, but now we're the ones laughing."
Astarion,Oh don't be such a humourless little wretch - it's nothing but a joke.
Astarion,"So, tell me what you desire. What can I do for my dearest pet? "
Astarion,And one wicked turn deserves another. 
Astarion,"But make no mistake, I will forever remember what you did for me today."
Astarion,"Of course, whatever you need to tell yourself, darling."
Astarion,"You sweet, sweet thing. I want what's best for you too, of course."
Astarion,Who's to say I don't? I'm willing to share all of this with you. What's that if not love?
Astarion,I can't believe you let me do that. Killing all those people.
Astarion,"That's what you want, isn't it? To be mine? Forever?"
Astarion,You wouldn't just be some spawn - you're far more than that to me. 
Astarion,"Shall we have one last night together before you join me in immortality? One for the road, so to speak."
Astarion,"Come, give yourself to me."
Astarion,I have been waiting so long for you. 
Astarion,"I am indomitable, Karlach. Nothing can stop me - least of all your hot-blooded self."
Astarion,"You haven't seen my power, darling. You don't know the things I can do."
Astarion,"Are you ready, my darling?"
Astarion,I knew you'd come around. 
Astarion,"We could be together for eternity, ruling this world side by side. We could have it all."
Astarion,"Karlach, my love. I'm the Vampire Ascendant - there's nothing I can't do."
Astarion,"That's what you've been waiting to hear, isn't it? That's what you want?"
Astarion,"Oh don't be like that, I'd never want to control you. I love you."
Astarion,But we mustn't rush these things. You may need time to adjust.
Astarion,And you will! All in good time.
Astarion,"I will miss this warm flesh, mind you."
Astarion,"I will miss the heat from those scales, though."
Astarion,"I will miss that all-consuming heat of yours, mind."
Astarion,Then it's everything you shall recieve.
Astarion,My dark consort. My right hand. My most beloved spawn.
Astarion,"Oh that was completely different, I'd never hurt you. I love you."
Astarion,Ageing? What do you mean 'ageing'?
Astarion,I'm just glad you're being sensible about this. I was worried you might wake up and grab your torch and pitchfork.
Astarion,"Gods, I never though I'd be so relieved to find a light in the darkness."
Astarion,"I see you, Gale of Waterdeep. I see you."
Astarion,But being willing to turn away from what you know. To turn away from the light and bend the darkness to your will.
Astarion,I lived through the downfall of Sarevok. I'll believe in the rise of Bhaal when I see it.
Astarion,"If the only way to control his possession is to bow to it, I suppose that is how it must be."
Astarion,"Tut tut. We're all friends here, aren't we? "
Astarion,"Ssh, or I'll rush off and tell your Father you've been fibbing. Did he spank you growing up, or go straight for the cat-o'-nine?"
Astarion,Servitude or death. You didn't have a choice.
Astarion,"I won't weep for her, but we could have used her as leverage instead. Sometimes we need to think with our heads before our knives, dear."
Astarion,Watching you make decisions is rather like watching a tarrasque mating ritual. One simply assumes villages will be destroyed in the process.
Astarion,You'll have to go quite a bit further to surprise me.
Astarion,You went after Cazador without me? And why in all the Hells would you do that?
Astarion,"Not just your craftsmanship, although the dead pixies are - 'mwah'."
Astarion,"I do admire how you got that lantern, you know."
Astarion,"Not that I care, it's just that children have a habit of disappearing in this city. Let's not let any more slip away."
Astarion,"If the shapechanger wants Gortash dead, then let's kill Gortash and get Yenna back."
Astarion,"Still, if this means we can take a shot at Ketheric, it may well be worth it."
Astarion,"If you wanted to help, you should have asked me. This is too important for you to handle without me."
Astarion,"Nothing big or terrible, just a small little detail about me that hasn't come up naturally."
Astarion,"Still, you've given us a shot at Ketheric. That's certainly worth a little killing."
Astarion,"Not if I get there first. The game is on, darling."
Astarion,You're going to sit nicely in my lap - perhaps naked - as I give orders to our nocturnal horde from my palace throne. 
Astarion,But that's neither here nor there. What matters is everything's out in the open now. Because we trust each other.
Astarion,"The same something that's kept us from turning into mind flayers, no doubt."
Astarion,"And by rights I should be cinders blowing in the wind, but something's protecting me."
Astarion,So... was there anything else?
Astarion,Right. Well. Glad we got that out of the way.
Astarion,"You know, though I don't look a day over a hundred, I was alive in Baldur's Gate when the Bhaalspawn first arose."
Astarion,I was barely aware of it - locked in the kennels as a young spawn.
Astarion,"Rather thrilling I get to watch the bloodshed first hand. I felt very unfashionable, missing out last time."
Astarion,"Oh, gods, we're going to get into 'Father' this, 'progeny' that all day and night, aren't we?"
Astarion,Ugh. I'm not listening to this. You can worship your Father's emissions in your own head.
Astarion,"Just so you know, I don't judge you for what happened to that bard, Alfira."
Astarion,But the look of guilt on your face was priceless.
Astarion,"I don't care, really. But you could have been more subtle about it."
Astarion,"It seems the Father issues are only just beginning, eh?"
Astarion,The choice is made. You'll never stop killing.
Astarion,A vampire? 
Astarion,It's just that I happen to be a - what's the best way to put this?
Astarion,Bhaal's army will be an unsurpassable dowry. I cannot wait for you to claim it.
Astarion,"But what's done is done. And if he's expecting you to bring me in, maybe we can turn this to our advantage."
Astarion,"So, Shar's chosen walks among us. How lucky we are."
Astarion,"Still, it's done. That's what matters. "
Astarion,"Not yet, but it will become my concern very quickly if a pissed-off god-queen sends a legion of warriors after you."
Astarion,"Unless you're going to lose, in which case I would have to think about it."
Astarion,How could I not fight for such a noble cause?
Astarion,But that's a problem for the future. What are we doing now?
Astarion,I hope you will. For all our sakes.
Astarion,"It's not an issue of 'can', it's an issue of 'must'."
Astarion,I have to face him or I'll never be free.
Astarion,All right. I suppose you've earned a little trust. But only a little.
Astarion,I'll wait. For now. 
Astarion,"I can join you tomorrow? I hardly want to sit in this camp when I could be out there, getting justice."
Astarion,You have a full roster already though. You'll need to leave someone behind.
Astarion,You can't mean that. You want me to sit by the fire while you kill Cazador?
Astarion,"This is my fight, don't you understand? It's not enough that he dies - I need to kill him."
Astarion,"Well of course it's a trap! But now we know it's a trap, and that's half the battle."
Astarion,"Not literally, of course. The actual battle will be long and intense. But at least we have some idea of what we're walking into."
Astarion,You absolutely did not. But sometimes fortune shines on us all the same. 
Astarion,"Very funny. If you're telling me this now, I assume it wasn't enough."
Astarion,"Not that I mind you sticking a thumb in your slaver's eye, I just like to keep track of who wants us dead."
Astarion,I expected Nightsong to be overjoyed after killing her 'fair-haired fool'. 
Astarion,Instead she just seemed... tired.
Astarion,"No... No, I don't think that's it."
Astarion,Maybe it's just hard to see someone else suffer the same thing. It feels unfair - like justice denied.
Astarion,Not what I'd expected. There was a sense of... emptiness.
Astarion,"The blood, the screaming - just thinking about it makes me smile. "
Astarion,"Oh, I felt wonderful! "
Astarion,"Hardly, it's going to be the greatest moment of my life."
Astarion,Especially if you've already cleared a path through the security he'd put in place.
Astarion,"Well, that does make things easier."
Astarion,"He won't throw the doors open for us, he's no fool, but there may be fewer obstacles in our path if he's expecting us."
Astarion,Exactly! I knew I could rely on you. Just like you can rely on me. 
Astarion,Because why would Cazador welcome you into his inner sanctum if his lackeys can kill you and deliver me to him?
Astarion,Our next step is to get me to him.
Astarion,All you have to do is lead me to Cazador. I can handle him once we get there.
Astarion,"You can't be serious. You want me to sit by the fire, twiddling my thumbs, when I could be winning my freedom?"
Astarion,"Even if I agreed to, I can hardly make it to our camp from here. At least for now, you're stuck with me."
Astarion,This is my fight. Don't you understand? I need to do this.
Astarion,Thank you. I won't forget this.
Astarion,Let's do this. Let's go kill the bastard.
Astarion,She probably just needs some time for it to sink in. I'm sure she'll be elated soon.
Astarion,It's simply more efficient than killing you himself.
Astarion,But maybe this isn't so bad. Perhaps it could even work to our advantage.
Astarion,"Hmm. Well, I suppose I can't fault you there."
Astarion,Then that will do.
Astarion,Just that you... have a big heart. You like doing what's right.
Astarion,"So I was thinking, what would be the right thing to do when we get to Moonrise Towers? When we come face-to-face with whoever is controlling the parasites in our heads."
Astarion,"Gods... No, try to think outside the box. Just a little."
Astarion,Consider the parasites in our skulls and think - how many others have the mind flayers infected? Hundreds? Thousands?
Astarion,"That's the obvious option, yes, but consider the alternatives."
Astarion,"Yes, exactly!"
Astarion,"Just think, how many people have the mind flayers infected? Hundreds? Thousands?"
Astarion,"Power is just a tool, it's people that are good or evil."
Astarion,And even they can be a little bit...
Astarion,"I'm just saying there's an opportunity here. If we can control the tadpoles, we can keep ourselves safe and liberate the world from this evil."
Astarion,So much for thinking you had ambition.
Astarion,"Well, no, I was being generous. But you're not beyond hope."
Astarion,"You look rabid, pained, sick."
Astarion,You are spasming and twitching... You poor thing.
Astarion,"Hmmm... So far my tadpole and I have been nothing but best friends. Something else is happening to you, isn't it?"
Astarion,"You have bouts of swooning and swaying, and your jaw is grinding like you're poised to chew off your tongue."
Astarion,Do take care of yourself.
Astarion,"You might be a little naive in the ways of the world, but I see promise in you. Ambition."
Astarion,The norm is to keep dirty thoughts like that to ourselves. But do carry on.
Astarion,How could I not? We are both veritable terrors on society.
Astarion,"Look, I'm not a 'details' person, all right? But turning up and causing chaos has worked for us so far. "
Astarion,I just worry that we're not considering all our options when it comes to our uninvited guests.
Astarion,"How many people are infected with them, do you think? Hundreds? Thousands?"
Astarion,And they're not just goblin trash - there are powerful people in the worms' thrall.
Astarion,At least the bits of it that are worth saving.
Astarion,"Whoever's waiting for us at Moonrise Towers controls it all. But if we can take that control from them, imagine the power we'd wield."
Astarion,"Isn't it? Imagine, the entire cult under our thumb."
Astarion,"I'm just saying there's an opportunity before us. If we can control the tadpoles, we can keep ourselves safe and enjoy a little world domination on the side."
Astarion,You can't tell me that doesn't sound fun.
Astarion,"I can't talk when we have a city to save, darling."
Astarion,I knew I was right about you. It's so good to find a kindred spirit.
Astarion,"Of course, this all assumes we live long enough to find this 'Moonrise'. But I'm feeling optimistic."
Astarion,"I always dreamed of walking these halls, you know - enjoying the luxury of the ducal palace. And look at it now."
Astarion,"You know, I've been thinking. And I think there's something I should tell you."
Astarion,But you can trust me. Of course you can - we're a team!
Astarion,Do. It's not often the universe hands you something like this - we'd be fools to squander it. 
Astarion,"A pity, I thought you had more ambition than that."
Astarion,"Still, we're not there yet. Maybe you'll see the light yet."
Astarion,"That's just the thing - if we control the parasites, then we can order them not to change us. All the power with none of the tentacles."
Astarion,It seems you have been dealt a vile hand... I say: play it. Play it for all it's worth.
Astarion,Nobody should deny themselves of their true nature.
Astarion,"Bhaal himself has sentenced you to an eternity of madness, to be consumed by your Urge."
Astarion,"The Urges are calling on you again, aren't they? I haven't seen you sleep through the night once in the past days."
Astarion,Probably more Baldurian parents scare their children with stories of your kind than mine.
Astarion,"I thought your kind was extinct. Goes to show, you should always check your facts."
Astarion,So... how are you feeling? Keen to reconnect with your family? Or ready to throw yourself in an oubliette?
Astarion,"You know, I didn't realise you and I were so alike."
Astarion,"Things haven't really changed - I'm still the same sweet, loveable rogue. My smile is just a little... sharper."
Astarion,I - I felt paralysed to do anything about Cazador for so many decades.
Astarion,I gave up on myself. I gave up on any hope of escape after a few lashes.
Astarion,Bhaal controls you in much the same way.
Astarion,The half-life of a mind-addled slave is worse than death - don't become his. I wouldn't live another century as one for all the moonstones in Evereska.
Astarion,"And later, when that worm is bursting out of your face and you're trying to scream through your tentacles, remember that you chose this."
Astarion,"Fine, I'll go. But do me one favour: remember this moment."
Astarion,I'll be good. I promise.
Astarion,"I shall be the very model of virtue, cross my heart and hope to - ...uh."
Astarion,"And if nothing else, think of what's ahead. We need each other if we're going to survive this."
Astarion,Did our night together mean nothing to you?
Astarion,"Oh come on, don't be like that."
Astarion,"Oh don't bother, not on my account, anyway. Let it roam free. You make quite the pretty pitfiend."
Astarion,"Erm, yes. It does smell the part."
Astarion,Just make sure those claws don't come anywhere near me.
Astarion,The beast you turn into... as charming as it is...
Astarion,"You'll never be free, will you? He is going to take over..."
Astarion,"I've had periods where I was so hungry, I was all but robbed of speech and reason."
Astarion,"If you become as I fear... feral, scrabbling, all but a carrion-creature... I don't think I'll be able to look at you. It will remind me too much of my worst self."
Astarion,"If that is to be your fate, I will enjoy our time together while it lasts. But soon enough we'll have to say our goodbyes."
Astarion,"In a thousand years, when I've all but forgotten how to love yet again, you'll flit back into my heart, and I'll weep wondering what happened to my mad love."
Astarion,Good morning! Thank you for not killing me the other night.
Astarion,"Are you all right now, or is today a 'I will wed you with a delicate veil of blood blooming over your white curls' kind of day?"
Astarion,"You give me something to care for, and that's worth the peril."
Astarion,"Trust I don't want to be torn apart and reborn a mind flayer, then. Because this arrangement is my best chance to avoid that."
Astarion,"Excellent. You will let me know the next time you need to be tied up, won't you?"
Astarion,At least the smut-peddlers of Sharess' Caress will have a field day writing erotic verse about us when we're both dead.
Astarion,Well done again on besting Bhaal and all that. It was very twee.
Astarion,"I knew you had that sweet heart all along. I was alarmed by you sometimes, scandalised even, but somehow by your side, I still only ever saw you."
Astarion,I have the utmost confidence you would do the same for me.
Astarion,Now excuse me while I go and regurgitate the sap rankling in my throat.
Astarion,The occasional night of passion aside.
Astarion,"Well, we've made it this far without anyone sinking their teeth into anyone else."
Astarion,Dying and being reborn is never pleasant.
Astarion,"Just as the lick of poison is removed from my words of love, yours become a sentence of death. A tragic pair, eh?"
Astarion,Just think - how many others are walking around infected with these parasites? Hundreds? Thousands?
Astarion,"Darling, I was just thinking about you. "
Astarion,"I'm growing to like the whole package, honestly. And you clearly like me too, so..."
Astarion,"It could be either, both, or something else entirely. "
Astarion,"Whatever this place is, he kept it secret for a reason. And his secrets always had a sting to them."
Astarion,Now we just need to see what lies at the heart of this place.
Astarion,"I don't know, it feels older than that. Who knows how old..."
Astarion,But Cazador will want a grand space for his Ascension. A venue like this feels perfect.
Astarion,Of course not - it's not like he boasted about his secret lift.
Astarion,But it does make sense. He'd want somewhere grand for his Ascension. This seems perfect.
Astarion,Just keep your eyes open. We could find anything down here.
Astarion,Well? You clearly want to say something.
Astarion,"I'm not sure, I've been weighing my options. "
Astarion,"On the one hand, they're the key to my unlocking eternal power and freedom. On the other... "
Astarion,Well. It's my fault they're here.
Astarion,"Yes, it was Cazador's command, I had no choice. But..."
Astarion,It seems now I do.
Astarion,And what am I owed? What about the injustices I've suffered - am I not entitled to anything?
Astarion,"All that matters now is killing Cazador. I've earned that, if nothing else."
Astarion,"We can deal with the prisoners when the time is right. After all, they're not going anywhere."
Astarion,"This is all so grand. To think it was just sitting here, lurking under the floor."
Astarion,That will very much depend on what happens once I face Cazador.
Astarion,Cazador's healing in his coffin. This is the moment - he's mine. 
Astarion,Not now! Not when Cazador's finally mine.
Astarion,Even if you've damned yourself to a lifetime of that same pain.
Astarion,"Pain can break anyone, but she bore it well and got what she wanted."
Astarion,"Pain can break anyone, but you bore it well and got what you wanted."
Astarion,Credit where it's due: Shadowheart is tenacious. And tougher than I expected.
Astarion,Credit where it's due: you are tenacious. And tougher than I expected.
Astarion,I really thought Shadowheart and Lae'zel might fight to the death over that artefact.
Astarion,"Unless she chose it herself. Which is even more worrying, honestly."
Astarion,"I'm sure her parents meant well, but the name's a little ominous isn't it?"
Astarion,Shadowheart. Shadow Heart...
Astarion,"We probably should save the druid, though. He does have his uses."
Astarion,"One the one hand, killing Gortash would be fun. On the other, Halsin can be very annoying."
Astarion,"So, we kill Gortash or Halsin dies? It's not an easy call."
Astarion,"Really? Well, if you're sure..."
Astarion,I don't care what you do with them - we all have our secrets - just don't empty my pack to feed whatever it is you have going on. 
Astarion,"No, this has to happen. Here and now."
Astarion,"Also, there's the small matter of all that power I can steal from the bastard. So that'll be nice."
Astarion,Then ask. Quickly.
Astarion,"Hurry, to his coffin! It's time to end this."
Astarion,"Yes, but I'd rather not lose any more valuable artefacts, if it's all the same to you."
Astarion,"Just try not to consume anything too expensive or powerful. You may need magic, but I need coin. "
Astarion,I suppose we can spare the occasional trinket if it stops you from killing us all.
Astarion,I don't care what he's offering - I wouldn't have been so quick to sign with the devil.
Astarion,Excuse me - I'm sorry for looking out for our collective hides.
Astarion,I'm sure I will. Whatever the hells that might be. 
Astarion,"I hope so, otherwise we may all be killed in our beds."
Astarion,"But fine, take her if you wish. Just know I'll be resting with one eye open."
Astarion,"Not again, at any rate."
Astarion,Excuse me? I would never.
Astarion,"I want to be clear - letting Minthara tag along with us was your idea. So if you wake up with a dagger to your throat, that's on you."
Astarion,"Inconceivable as it might be, I actually didn't ask you. "
Astarion,"Now, what do you want, exactly?"
Astarion,"Hmm? Oh - yes, your trademark wit."
Astarion,I... I don't know. I thought they were dead for so long.
Astarion,"I could feel guilty, happy in the knowledge there was nothing I could have done differently. I could never have saved them."
Astarion,But now... now there's a choice to make.
Astarion,That is a complicated question. I was so sure they were dead.
Astarion,"'Alive'? No. But animated? Yes, I'm sure they are."
Astarion,"If Cazador turned the victims we brought him to spawn, he'll have done the same to the children. With glee, I imagine."
Astarion,"Then again, it's not my name on the page, so what should I care?"
Astarion,Still considering our options?
Astarion,It seems to me like there's a clear path forward. Karlach just has to walk it.
Astarion,"So, we owe our continued survival to a rebel squid and a prisoner prince."
Astarion,You're serious. Gods above...
Astarion,"I was sure I saw you with one of our more magical, and more valuable, items earlier. Any idea where it is now?"
Astarion,"So, Shadowheart stood up to the Dark Lady? I'm almost impressed."
Astarion,"So, you stood up to the Dark Lady? I'm almost impressed."
Astarion,Or to see so many Harpers clanking about.
Astarion,"But I have to find him before I can face him. So let's focus on that, shall we?"
Astarion,At least there's no permanent damage done. Or not too much permanent damage? I suppose time will tell.
Astarion,This is what happens when you trust the gith: they strap you to a machine and try to kill you.
Astarion,Even if she's damned herself to a lifetime of that same pain.
Astarion,"I'm sorry, but this is what happens when we trust your people: they strap you to a machine and try to kill you."
Astarion,So much for the cavalry riding to our rescue.
Astarion,"Still, I don't like being under anyone's thumb. The sooner we can turn the tables and start pulling their strings, the better. "
Astarion,And our cranial guests already came with some advantages - maybe there're more to uncover.
Astarion,I suppose that is a point.
Astarion,"It is better than sprouting tentacles, I'll give you that."
Astarion,"And who knows, they might even have some new tricks to reveal?"
Astarion,"Well - hold on, I didn't say that. The parasites still have their advantages. "
Astarion,I almost preferred it when we were worried we might transform at any moment.
Astarion,"This is what we get for putting our faith in a network of spies, I suppose."
Astarion,"Remembering our time together, the things we've shared - and I don't just mean that lovely neck of yours."
Astarion,I'm still thinking about Karlach. About what she said.
Astarion,Won't be long now. They'll pay for what they did to me.
Astarion,"Deny your feelings all you like, it doesn't matter to me."
Astarion,"I've already tasted you, and that's all the carnal delight I need. "
Astarion,I can face anything now. Let's get back to the hunt.
Astarion,Let's just go. I'm done.
Astarion,So this is it. I'm home.
Astarion,"There's the same fading carpet, the same tasteless art..."
Astarion,"Nothing's changed, but gods, everything feels different."
Astarion,"We have everything we need to open the ballroom door, so let's not waste time talking."
Astarion,"Cazador's hiding somewhere behind that door, and I'm going to find him."
Astarion,Two centuries walking these halls and I've never once seen the ballroom door locked.
Astarion,Cazador doesn't want anything going wrong tonight.
Astarion,"Cazador's skulking somewhere beneath us, in this 'defiled chapel' the others mentioned."
Astarion,We just have to find the entrance. Then he'll be mine.
Astarion,"Cazador's nearby, I can feel it. He'll have some secret room or tunnel, I'm sure of it."
Astarion,Hmm?
Astarion,Keep your voice down. 
Astarion,Quietly. Anyone could be listening.
Astarion,Ha! Maybe there's more to you than I thought.
Astarion,"It does feel strange, breaking into your own home. Especially if murder's on your mind."
Astarion,"Come now, don't be coy. Your body's already given you away."
Astarion,Then let me make it up to you. You gave me a wonderful gift - it's only fair I return the favour.
Astarion,I could feel it as I was getting lost in your neck. Your little shakes of excitement.
Astarion,"You enjoyed it, didn't you?"
Astarion,You don't have to say a thing - I already know how you feel. Because I feel it too.
Astarion,So did I. More than words can say.
Astarion,You deserve a reward. I am so very pleased with what you gave me.
Astarion,We could take an evening to ourselves. Get away from camp - get some privacy.
Astarion,I know somewhere quiet. Somewhere intimate. Somewhere we can... indulge in each other.
Astarion,Wonderful. I just hope we don't have to wait too long before we can steal away.
Astarion,"But once we can, I promise you a night you'll never forget."
Astarion,"See you there, lover."
Astarion,"Thank goodness we're all such good, trusting friends, then."
Astarion,"On my honour, the only thing on my mind is depraved, carnal lust."
Astarion,Oh you are no fun at all.
Astarion,"Oh, that's hardly the only reason. It's more of an excuse if anything."
Astarion,"Assuming you want this too, of course. But we both know you do."
Astarion,"And look how well it worked! I've never felt better, all thanks to you. "
Astarion,So let me repay you for your noble sacrifice.
Astarion,What? Was it something I said?
Astarion,"Then again, this is hardly the strangest thing we've done together."
Astarion,Although it could be the most satisfying.
Astarion,"Well, the second most satisfying..."
Astarion,"I'm surprised, you have more steel than I thought."
Astarion,"The signet ring should unlock the ballroom door, but only if we can read the inscription."
Astarion,"And I don't know about you, but it's pure gibberish to me."
Astarion,"We need to unlock the ballroom door, which we can't do without a key."
Astarion,"Our dear kennelmaster Godey will be lurking downstairs with one. I doubt he'll want to share, though. "
Astarion,"Well, I was thinking first we find Cazador. And then we kill Cazador."
Astarion,"I could tell Shadowheart was tough, but a killer?"
Astarion,"I knew you were tough, but a killer?"
Astarion,Hardly a fitting ending. But so few are.
Astarion,"So, that's how the legend ends. The Blade of Frontiers, cast down to the Hells."
Astarion,I hope you don't come to regret it.
Astarion,"So, you chose your family over your god. "
Astarion,"That's about it, really. We can workshop the details as we go."
Astarion,"Oh, I've never been less sure of anything. But if I don't face him now, I never will."
Astarion,"I'll spend the rest of my life running, watching the shadows, never feeling safe."
Astarion,"I can't say I would have made the same call, but each to their own."
Astarion,"So, you've agreed to be a good boy and hand the Crown over to Mystra?"
Astarion,"I'm surprised, she has more steel than I thought."
Astarion,"You know, I never dreamed our noble Jaheira would be such a terrible, terrible mother."
Astarion,It's nice to see heroes are as awful as the rest of us.
Astarion,"Our old kennelmaster Godey will have a key, but the writing? I've no idea how to read that."
Astarion,"Oh no, it's much worse than that. "
Astarion,"They're fanatics, here of their own free will and utterly devoted to Cazador."
Astarion,Each one came to our door and begged to be given his 'eternal gift'. They're sure he'll turn them if they serve him well enough. 
Astarion,"You'd almost feel sorry for the poor, deluded souls. "
Astarion,Though it's not over yet. Masters rarely let their slaves go without a fight.
Astarion,"It took a little time, but she got there."
Astarion,"It took a little time, but you got there."
Astarion,"So, Lae'zel's finally seen the light and turned on her mistress."
Astarion,Gods. There really is no justice in the world.
Astarion,"So, Lae'zel's finally seen the light and turned on your mistress."
Astarion,"But they're idiots who brought this on themselves, so... don't."
Astarion,He's Cazador's skeletal right hand - he kept us in line when 'master' didn't feel like torturing us himself.
Astarion,"If Cazador was going to trust anyone to lock the doors behind him, it'd be that rattling old carcass."
Astarion,"Godey kept us in kennels downstairs. The master ruled everywhere else, but they were his domain."
Astarion,"If my dear siblings were right, Cazador's hiding somewhere below the palace."
Astarion,"After so many years, I would have spotted any secret tunnels out here."
Astarion,"The only place that was off-limits to us was his study. If the entrance is anywhere, it'll be there - through the ballroom."
Astarion,"If Cazador's hiding anywhere, it'll be behind the huge, locked doors covered in secret writing."
Astarion,"So, you finally saw the light and turned on your mistress."
Astarion,We both want to survive. But why merely survive when you can thrive?
Astarion,And that you're a cold-blooded killer. Which I respect. 
Astarion,The way you dealt with the refugee situation showed you can make the choices that need to be made.
Astarion,"I can't say for sure, but we've come through a lot already. It would hardly do to fail now."
Astarion,"Please, darling, you have the Vampire Ascendant on your side. How could we lose?"
Astarion,"I can't say. All I know is that by transforming, you've given us our best possible chance to survive this."
Astarion,"But of course! With my power and your tentacles, how could we lose?"
Astarion,"Oh, as well as can be expected when facing down the end of the world."
Astarion,"Aside from my once-beautiful lover turning into a monster? Oh, wonderful."
Astarion,"I admit, I did love the person you were, but I understand why you made this choice."
Astarion,It's certainly... different. It will take some getting used to.
Astarion,"I do miss your pretty face, though."
Astarion,"I admit, I'm a little torn. You are repulsive, but just think of all the power you can access. It's a compelling mixture in an ally."
Astarion,"We'd better survive this, because I never want to stop doing that."
Astarion,"You've never tasted so sweet, darling."
Astarion,Then we'd better make it count.
Astarion,"No offence, but... I mean, how would that even work now?"
Astarion,"Oh - actually, I think the last time we kissed was our last chance to share a kiss."
Astarion,"No, our kissing days are done, so let's focus on defeating the brain. Otherwise this whole mess will have been for nothing."
Astarion,"Ha! Oh, my love. You can't expect me to kiss that now, can you? "
Astarion,"I always dreamed of walking these halls, you know."
Astarion,"Come on, my love. Let's show them what we can do. "
Astarion,"My dreams never included a giant brain or smouldering ruins, but I'll take what I can get."
Astarion,Maybe I should help fund the repairs when this is all over. It would be the civic-minded thing to do.
Astarion,You flirt. But I have other business.
Astarion,And you - keep your distance. No need for this to get messy.
Astarion,Shh. Not a sound. Not if you want to keep that darling neck of yours.
Astarion,"You can try, but first you'll tell me what you know."
Astarion,I just need information. I saw you scuttling about on the ship. 
Astarion,"You're in league with them, aren't you? Those tentacled - argh."
Astarion,"Don't we? I saw you on the ship - free, scuttling about."
Astarion,"There, can you see it?"
Astarion,"There, in the grass. You can kill it, can't you? Like you killed the others."
Astarion,"Hurry, I've got one of those brain things cornered."
Astarion,This gets better and better.
Astarion,I can just walk into homes now?
Astarion,I'll solve this damn thing myself. You can rot.
Astarion,And to think I actually cared about you. Ridiculous.
Astarion,"Whatever we might have had, it's over."
Astarion,That is it! I've dragged your sorry carcass far enough.
Astarion,"And it means we could install secret tunnels, spy holes, maybe even a murder pit. Everything we'd need to rule from the shadows."
Astarion,Look at this place. From a symbol of the city's power and grandeur to a brain-infested husk.
Astarion,"Just think of it as motivation to survive. Because if we find a way to overcome this, we can find a way to overcome those spicy lips of yours. "
Astarion,"You'd just better survive this, because when it's done, we are going to find a way to taste each other."
Astarion,"As do I. After all, forbidden fruit always tastes the sweetest."
Astarion,"You're asking me? Oh, darling, I don't know - flip a coin if you need to."
Astarion,"A bold move. It's a gamble, but if we play this right, it could work well for us."
Astarion,All right... Let's see how this plays out.
Astarion,That is a risky move. But if you think it's the right one...
Astarion,"That narrows our choices a little, but all right. What will you allow?"
Astarion,I trust you with it. I just hope you know what you're doing.
Astarion,"But if you won't let Karlach do it, then the final decision is in your hands."
Astarion,I won't argue with you. She's scary enough as a tiefling - I hate to think what kind of mind flayer she'd make.
Astarion,I understand. It makes sense.
Astarion,"All right. If we're going to do this, then let's do this."
Astarion,"I don't think it's a good option, mind you. But we are all out of good options."
Astarion,Of course you're not. When have you ever been afraid of anything?
Astarion,"Really? Gods, all right. Better you than me."
Astarion,"I wish I was surprised you'd volunteer, but I'm not. It's so perfectly... you."
Astarion,Of course you will. And of course you're not.
Astarion,"We'll figure something else out, I - I'm sure of it."
Astarion,I'm going to assume you meant that as a joke. I do not want you to transform into some slimy beast.
Astarion,"If you won't allow the gith to suffer, then let Karlach do it. She's doomed anyway, so why not?"
Astarion,"Personally, I'd let Karlach do it if she's so keen. She's doomed anyway, so why not?"
Astarion,"Just don't you consider transforming. The tentacles won't suit you at all, darling."
Astarion,"If you won't allow the gith to suffer, then I'll just have to trust you'll make the right decision."
Astarion,"Anything on your mind? Impending doom, perhaps?"
Astarion,And? Anything to say before the end of the world?
Astarion,Let's be quick - our metaphorical clock is ticking.
Astarion,"Hardly an ideal place to chat, but I'll allow it."
Astarion,You always pick the most romantic spots to chat.
Astarion,"Yes, darling? Something to say before the end of the world?"
Astarion,"All right, we can do this. We have to do this."
Astarion,"Alas, you don't have any easy options."
Astarion,"Promises, promises. But I have other business, I'm afraid."
Astarion,"But whatever you decide, I'm sure it'll be the right call."
Astarion,"Personally, I'd use the Hammer and take our chances with Orpheus. I'm most willing to lose him."
Astarion,"But if Orpheus is off the table... well, I trust you to think of something. "
Astarion,"I hate to say it, but if Karlach wants to do this, perhaps you should let her?"
Astarion,I'm fine with anything that keeps you from transforming into a mind flayer.
Astarion,I'm fine with anything that keeps you from transforming any further.
Astarion,"However it lands, I'm sure you'll make the right choice."
Astarion,"Personally, I'd use the Hammer. Let Orpheus take the fall - what is he to us?"
Astarion,"Personally, I'd use the Hammer. Let Orpheus take the fall - your people have been fine without him all these years."
Astarion,Although I understand if you feel differently about your 'prince'.
Astarion,Maybe we should hand the stones over to the Emperor.
Astarion,"And I'll eat your heart, fire girl."
Astarion,And your friend with me? Hardly.
Astarion,Argh! You son of a -
Astarion,You wriggling little - agh.
Astarion,"I'm not here for games, you little - agh!"
Astarion,Ah! Damn it!
Astarion,"I'm half tempted to spill your guts all over the dirt anyway, but for now - apologies."
Astarion,"You're not one of them. They took you, same as they took me."
Astarion,It sounds like you saw a glimpse of my past. And I saw yours.
Astarion,"Stupid. I saw into your head, you know."
Astarion,"Yes. Yes, that has to be it. "
Astarion,"Now, tell me what just happened! What was that?"
Astarion,"A fine effort, but I've seen it all. I was walking this land while your ancestors were learning to crawl."
Astarion,"I saw into your mind. They took you, just the same as me."
Astarion,How about I keep the knife and you tell me what you know anyway?
Astarion,No words of wisdom before you go?
Astarion,"And you. If we meet again, I hope we're still wearing the right skins."
Astarion,"Well yes, of course. But first things first."
Astarion,Then finding anyone who might know about these worms. I need an expert. Someone who knows how to control these things...
Astarion,Argh! You wretched little -
Astarion,"Well, getting out of here, for a start. "
Astarion,"The worm, of course. That explains things. Somewhat."
Astarion,It's those tentacled monsters. Whatever they did - whatever they put in us - just created a connection.
Astarion,"It seems we were both passengers on that damned ship. I suppose that merits an introduction, if nothing else."
Astarion,"Well hello. It's nice to see some people are willing to talk, rather than attacking you on sight."
Astarion,At least someone had the good grace to bring me back. I suppose that merits an introduction.
Astarion,I - I died. They killed me!
Astarion,You again? I hope we won't repeat the previous unpleasantness.
Astarion,How about we try words instead of blades? It's safer for everyone.
Astarion,"First you kill me, then you bring me back? You make quite the first impression."
Astarion,"All right, we'll do this the old-fashioned way."
Astarion,"Shh, not a word. Let's try to keep that lovely neck of yours in one piece, hmm?"
Astarion,You arrogant little - argh.
Astarion,You'll talk. I can - argh.
Astarion,I'm not an idiot. I saw - argh.
Astarion,What did you and those tentacled freaks do to me?
Astarion,"I saw you on the ship, strutting about while I was trapped in that pod."
Astarion,"I was so hoping for a kind soul. Well, not to worry."
Astarion,They took you too. I saw it during... whatever just happened.
Astarion,I'm not an idiot. It has to be those tentacled monsters. Something they did...
Astarion,It's those tentacled monsters. Whatever they did to us caused that link.
Astarion,These worms are already affecting me. I can feel it. Now what to do about it...
Astarion,I suppose it's not exactly common knowledge.
Astarion,"No, of that much we can be certain."
Astarion,"So, did you learn anything about these worms while wandering the ship?"
Astarion,"My my, you've been busy. "
Astarion,So do you know anything about these worms?
Astarion,A pleasure.
Astarion,Is that so? We clearly move in different circles.
Astarion,My name's Astarion. I was in Baldur's Gate when those beasts snatched me.
Astarion,"I'm out of wine and flowers, so I hope an introduction will suffice."
Astarion,"Indeed we are. Please, allow me to introduce myself."
Astarion,"Ah, a kindred spirit."
Astarion,And to think I was ready to decorate the ground with your innards. Apologies.
Astarion,"You're not one of them. They took you, just the same as me."
Astarion,What was that? What's going on?
Astarion,"Don't play dumb, you little - agh!"
Astarion,Don't lie to me! I - agh.
Astarion,And now you're going to tell me exactly what you and those tentacled freaks did to me.
Astarion,Splendid.
Astarion,"Now, I saw you on the ship, didn't I? Nod."
Astarion,The strong and silent type? All right.
Astarion,Please tell me you at least know something about these worms.
Astarion,Turn us into - ha. Hahaha!
Astarion,Of course it'll turn me into a monster. What else did I expect?
Astarion,Funny. 
Astarion,"Well, maybe I'll see you again. Still wearing the same skin, I hope. "
Astarion,Of course. I'll make my own way.
Astarion,"Good luck, I suppose. Here's hoping we're still wearing the same skins when we next meet."
Astarion,I need to find out more before I let anyone root around in my skull. I'll find an expert.
Astarion,These worms are doing something - I can feel it. What are you going to do about it?
Astarion,"Wait, that's it? 'You're doomed, sorry', and then off to the next adventure?"
Astarion,And you seem like a useful person to know.
Astarion,Answer a few little questions and we won't have to find out.
Astarion,"All right, I accept. Lead on."
Astarion,"You know, I was ready to go this alone, but maybe sticking with the herd isn't such a bad idea."
Astarion,Good luck.
Astarion,"And I hate to turn down an invitation. All right, maybe I'll see you there."
Astarion,"I was ready to go this alone, but maybe sticking with the herd isn't a bad idea. Safety in numbers, after all."
Astarion,"Tempting, but your party seems a little crowded right now. I like to have my space."
Astarion,"But if the leader of your little band wants to talk, I'd be happy to hear it."
Astarion,"Forgive me, but are you really in a position to invite people along?"
Astarion,Although it hasn't happened yet. If we can find an expert - someone that can control these things - there might still be time.
Astarion,And anyone that can crash a mind flayer ship and walk away seems like a good person to know.
Astarion,We could free the gith prince with the Orphic Hammer. Perhaps he'll have a bright idea.
Astarion,We could free your prince with the Orphic Hammer. Perhaps he'll have a bright idea.
Astarion,"Karlach has offered herself. I can't say I love the idea, but... well, there is a cruel logic to it."
Astarion,"Assuming we don't turn into mind flayers, of course. That might put a bit of a damper on things."
Astarion,"The point is, I'm looking forward. Focusing on what's important for our future."
Astarion,"Exactly! So, was there anything else?"
Astarion,"Spite made me who I am. Now let sleeping dogs lie, lest you get bitten."
Astarion,"Oh please, you think I'm the only one with secrets? At least you know there's something I'm not telling you."
Astarion,Trust me to do what's best for me - our fates are linked. I need you and you need me. It's that simple.
Astarion,And right now what's best for me is some quiet. Until later.
Astarion,Well? Ask.
Astarion,I suppose you want to hear about Cazador.
Astarion,"I don't want to say a damned thing, but that won't do anyone any good. "
Astarion,Not political power or military power - I mean power over people. The power to control them completely.
Astarion,"Not him, no. A gang of thugs attacked me, angry about a ruling that I'd handed down as magistrate."
Astarion,A vampire's spawn is less than a slave. They're a puppet.
Astarion,We have no choice but to obey our masters' commands. They speak and our bodies react - it's all part of the deal.
Astarion,Sometimes he'd order us to submit to torture. Sometimes he'd have us torture ourselves. Whatever his weathervane mood settled on.
Astarion,He had me go out into Baldur's Gate to fetch him the most beautiful souls I could find. 
Astarion,"It was a fun little ritual of his - I'd bring them back and he'd ask if I wanted to dine with him. And if I said yes, he'd serve me a dead, putrid rat."
Astarion,"And curious you'll remain. The past is dead, I'm not about to exhume it when there's a nice, bright future ahead of me."
Astarion,"Of course if I said no, he'd have me flayed. Hard to say which was worse."
Astarion,"No, I don't. The past is dead, so why exhume it when we have a nice, bright future ahead of us?"
Astarion,Was it? I see...
Astarion,"I had nothing at all for so long. Not even my body - that was owned by Cazador, to be sent out to tempt fools into his palace."
Astarion,I have bedded thousands of people. Half of them I barely remember. Most of them didn't even grant me temporary bliss.
Astarion,I can stop using myself. Stop being used.
Astarion,"It isn't worth the scars, anymore."
Astarion,"Well... perhaps I should see it that way, after all. "
Astarion,It isn't humiliating to use myself as a weapon. It's degrading that people like her fall for it. Over and over again.
Astarion,Charm is just another spell we cast.
Astarion,Enjoyment? That didn't come into it. I never had a choice.
Astarion,I could have lived eternally in Cazador's pleasure chambers. I'm not afraid to die. I'm afraid I'll never have a new life after that.
Astarion,Why? I'm simply trying to be realistic.
Astarion,"No, it isn't. Even if I'm free, I can't escape my body, and the truths about it I know:"
Astarion,"Next time, I won't be so stroppy. No point not using all the assets the gods give us."
Astarion,All the promiscuous jibes paint a picture of someone who would relish the deed... You couldn't really have known.
Astarion,I forced myself to do it.
Astarion,I thought it would be nothing at all to sell myself to that drow's fantasies. But the price was higher than I imagined. I don't want to do it again.
Astarion,"Ugh, I suppose I'll forget it, in time. I always do."
Astarion,I'll drink that potion and never think about it again afterwards. But what I had to do to get it is going to stay...
Astarion,I hope you're not here to ask about Cazador.
Astarion,"Thank you, but this isn't about sympathy. It's about knowing what we might be up against."
Astarion,The mind flayers aren't the only monsters out there. They're not even the only ones hunting us.
Astarion,All I'm asking is that you keep your eyes open. And watch out for anything lurking in the shadows.
Astarion,"You're too adorable. I'll be fine. I'm sure they'll bring back memories of so many pathetic years, but I'm much stronger now."
Astarion,"If we don't find my brethren, they will find us. Likely with bared fangs."
Astarion,"We should get to them first, then we can make their pretty tongues talk."
Astarion,"My, my. You sweetheart. Then there isn't a moment to waste."
Astarion,"We'll be glorious both, you and I. You'll have your day, too."
Astarion,And we are no closer to knowing why that bastard is so obsessed with getting me back.
Astarion,"I think we should track down my fellow spawn. I'm not exactly looking forward to a reunion, but perhaps they'll know something."
Astarion,"If we find them, we can force them to tell us what he's been doing since I was gone."
Astarion,"And, honestly, I imagine they'll be coming for me in the night if I don't."
Astarion,"Unless Cazador has changed their orders, they'll be in the dens of this town, seeking prey."
Astarion,"Oh, they'll be here for you, too. "
Astarion,"I know, I'm a real delight. But we're in danger, and we will have to face the other spawn at some point."
Astarion,"Who was the one who thwarted the deal with Raphael, hmm?"
Astarion,"To tell you the truth, I don't know whether we can defeat Cazador. Not unless we figure out more about what he's plotting."
Astarion,The Gate is close... as is Cazador.
Astarion,"You know, I feel a connection between us. Like we're two souls walking the same path."
Astarion,"I would keep the murders in our own camp to a minimum, but otherwise we're very much on the same page."
Astarion,Let's find out more about the ritual before we waltz into Cazador's front door.
Astarion,"All I'm saying is: let's be clever about it. If an opportunity arises for me to become a more magnificent bastard than I already am, why turn it down?"
Astarion,"I know you do. It matters to me, as well. I want to be able to protect you, too."
Astarion,Doesn't it sound delightful? For the lucky little vampire on the winning side?
Astarion,"What more could I ask? Now, is that all?"
Astarion,"If you think they'll take me and spare you, you haven't been listening."
Astarion,But at least we know where we all stand.
Astarion,The mind flayers aren't the only monsters out there. And they might not be the only ones hunting us.
Astarion,"I will, but I won't take it for granted."
Astarion,My point is simple...
Astarion,Oh? And what might that be?
Astarion,Oh? Then what do you want?
Astarion,But... a part of me feels sick when I think about getting on my back for breadcrumbs again.
Astarion,"Now that you know what I am, I should tell you that Cazador was more than just a slaver."
Astarion,"Cazador and his Rite of Profane Ascension. An imperious soiree, attended by devils and spawn alike..."
Astarion,"A grand ceremony to honour one exalted vampiric master, and elevate him to an unfathomable station."
Astarion,To place him in a position of such esteem the world will yearn to kneel and offer their necks.
Astarion,Of course I envy him. Why wouldn't I?
Astarion,Then you've been thinking the same thing.
Astarion,"We will kill him, but there's more to it. Think about it. It sounds like Cazador, for all his evils, has gotten further than any of my kind ever have. He's on the verge of a miracle."
Astarion,"If the time comes, and I can stay one move ahead of him, I'll take his place before his blood can hit the floor."
Astarion,"What's a handful of the wretch's servants? If they're anything like me when I was enslaved, they're all but begging for death anyway."
Astarion,Baldur's Gate is right over the hills. And so is Cazador...
Astarion,"Honestly, I was expecting an all-powerful brain to have a lair that was a little flashier. Not immaculately designed or anything, just to have a sense of drama to it."
Astarion,"And when you've been through all I have, you damn well are going to fight with what few assets the gods give you."
Astarion,"There's nothing more desirable in the world than a vampire, is there?"
Astarion,"What I've lost, what I've gained - it's all so much."
Astarion,"And gods, all those spawn, free in the Underdark."
Astarion,"I need some time, I think. Just to let it all sink in."
Astarion,Let's just go. This place reeks of death and I want to feel alive again.
Astarion,"And gods, all those spawn, dead in their cells. "
Astarion,"I'm glad you think so, because I'm not so sure. I just feel numb."
Astarion,"No. Well... maybe a little, but I'm not sure."
Astarion,"It's strange, knowing I'll never hear Cazador's voice again. Knowing it'll never command me to bow against my will."
Astarion,I'm free from him. Forever.
Astarion,"Invigorating? Terrifying? All of the above? I'm still trying to understand it, really."
Astarion,I came so close to losing everything back there. To losing myself.
Astarion,"But then again, I could feel something slipping away. I came so close to losing myself - losing everything I'd learned since meeting you. "
Astarion,"You're not wrong. Cazador left his mark on me in more ways than one - for a moment, I wanted to be just like him."
Astarion,We could have tried. We could have given them the same chance I had.
Astarion,I was able to go out into the world and make better choices. To go against my nature and become more than a blood-sucking monster. Maybe they would have done the same. 
Astarion,Or maybe not - but did we have the right to take that choice away from them?
Astarion,"Probably, yes. Destroying them wasn't a good solution, but maybe it was the least bad."
Astarion,I'm not sure. I feel a little numb.
Astarion,After all these years - these centuries - it's really over.
Astarion,That's it. He's gone.
Astarion,"So much for the better. My instincts are already so quick, the world seems slow around me."
Astarion,Karlach offered herself. We could just let her take the fall. That'd certainly be the easiest option.
Astarion,"More of an illithid, in your case."
Astarion,Tell me you'll consider the alternatives? I don't want to lose you.
Astarion,"Karlach seems willing to do it. It's not ideal, but there is a grim logic to it. "
Astarion,Just consider the alternatives before throwing away that beautiful face or yours.
Astarion,Why not let Karlach take the fall? She seems more than willing.
Astarion,I hope you're not actually considering this - we still have other options.
Astarion,So we can't wield the stones unless one of us becomes an illithid.
Astarion,I suppose that's the less convenient side of freedom - having to live with the choices you made.
Astarion,"All of that and the stones didn't even work? I swear, this is never-ending. "
Astarion,"Hello, my sweet little spawn."
Astarion,You'll be lonelier than I.
Astarion,"Very soon I will discover how to call my legions of wolves, become a sea of mist, run wrongside-up on roofs. Everything vampires do best. "
Astarion,"You could have, too. What a waste."
Astarion,I can take anything I want. I should have made you a spawn just to teach you that.
Astarion,I - I was pathetic then. What do you mean? Why would you say that?
Astarion,You will regret leaving me. More than anything you live to regret.
Astarion,You refused riches beyond belief. The world would have knelt before us united.
Astarion,"Yes, beautiful?"
Astarion,But let's not forget why we're here - Cazador needs to die. Everything else comes second.
Astarion,"Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was."
Astarion,"You saved me back there. I may not have appreciated it at the time, but I do now. Thank you."
Astarion,And what makes you think I have anything to say to you?
Astarion,I tried to give you a gift and you rejected me. Not just you - your whole body!
Astarion,Oh when has the world ever given a damn about 'fair'?
Astarion,"I thought you were better than this, you know. That you might make a worthy consort. But I was wrong."
Astarion,You're defective. Broken. Doomed.
Astarion,"We'll see this mind flayer business through, but once that's done, we're done."
Astarion,There she is - there's the gutsy devil I fell for.
Astarion,How disappointing that this is what's become of her.
Astarion,Pathetic.
Astarion,"No, I'm better than he ever was."
Astarion,I've marched forward into my beautiful new future. It's a pity you couldn't keep up.
Astarion,Good. Then we're done here.
Astarion,I handled it perfectly! It's you and your damn engine that ruined it.
Astarion,That's all you have to say? After everything I've done for you.
Astarion,The way she leered at me... the blood merchant... I can't get it out of my head...
Astarion,"It isn't like me. Not like me at all. I was being too precious, wasn't I? We could have used her potion."
Astarion,A moment of unpleasantry doesn't matter if there's a fine reward. I should have just gritted my teeth as always and let her have me for a bit.
Astarion,They... might? But there'll be consequences if they do - the Underdark is not a forgiving place. 
Astarion,"I hope so, because there'll be consequences if they can't. The Underdark is not a forgiving place. "
Astarion,After that - who knows? Everything that happened to those spawn is my fault in a way...
Astarion,"No, much as I'd like to become a lord ruling over the Underdark's vampire spawn, we have unfinished business with the mind flayers."
Astarion,You did more than that. You believed in me - believed I was enough just the way I am.
Astarion,"When I look at my future, anything and everything feels possible now."
Astarion,I really thought the stones were going to work. Our options are getting slimmer and slimmer.
Astarion,"And nice as it would have been to share this with a partner, I'm glad I get to share it with a friend."
Astarion,"You saved me from myself and let me walk a new path where I can be free. Truly, honestly free."
Astarion,"This is a gift, you know. Thank you - I won't forget it. "
Astarion,"And I get to share it with you, as a partner. An equal."
Astarion,So am I. Fun as all that power would have been... this feels more 'me'.
Astarion,But you saw something in me - someone else I could be. Someone who could break the cycle of power and terror that started centuries ago.
Astarion,Neither was I. Not until I sank the dagger into Cazador's chest and the light went out of his eyes.
Astarion,We could have tried. We could have given them the same chance I was given.
Astarion,"Then again, how many lives would that have cost? Even in the Underdark, they would have been dangerous."
Astarion,"I don't know, maybe there just weren't any good options. I only hope we picked the least bad one."
Astarion,"No, it can't. And I can't say I'm unhappy about it either."
Astarion,I only hope my siblings are up to the challenge. The Underdark is not a forgiving place.
Astarion,You could have said the same about me when we first met. People can change. But perhaps you're right.
Astarion,"I have to hope so. And if not, at least there's only so much damage they can do in the Underdark."
Astarion,But that first rush of freedom can be intoxicating - I didn't always make the best decisions when I first tasted it. They'll need guidance.
Astarion,"I am - well, not 'happy' with how things turned out. But this does feel right."
Astarion,I had no say in the matter - it was my master's command. 
Astarion,"You're right, I am. How could I not, after coming face-to-face with the ghosts of my past?"
Astarion,"Actually, ghosts would have been preferable over starving vampire spawn."
Astarion,I could not agree more. To hells with them all.
Astarion,"Gods, really? Saving a drow I can understand, but saving gnomes?"
Astarion,"But if you insist on being a hero, I won't get in your way. Just don't expect me to help either. "
Astarion,"Well of course we can leave him, it's the easiest thing in the world. We just have to keep on walking."
Astarion,"Haha! That's - oh, you're serious."
Astarion,"I'm fine with either, naturally. The last thing I want is to ruin these nails digging through rock."
Astarion,"So, are we saving this 'Nere' from suffocating or leaving him to die?"
Astarion,"You gave up your freedom to save your father? I will never understand you, Ravengard."
Astarion,Wyll gave up freedom to save his father? I will never understand people like that.
Astarion,"I don't envy the choice that mind flayer gave you, but for what it's worth, I think you did the right thing."
Astarion,And of course the dead pixies were just a lovely touch.
Astarion,Being willing to turn away from what he knew and bending the darkness to his will? Wonderful to see.
Astarion,"I have to admit, I am impressed with Gale and his new lantern."
Astarion,We don't all blend in as well as you do. Although I imagine that'll change if we ever reach Baldur's Gate.
Astarion,"The sooner we get out of this gith warren, the better."
Astarion,"Ha! Defeating a devil in his own home feels very, very good, actually."
Astarion,I might just hold you to that.
Astarion,"Just when you think your day can't get any stranger, you end up traipsing around an impossible-looking shadow dimension."
Astarion,Just something to think about.
Astarion,"Honestly, just once could we end up somewhere normal? "
Astarion,"I've been in more unsettling places than this, but not many."
Astarion,"And if that fails, then there's always killing them quietly. "
Astarion,"And while we're at it, we can see how many more of these little worms we can harvest."
Astarion,"It gave me another gift, too. Just like it did the first time it appeared. Rather generous, if you ask me."
Astarion,"I had another visit from that dream figure. I take it you did too? It claims that if we infiltrate the heart of the cult that's giving out these parasites, we'll find the answers we're looking for."
Astarion,Most people would have held on to that scroll for as long as they could bear to. And probably a century or two longer than that.
Astarion,"Jaheira has steel in her, I'll say that. It's not easy to walk away from immortality."
Astarion,"Nice as it is, she still doesn't have the best hair in the camp."
Astarion,"Nice as it is, you still don't have the best hair in the camp."
Astarion,We have a new look for a new Shadowheart.
Astarion,"Ah, we have a new look for a new you."
Astarion,It's as subtle and elegant as everything the gith do.
Astarion,Your people have such a talent for subtlety and elegance.
Astarion,Should I be surprised that the key to freeing this gith prince is a hammer?
Astarion,Should I be surprised that the key to freeing your prince is a hammer?
Astarion,I don't see what Shadowheart got so upset about - it was not that nice of a temple.
Astarion,At last. Time to enjoy a little vengeance. 
Astarion,"Defying Mystra, declaring that he'll rule the Karsite Weave - I didn't know Gale had it in him."
Astarion,"A tavern maybe? Or a nice, friendly brothel? I'd take anything at this rate."
Astarion,"Because if you continue to get between me and what I want, I will have to find a way through you."
Astarion,Not that I don't understand - I'd probably keep them for myself too. But do consider sharing next time.
Astarion,"Ah, that's how it is. Pity."
Astarion,"Gods, do you have any idea how much that hurt?"
Astarion,"What in the sweet hells were you thinking, activating that lance? I was right there!"
Astarion,"I was under no delusions, don't you worry."
Astarion,"Now, though, I don't think, honestly, that your services are worth the cost."
Astarion,But this is what I do. Those are the talents I have.
Astarion,"I can guarantee, it stings far more to have to pay your way through the night with your own body for hundreds of years."
Astarion,Don't be silly.
Astarion,"There isn't going to be any more 'us', though. I just don't see the point."
Astarion,This is what I do. Who did you think you were dealing with? Some fairy tale prince?
Astarion,You get a moment of escape with a world-endingly beautiful vampire. I get someone to defend me from Cazador.
Astarion,"Back in the forest, we both came out on the winning side. The game was clear."
Astarion,Perhaps you got the wrong idea. I never slept with you for pleasure alone. Couldn't you tell?
Astarion,And why exactly would I want to do that?
Astarion,Seeking to correct your mistake?
Astarion,Absolutely not.
Astarion,Perhaps.
Astarion,We need to talk about what just happened.
Astarion,Although I do appreciate you trying to fix your mistake. Just don't do it again. 
Astarion,Excuse me? That was the least you could do after dropping a building on me!
Astarion,"Well, apparently there's a limit. Somewhere between a nice summer's day and the full, concentrated power of the sun."
Astarion,Next time just warn me before you do something stupid. At least then I can get out of the blast radius.
Astarion,"But now that we know it's safe, I am all for experimenting. "
Astarion,"I admit, I wasn't keen to be the first to try it. Just in case there were any 'surprise' side effects."
Astarion,My only complaint is you didn't want to share. I wouldn't mind indulging myself.
Astarion,"And there isn't a tentacle to be seen! Not a bad deal, I'd say. "
Astarion,"So, you've indulged. Just helped yourself to a little more power, I see."
Astarion,"Ah, so that's how it is? A pity."
Astarion,"Thank you, your generosity is appreciated."
Astarion,Excellent! I'll have a rummage around and help myself in my own good time.
Astarion,"On the one hand, you're right. On the other, don't be so wet behind the ears. "
Astarion,"But if it doesn't, who knows what kind of power we could unlock? And power is always worth a little risk."
Astarion,"Oh I have my reservations, no question. First of all, it looks disgusting."
Astarion,"I don't relish the thought, but if you're going to just leave it sitting in your pack - well, one of us should try it."
Astarion,"You know, if that parasite isn't to your taste, I'd be happy to consume it in your stead."
Astarion,And I think I was safer with the mind flayers.
Astarion,If you must.
Astarion,Gladly.
Astarion,Gods. All right - what's on your mind?
Astarion,Now shall we go? Or do you have any other chaos you need to unleash here?
Astarion,"Second, there's a non-zero chance that it'll turn me into a purple, glistening monster."
Astarion,Indeed.
Astarion,"So, we can add one bald wall of muscle to our little group."
Astarion,I can't believe Mystra's demanding Gale sacrifice himself to destroy the Absolute.
Astarion,This is it. I'm almost home.
Astarion,Wyrm's Crossing - the 'Welcome' mat of Baldur's Gate.
Astarion,Sorry - did you want something? Or just looking for a distraction? 
Astarion,"I much prefer it when I'm the one prowling in the shadows, about to strike."
Astarion,"It feels like we're being watching - hunted, even - but there's nothing out there, only more darkness."
Astarion,"So, Gale's hedging his bets with Mystra. I can't say I blame him."
Astarion,Although she may be even more pleased to know who put that bounty on her head in the first place.
Astarion,Nightsong will be pleased to know Lorroakan isn't after her hide anymore.
Astarion,I can't even tell if any of you are acting strange because you've been replaced or because this group is full of weirdos.
Astarion,"It's not enough we have a gallery of villains to look out for, but now we could be infiltrated by a shapechanger?"
Astarion,I'm not surprised that the gith's insane device didn't remove our tadpoles. I'm just disappointed. 
Astarion,Killing that giant oaf was the right thing to do. Even if it meant losing the Harper.
Astarion,"There's a time for talking and a time for killing. This, my friend, is the latter."
Astarion,"You could watch out for anyone acting strangely, but... well, you know the lunatics we camp with."
Astarion,"So, we have a shapechanger at our camp? Good luck finding her."
Astarion,"I'd shake her hand, but she can still snap me in two, so... probably safest to skip it."
Astarion,"I'd shake your hand, but you can still snap me in two, so... perhaps not."
Astarion,"I wasn't sure you'd want to talk, after Gortash and... well, everything."
Astarion,"So, the untouchable Karlach is untouchable no more."
Astarion,"I wish I could tell you dying isn't so bad, but my experience has been quite... specific. Sorry."
Astarion,"But if you say you're all right, I believe you."
Astarion,"So, it's a quest to free your parents, is it?"
Astarion,"It's almost a pity things ended so amicably, seeing those two duke it out would be fun."
Astarion,Nothing like a little camp drama to spice up the evening.
Astarion,I do hope it goes well. We've pissed off enough gods already.
Astarion,"So, Mystra's requested a chat with you? Unusually polite for a god."
Astarion,"For the Lady of Loss, she does not like losing."
Astarion,I just hope what you got was worth all of this.
Astarion,I suppose it was only a matter of time until Shar took vengeance.
Astarion,If you survive long enough to enjoy it.
Astarion,If Wyll survives long enough to enjoy it.
Astarion,"Well, Grand Duke Ravengard. A position like that comes with a lot of wealth and luxury."
Astarion,"Congratulations, your grace. A position like that comes with a lot of wealth and luxury."
Astarion,As you command.
Astarion,"That being said, moping changes nothing. So, what's next?"
Astarion,"I was trying to think of something more profound to say, but no. It just 'kind of sucks.'"
Astarion,It does...
Astarion,"So, what shall we talk about?"
Astarion,You don't have to be. Sometimes things are just terrible.
Astarion,So one of our own was the leader of an entire cult?
Astarion,"If it wasn't for you, I'd still be stuck in Cazador's kennels. So, thank you. For being that evil bastard."
Astarion,"I won't lie, I'm a little impressed."
Astarion,"I thought I knew what it was like to be a prisoner, but this place is something else entirely."
Astarion,Much less be bossed around by one.
Astarion,Much less be bossed around by her.
Astarion,"Well, this is exciting. It's not every day you get to speak to a god-queen."
Astarion,"This must be exciting, it's not every day you get to speak to your god-queen."
Astarion,Or however this sordid tale ends. I wouldn't want to presume.
Astarion,"There's one more stone in our pockets, which means one step closer to glory."
Astarion,Although maybe you're used to it? I imagine this feels just like home.
Astarion,"Not a worry for those of us who don't breathe, of course."
Astarion,"Careful not to inhale too much smoke, your lungs won't appreciate it."
Astarion,"A pity, it would have made for a fine night's entertainment."
Astarion,I really thought you and the gith might fight to the death over that artefact.
Astarion,"This place is miserable, even for the house of a god."
Astarion,"Not that I approve of goblins, of course - filthy little beasts - but I do like a good den of debauchery."
Astarion,"Ah, drink it in - that sweet, sweet chaos."
Astarion,"And a waste of a perfectly good Gale, I suppose."
Astarion,It's just a waste of a perfectly good cult that we could be controlling.
Astarion,"Your parents are at peace. And so're you, it seems."
Astarion,Good riddance to the shapechanger. Couldn't have happened to a worse wretch.
Astarion,"It hurt, watching you bow to your mistress. I thought you were stronger than that."
Astarion,"It was sickening, watching Lae'zel bow to that monstrosity. I thought she was stronger."
Astarion,"We probably should save the wizard, though. He does have his moments."
Astarion,"One the one hand, killing Gortash would be fun. On the other, Gale can be very annoying."
Astarion,"So, we kill Gortash or Gale dies? It's not an easy call."
Astarion,"In a very 'look at me twice and I'll dismember you' kind of way, of course."
Astarion,I am enjoying the latest addition to our little group - Lae'zel is delightful.
Astarion,Good for her.
Astarion,Good for her. And good for you.
Astarion,Good for you.
Astarion,I'm sure he'll come in handy. Maybe as a doorstop.
Astarion,"So, Lae'zel's going to war with Vlaakith? Going to break her chains in Baldur's Gate?"
Astarion,"So, you're going to war with Vlaakith? Going to break your chains in Baldur's Gate?"
Astarion,This place brings back the worst memories. It's like being kidnapped all over again.
Astarion,"Oh, certainly. If you want to live in ignorance, I'm happy to let you die in it too."
Astarion,"Fine. If you don't want to hear the truth, I can't force your ears open."
Astarion,"So, if you don't want to discuss the truth, what do you want from me?"
Astarion,"I know enough of it. I've lived enough of it. But if you won't hear me, that's on you."
Astarion,"Some of us reach for freedom, while others just grow to love their chains, I suppose."
Astarion,"Some just grow to love their chains, I suppose."
Astarion,"So, Lae'zel's going to war with your queen? Going to break your chains in Baldur's Gate?"
Astarion,Farewell.
Astarion,I'll see you later.
Astarion,I think we've said enough.
Astarion,Cazador did something to me - I need to know what it was.
Astarion,"I'm a pawn in some game, but I need to know what we're playing. "
Astarion,What if there is no other way? What if this is it?
Astarion,We made a deal with Raphael - his destruction for the secrets written on my back. 
Astarion,I hope you're not serious about helping that hellsbeast.
Astarion,"It's not a deal, strictly speaking - more of a gentleman's agreement. 'I scratch your back, you read mine.'"
Astarion,"You're talking about a vampire and a devil, darling. We're both rather good at sneaking about in the dark."
Astarion,"And now all that's left to do is... well, find this damned thing and kill it."
Astarion,Excellent! I knew you wouldn't baulk at a challenge.
Astarion,"It's curious, I had a visit from our impish friend Raphael last night. He wanted to talk about my scars."
Astarion,How dare you talk to me after what you've done?
Astarion,'Overreacting'? After what you took from me?
Astarion,But you didn't. And now I have to deal with the consequences.
Astarion,Of course you should have listened to me!
Astarion,"So, unhappy as it is, our fates still seem to be intertwined."
Astarion,"I wish it were that simple, but our odds of surviving this are still better together."
Astarion,"Fool that I was. But don't worry, I won't be repeating that mistake."
Astarion,And the only way I'll know for sure is if that orthon dies.
Astarion,"No, I chose this. I trusted you to help me."
Astarion,"All right, if you say so..."
Astarion,"Very well, then. We'll roll the dice and let's see what fate decides."
Astarion,"Our devilish friend - Raphael. If anyone has the resources to find out what it says, surely he will."
Astarion,"Our devilish friend - Raphael. If anyone's going to know about Infernal text, he will."
Astarion,"My friend, I'd never dream of it."
Astarion,"Well, we won't know until we ask, now, will we?"
Astarion,Meanwhile I think I'll spend some time studying the art of infernal negotiations.
Astarion,"Unfortunately, he comes and goes on his own schedule, so we'll just have to look out for any sulphurous odours or the sound of questionable poetry."
Astarion,I knew you'd see the pragmatic side!
Astarion,"Well, you know what they say - better the devil you know. "
Astarion,"Our devilish friend - Raphael. If anyone's going to know about infernal contracts, he will."
Astarion,"No, we need someone with a little more expertise. And I think I know who to ask."
Astarion,"Unless you've suddenly become an expert in mysterious runes, I don't think that will achieve much."
Astarion,I'm afraid that through those runes - somehow - Cazador might still be able to dominate me. 
Astarion,There's something not right about all this. There's more to that 'poem' than everyday sadism.
Astarion,"I don't know much about Infernal, but I know anything written in devilscript is going to be bad news."
Astarion,That fragment of a devil's contract or whatever the hells it is.
Astarion,I've been thinking about the runes Cazador carved into my back.
Astarion,This is important. Do not play games with me.
Astarion,I see. So that's where we stand.
Astarion,"It's best for you, maybe - not for me. You've shown your true colours. "
Astarion,"You may be right. That doesn't make it sting any less, though."
Astarion,I'm done with you - done with everyone. I'll fix this myself; you can rot for all I care.
Astarion,Why? 
Astarion,What?
Astarion,"I'm not afraid. Not of you, not of your darkness, and not of our future. "
Astarion,This little adventure of ours has taught me that we can't let our lives be ruled by fear. Or else we never really live.
Astarion,"Well... Goodbye, then. I suppose. You brought my dead heart back to life. It will keep beating."
Astarion,If that's what you want... then that's where we'll leave it.
Astarion,"But I trust you won't kill me. And if you do, then I've gotten sloppy and probably have it coming. "
Astarion,Cazador used his tortures to strike terror into me. But I've rarely been more afraid than on the night when I feared Bhaal had claimed you for good.
Astarion,I am. And beautiful - not enough people mention that.
Astarion,I bet I still get more stares walking down a street than you.
Astarion,What you cannot do is make my decisions for me. I've had more than enough of that in my life.
Astarion,"Oh, come off. You're wonderful. I don't care what you look like."
Astarion,Why? What's changed?
Astarion,Oh shit. I - did I do something wrong?
Astarion,Or perhaps I'll just decide some things are worth incineration.
Astarion,And who knows? Perhaps some day you'll be free of that engine?
Astarion,You have no idea how mutual the feeling is. But there are other ways to connect with a person. 
Astarion,"I know, I'm better than he was. Stronger. Finally free of my past."
Astarion,I'm who I always wanted to be. I have everything I ever wanted.
Astarion,"If you're too stupid to see what you're losing, then you never deserved to have it in the first place."
Astarion,"I don't have to take this from you, you ingrate."
Astarion,I needed you for this. And you came up short.
Astarion,"Just know that my patience has its limits, and you're dangerously close to them."
Astarion,"Much as it pains me, you do have a point. Our odds are still better together."
Astarion,You had a chance to do the right thing. And you choose a devil over me.
Astarion,My chance to know what Cazador did to me? What he has planned for me?
Astarion,You thought it was right to take this from me? 
Astarion,"No information about my scars, no leads on where to turn now, and no idea why I'm wasting my time with you."
Astarion,Now the orthon's free to traipse back to the Hells and I'm left with nothing.
Astarion,"Any excuse to get my shirt off, I see."
Astarion,"Now the orthon has a new contract, Raphael has his killing machine back, and I have nothing!"
Astarion,"You gave me precious, impossible moments of comfort. I only really wanted a few more."
Astarion,"From the start, I was rather counting the hours until it was going to end. Midnight chimes, eh?"
Astarion,I was beginning to believe someone truly wanted me. But I shouldn't have deluded myself.
Astarion,"Would I were. It's true, you don't deserve this facade any longer."
Astarion,"I - I can hardly blame you. I don't exactly have much to offer right now, beyond new burdens to carry."
Astarion,"I don't want to hear anything like that from you again, my pet. You know I adore you terribly."
Astarion,"No, I thought not. Let's keep it that way."
Astarion,SILENCE! How dare you speak his name?
Astarion,You said you had a plan for that hellsbeast - you said we'd kill him!
Astarion,"But no, I don't think another viewing will serve any purpose. I need someone with a little more expertise. "
Astarion,"Find an expert, of course. And I already have one in mind."
Astarion,"Oh yes, we all got the same treatment."
Astarion,Pray to whomever you like. Just leave me out of it.
Astarion,"I do care that you didn't tell me until now. Yes, we've all had our secrets, but we need to work as a team."
Astarion,"Hells, that's what you've been tiptoeing around? Why would I care who you worship?"
Astarion,Just don't come preaching to me about your Lady of Loss. I've lost plenty already - I'd quite like to keep what I have.
Astarion,"I am glad you told me, though. I'm glad you trusted me enough."
Astarion,"Oh, that's what you've been tiptoeing around? My dear, I couldn't care less."
Astarion,And I thought the nests in the kennels were bad... This lurked below...
Astarion,They're all lambs for his slaughter. And if I was to take his place... they'd all die by my hand.
Astarion,There's only one reason they'd all still be here... he must need them for the ritual.
Astarion,I could care less about that... I wonder if they'll tear me apart for what I did...
Astarion,"He never let us drink, he never wanted us to know. I had no idea there was worse than drainage and death at his hand. I couldn't imagine."
Astarion,All the blood he demanded... I thought he was gorging himself on... He never could have finished half of it.
Astarion,He didn't do anything at all... I can't say the same of all my victims...
Astarion,"It's just sickening, seeing them again. I don't know what else."
Astarion,Thank you... Yes... this will all be over soon.
Astarion,We must find Cazador. This must end.
Astarion,I know they will. I know I won't.
Astarion,I do care that you didn't tell me until now. I thought we were a team.
Astarion,Well? What is it?
Astarion,I just need some time to myself.
Astarion,"Not now, I need to think."
Astarion,"Not now, not ever."
Astarion,Never!
Astarion,Always.
Astarion,"Anything for you, darling."
Astarion,It would be my pleasure.
Astarion,"Oh, that sounds like fun."
Astarion,Of course!
Astarion,Yes.
Astarion,"Don't hate me. I just did what I had to. I swear, I did what I had to."
Astarion,Could we not?
Astarion,"I'll think about it, but no promises."
Astarion,This isn't the time or the place.
Astarion,Do you mind? I need a moment.
Astarion,Not now.
Astarion,"Well, that was disgusting."
Astarion,"Hahaha! Oh, that was awful."
Astarion,Well that was wonderful!
Astarion,Perhaps. I need to think about it.
Astarion,No.
Astarion,"So, it's a quest to free Shadowheart's parents, is it?"
Astarion,"It should be. I don't want to be like them... They're pathetic, horrible..."
Astarion,They're in a state far beyond anything that ever happened to me.
Astarion,I'm sure he'll turn up at one point or another.
Astarion,That's quite the achievement. But trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Astarion,All in due time. But not now.
Astarion,Perfect. I knew you would understand.
Astarion,"You will help me find him, won't you?"
Astarion,"When I was taken to his House, I was caught off-guard. But now... Now I know what to ask for."
Astarion,Precisely. Exactly.
Astarion,I think he'll stay the perfect gentleman. As long as we read the fine print.
Astarion,"Help me find him, and you'll find out."
Astarion,I hope we end up seeing our friend Raphael down here somewhere.
Astarion,The perfect preying ground for a devil who offers a way out for those who sign on the dotted line.
Astarion,"This dark land must be filled with the broken, the beaten, the desperate."
Astarion,"I was thinking about someone a little more familiar, actually."
Astarion,Oh no! I wouldn't want to bother your... intimidating companion. I had someone else in mind.
Astarion,"No, I thought I might ask someone else. "
Astarion,"But I can't exactly stroll up and ask to look at their backs, can I? They're still under Cazador's clawed thumb."
Astarion,"If there are other parts to this contract, I'm sure they'll be carved into the others. "
Astarion,You never asked me to take my shirt off. 
Astarion,I always thought they were a sign of my humiliation. I never realised there might be more to them.
Astarion,But Raphael told us he can make the impossible come true. I have to try my luck.
Astarion,I don't trust him. He doesn't trust me. We are using one another for our mutual benefit. You should try it some time.
Astarion,We have to kill Cazador. That has to come first.
Astarion,"But from time to time, there was a Sebastian..."
Astarion,"Many of them are petty criminals, street drunkards and brothel-goers."
Astarion,I would have killed you...
Astarion,I don't even want to think what would have happened to you...
Astarion,"Gods, I can't say you're wrong. I can only say I'm so glad we didn't meet then."
Astarion,"If they are unleashed, they will cause incredible carnage. They will be ravenous. They must die. Better they serve a purpose."
Astarion,It doesn't matter. I will need to sacrifice them all if I want to perform the ritual.
Astarion,Decades of hatred will have piled up inside of them. I can't even begin to imagine.
Astarion,"Everyone who ever trusted me enough to let down their guard... Innocents, idiots, and the unlucky."
Astarion,The children I can understand - leverage against their parents - but Sebastian?
Astarion,Gods above - he kept Sebastian.
Astarion,And I'm married to a tarrasque named Johnathan. Anything else you'd like to know?
Astarion,I'm actually a princess of House Nightstar.
Astarion,Well - if you must know...
Astarion,The depravity of the act was a distraction. I have to get to the truth of it.
Astarion,"I used to just be sickened, thinking it was his sadistic pleasure. But there's more. There was method to it. "
Astarion,"Thank you. Honestly, though, I was just trying not to think about them, but there's a lead now."
Astarion,I should have known what Cazador was capable of. He's played us for such fools.
Astarion,My name's Astarion. I was in Baldur's Gate when they snatched me and put that thing in my head.
Astarion,And here I was worried I'd be the only one with a difficult family reunion waiting in the city.
Astarion,This temple certainly is grand.
Astarion,"You gave up your father to have freedom? An understandable decision. Sacrifices must be made, after all."
Astarion,The gith probably think decapitation is a perfectly reasonable 'cure'.
Astarion,They probably think decapitation is a perfectly reasonable 'cure'.
Astarion,"We have to figure out what's happening. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest."
Astarion,"Indeed we can't. We have to figure out what's happening. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest."
Astarion,"You're not wrong. We have to figure out what's going on. Why we aren't changing, what's planned for us, and why a devil is suddenly taking an interest."
Astarion,"If we can answer those questions, we might have a chance. And if not - well, we'll be exactly where this Raphael wants us."
Astarion,"Oh, can we? Because you've got it all figured out, I'm sure."
Astarion,"And of course you know why we're interesting enough that a devil - pardon, a cambion - would proposition us. Because if you don't know that, you may as well sign over your soul now."
Astarion,"We may escape whatever web we're trapped in, but until we know what's going on, this Raphael has us exactly where he wants us."
Astarion,"If we don't know what we're walking into, that bridge will collapse under us. The devil has a plan - he's playing with us."
Astarion,"Maybe, but all that 'take your time, I'll wait' nonsense? He's playing with us."
Astarion,I'm not about to trade a vampiric master for an infernal one. He's playing with us.
Astarion,I know you said there's a cure here - I just hope it's not 'decapitation'.
Astarion,I'm not about to throw my soul away. He's playing with us.
Astarion,And he might be right. We've had no luck so far.
Astarion,The orthon is nothing. I'll have my satisfaction when Raphael makes good on his word.
Astarion,"Wyll gave up his father to have freedom? An understandable decision. Sacrifices must be made, after all."
Astarion,In an old pair of boots? In an abandoned outhouse? In my own bedroll?
Astarion,Especially if his fall means your rise.
Astarion,"Your devil's a sly little wretch, I'll give her that."
Astarion,"So, Mystra's requested a chat with Gale? Unusually polite for a god."
Astarion,"I know the look is meant to be very 'murder' heavy, but it's a bit much. Even for me."
Astarion,Even a wet rag like Zevlor deserved a better death than that.
Astarion,"Wyll's devil is a sly little wretch, I'll give her that."
Astarion,"Cazador, my old master, liked to toy with people too. Let them think there was hope right until the end. Until he snatched it all away."
Astarion,Creatures like them don't play games unless they know they can win.
Astarion,"Maybe, but he's not the only one spinning a web for us."
Astarion,We keep hunting for answers. What other choice do we have? 
Astarion,This is no ordinary mind flayer parasite. Who tampered with it and why? What do they have planned for us?
Astarion,"And why are we important enough that a devil comes knocking on our door? If we find those answers, we might have a chance."
Astarion,"Oh, will you? Because you've got it all figured out, I'm sure."
Astarion,You know who tampered with the parasite. And why. And what they have planned for us.
Astarion,"And of course you know why we're interesting enough that a devil would come to proposition us. Because if you don't know that, you may as well sign over your soul now."
Astarion,"It reminds me of Cazador, taunting his slaves with hope when he knew the game was rigged."
Astarion,"It reminds me of my old master Cazador, taunting his slaves with hope when he knew the game was rigged."
Astarion,You're a warlock. You understand how dangerous the wrong deal can be.
Astarion,"I'm glad to hear it, although just being careful might not be enough."
Astarion,Especially if the old Duke's fall means his rise.
Astarion,The devil turns up where it pleases him. But we're bound to run into him soon.
Astarion,Hmm. Hrmmm.
Astarion,Thank you for helping me. It was very kind.
Astarion,"I am... not. I just don't want to lose my gods-given good looks, really. Wouldn't that be a crime?"
Astarion,It isn't about the pain... it's about being beholden to the tadpole's influence.
Astarion,"If we mastered the tadpoles, it would be different. But right now that mastery depends on an illithid and its githyanki slave."
Astarion,"Good. I wouldn't have, anyway."
Astarion,I'm not going to submit to this. Don't ask me again.
Astarion,We both know what it is capable of. But I'm not touching it.
Astarion,"Yes, my sweet? What is it?"
Astarion,"Well, now's as good a time as any."
Astarion,"All right, let's talk. Who knows when we'll have another chance. "
Astarion,"Yes, my treasure?"
Astarion,"You want to talk? Oh, that's very cute."
Astarion,"Go on, then. I'll allow it."
Astarion,'Us'. I still love the sound of that.
Astarion,"I'm all pointy ears, my love."
Astarion,Can we? I suppose we can.
Astarion,"Nothing special, of course. You're only the first person who I truly care for."
Astarion,We are sovereigns. My sole endeavour now is to make this world yours and mine alone.
Astarion,Thank you.
Astarion,I don't need a partner who's willing to unleash the demons in my head. You and me are over.
Astarion,Just don't ask me again.
Astarion,All right... I'll do it.
Astarion,"I'm glad you had your fun, then. I am here to provide an endless array of delights."
Astarion,"If such power would please you, darling, I won't stop you."
Astarion,Good. I look forward to having a formidable ally with no sense of self-preservation.
Astarion,Especially not with the you-know-whats still wriggling in our heads.
Astarion,Honestly? I don't love walking into a den of killer gith warriors.
Astarion,"I know they're your people, but I still don't love walking into a den of killer gith warriors."
Astarion,It is not the time to chat - move!
Astarion,"Gods, I can't even take solace in the lie."
Astarion,"You almost pity Orin, taking Minthara like that. Give her half a chance and she'll gut the shapeshifter like a fish."
Astarion,That was before I knew the cost. Before I knew it meant transforming into some grotesque beast.
Astarion,I - I don't want to turn into anything else. I can't do that again. I can't watch my body be taken over.
Astarion,I'll happily murder my way to whatever powerful artefacts we can make use of. Point at the back and I'll stab.
Astarion,Just don't ask me to sacrifice my body.
Astarion,It hasn't been mine for so long.
Astarion,"I'm still nothing, aren't I? Just an expandable frail spawn who will burn to a crisp soon enough."
Astarion,"All right. Fine. Give me the worm. I will take every weapon I can, damn it all."
Astarion,I'm really not sure...
Astarion,Damn it. Damn you.
Astarion,"I remember how it hurt when I turned to a vampire. My body writhed and warped while I was utterly helpless, the grip of death owned my heart as it beat its last."
Astarion,"Seven thousand souls have given me the power to carve out my own future, and I want you to be part of it."
Astarion,What in the nine Hells is going on? I thought we had him!
Astarion,Cazador liked to toy with people too. Let them think there was hope right until the end. Until he snatched it all away.
Astarion,Hmm? Yes of course. Obviously.
Astarion,You can forget just how much colour there is in the world.
Astarion,This is the first time in two hundred years I've seen these streets in the sunlight.
Astarion,Gods...
Astarion,"Also, she'll want to cave his skull in and, honestly, I would not mind seeing that."
Astarion,We should tell Aylin that Lorroakan is hunting her. She has a right to know.
Astarion,She'll hold on to that scroll for as long as she can bear to. And perhaps a century or two longer than that.
Astarion,"No matter what Jaheira says, immortality is a difficult drug to kick."
Astarion,"Shadowheart's parents are at peace. And so's she, it seems."
Astarion,"Actually I'm not really clear on what we have to do, but I assume we're smashing something."
Astarion,"So, we have the hammer. Now all we have to do is..."
Astarion,"And that's saying something, given some of the things you've exposed me to."
Astarion,"Of all the places you've dragged me, this might just be the most foul."
Astarion,Not that I wouldn't understand - respect it even - but it does leave one a little nervous.
Astarion,I hope you don't make a habit of betraying your travelling companions.
Astarion,"Present company excluded, I hope."
Astarion,"I swear, druids care more about the plants of this land than the people."
Astarion,Sorry - did you want something?
Astarion,Just like that hulking bear to stomp off in a huff.
Astarion,"Hmm? Yes, of course we do. I was just..."
Astarion,Perhaps Raphael even will gain from setting us on this course. Who can say?
Astarion,"But you're right, this isn't the time. Cazador is our objective - nothing can distract me from that. "
Astarion,"No, we can't. Not after seeing those wretches in the cells. If I flee now, he wins."
Astarion,"Next, we find Cazador."
Astarion,"And once we find him... well, let's hope fate is on our side."
Astarion,"Shh! He's close, I know it."
Astarion,Not now - we can't afford distractions.
Astarion,Quiet! Anyone could be lurking nearby.
Astarion,"Before anything else, I need to know where it's happening."
Astarion,"To the public, Cazador is an ordinary noble. A little reclusive perhaps, but just another of 'the great and the good' of Baldur's Gate."
Astarion,"He has a grand palace on the hills of the Gate, where he hosts the city's high society."
Astarion,"I don't know if he'd perform the ritual there - it feels too public, he'd risk exposure."
Astarion,"I know. Subtle, isn't it?"
Astarion,"To where? For how long? If this worm shrivels, I'll be in his power from the second he lays eyes on me."
Astarion,He has to die. While my body is still my own to command.
Astarion,"I hope so, because I am not striking another deal with Raphael. Who knows what he'd demand this time. "
Astarion,"But if the citizens of Baldur's Gate don't know anything, my brothers and sisters might. Cazador is a master of secrets, but the other spawn must have seen something."
Astarion,Mephistopheles is one of the Lords of the Nine Hells. Raphael is not going to let any ire be tracked back to him.
Astarion,"Right, sorry - what's next?"
Astarion,"You almost pity Orin, taking Lae'zel like that. Give her half a chance and she'll rip out the shapeshifter's spine."
Astarion,All I know is I need to unravel the secrets around Cazador's ritual. And I can only do that in Baldur's Gate.
Astarion,I really thought you and Shadowheart might fight to the death over that artefact.
Astarion,"So, Gale's agreed to be a good boy and hand the Crown over to Mystra?"
Astarion,Well. That will take some time to process.
Astarion,"I've killed my fair share of people, but wiping out an entire building with a cannon powered by the sun?"
Astarion,You can't be serious. You'd cast me out over this?
Astarion,"Think of what you're losing. Now that I'm well-fed, I'm more capable than ever."
Astarion,Fine. See how far you get without me.
Astarion,Cross my heart and hope to - you have my word.
Astarion,How benevolent of you. 
Astarion,"Now, was there anything else?"
Astarion,Thank goodness for that.
Astarion,And I do apologise for last night. I may have gotten a little... overexcited?
Astarion,Leave? You can't be serious. 
Astarion,Fine by me. So what would you like to talk about?
Astarion,"'Shop around', he said. He seems sure we won't find anything."
Astarion,"Given that a hag couldn't solve our wriggling little problem, he might be right."
Astarion,"I hope you're right, but I don't like this. He's playing with us."
Astarion,"He reminds me of - well, someone I used to know. Someone that liked to play with people."
Astarion,"Defying Mystra, declaring that you'll rule the Karsite Weave - Gale my boy, I didn't know you had it in you."
Astarion,I'm just so proud.
Astarion,I'm almost tempted to tell Shadowheart what she did. To see if I can jog her memory.
Astarion,"I doubt Shar would take kindly to anyone meddling in her little project, though."
Astarion,"Present company excluded, of course. You can be murderous as you like."
Astarion,All I wanted was to get a worm out of my head - I didn't sign up for dimensional travel and murderous gith.
Astarion,I did not go to the Hells and back because I like his company - if anyone has to make the sacrifice it should be him.
Astarion,I can't believe Orpheus wants one of us to transform.
Astarion,"I know what my decision would be. But we're all different, of course."
Astarion,"Who'd want to hold a power like the Crown of Karsus in their hands, just to hand it to someone else?"
Astarion,"Hedging your bets with Mystra, I see? I can't say I blame you."
Astarion,"You looked a little ill last night, but you've certainly recovered."
Astarion,Nothing to do but follow him and finish the job.
Astarion,Agh! Gods damn it!
Astarion,'Killed' feels like a strong word. Not many corpses have your vigour.
Astarion,"Now, I admit, I got carried away last night. I apologise."
Astarion,"But look at you now - perfectly healthy! So let's not fall out over this. We still need each other, after all."
Astarion,That's the spirit! A team once again.
Astarion,"And of course, what happened last night shall never be repeated."
Astarion,"A strong, well-fed vampire? I'm a powerful weapon - you'd be a fool to toss me aside now."
Astarion,"Anyway, last night was an aberration. It will never happen again."
Astarion,What do you say? Can we let bygones be bygones?
Astarion,"I understand you're upset, but let's not get carried away."
Astarion,I don't know. But isn't it nice? Not to know.
Astarion,You're not a victim. Not a target. Not just one night it's better to forget.
Astarion,'Spawn' is an ugly word. I really do prefer 'consort'.
Astarion,Good to see you're willing to do what it takes to get power. Even if it means defying the gods themselves.
Astarion,"So, this is the abode of our dear Absolute? It's about as cheerful as expected."
Astarion,Or it's... undersides? Because it's - you know what I mean.
Astarion,"Although it must appeal to anyone with an aversion to the sun, so I suppose it has its upsides. "
Astarion,"So this is the Underdark? I've always heard stories, but never thought I'd end up slumming it down here."
Astarion,"So, what do you need, oh loyal follower of Shar?"
Astarion,"No, they were your -... never mind. You made your choice."
Astarion,It seems ignorance truly is bliss. I don't know if I'm horrified or jealous.
Astarion,"All your past, just wiped clean. I don't know if I'm horrified or jealous."
Astarion,You really don't remember the last while? You don't remember killing anyone?
Astarion,"Once his kind has you under their thumb, they won't ever let you go."
Astarion,"Useful as the hammer would have been, I'm relieved we're not in the devil's debt."
Astarion,I thought we were going to see some real sparks fly between Wyll and Karlach.
Astarion,"To think, Gale's had this devastating orb within himself the entire time, but only just mentioned it?"
Astarion,And it's a powerful weapon to boot? Things are starting to look very interesting...
Astarion,"If the gith are looking for that artefact, then we may have something valuable on our hands."
Astarion,"If your people are looking for that artefact, then we may have something valuable on our hands."
Astarion,Good to see Gale's willing to do what it takes to get power. Even if it means defying the gods themselves.
Astarion,"If the gith are looking for that artefact of yours, then we may have something valuable on our hands."
Astarion,"The stink of oil, the clank of gears - this place is revolting."
Astarion,"So, Wyll did the right thing and it earned him a set of horns. Let that be a lesson to us all."
Astarion,"I see. So... pretty far, then?"
Astarion,"You're... you're not actually going to do it, are you?"
Astarion,"Oh, thank the gods. I was sure you were actually going to do it."
Astarion,"That being said - when you do explode, how far away should I be?"
Astarion,"You have been dealt a difficult hand, my friend. I'm sorry."
Astarion,"So, I couldn't help but overhear that your god's commanded you to - well... explode."
Astarion,I just hope he stays focused on battling Infernal forces. The undead have it hard enough already.
Astarion,"Just stay focused on slaying the Infernal, will you? The undead have it hard enough already."
Astarion,"So, the Blade of Frontiers is dead. Long live the Blade of Avernus."
Astarion,"You know, for all the sense of dread and horror seeping through this place, I really feel quite at home here."
Astarion,"Did you actually want something, or are you just here to spoil my fun?"
Astarion,"Is there a reason you're always such an utter drip? Do you have some sort of condition? Honestly, it's like you hate good news."
Astarion,"Exactly! Waste not, want not - even when it comes to mind flayer parasites. "
Astarion,Excellent!
Astarion,"Given our shared affliction, I suppose you had a similar dream...? "
Astarion,"I had the strangest dream last night. There was a visitor promising me protection, and all sorts of delicious powers from the parasites in our heads. "
Astarion,"I do admire the décor here. It's more tasty than tasteful, but I'll take what I can get. "
Astarion,"The Amulet of Bhaal. It's hardly a triumph of fashion, but it does have its uses."
Astarion,I hope she doesn't come to regret it.
Astarion,"So, Shadowheart chose her family over her god."
Astarion,Now there's a bloody devil trailing after us? This gets better and better.
Astarion,"Mystra has given you her blessing, I see. A reward for good behaviour."
Astarion,"So, we've picked up a wizard who managed to get stuck in his own portal? Hardly a promising introduction. "
Astarion,"I mean, I hate to judge the proverbial book, but that oaf may be all cover and no pages."
Astarion,Minsc puts on quite a show of brawn. Even if there's no brain worth mentioning.
Astarion,Your bald friend puts on quite a show of brawn. Even if there's no brain worth mentioning.
Astarion,"Well, no tentacles yet. I suppose we can consider that a success."
Astarion,"Then again, you'd have to be mad to spend your days marching through this gloom."
Astarion,That drider's mad as a box of gremishkas.
Astarion,"It's quite a trick, coming back from the dead. If only we were all so lucky."
Astarion,"Plus, I appreciate anyone who opens a conversation with threats of bodily harm."
Astarion,"Not that I want to get on the wrong side of any devils, but this Karlach is a survivor."
Astarion,"I knew we were a strange band, but a fugitive from the Hells? Now that's someone worth knowing."
Astarion,Who'd keep a secret like that from his friends? You can't trust anyone these days.
Astarion,"To think, he's had that orb within him this whole time and never told us."
Astarion,Not for his wit or wisdom - he'll just make an excellent shield if we're attacked. 
Astarion,I think I'll enjoy travelling with Halsin.
Astarion,"Well, it's a 'run down, bearing the weight of centuries' sort of grand. Which is my favourite kind, incidentally."
Astarion,What a waste - Gale could have had a taste of real power. 
Astarion,"A pity, really - you could have tasted some real power. But what do I know? I'm sure Mystra's boon is lovely."
Astarion,Instead he bowed to the will of his god and traded it for a sad little boon. Pathetic.
Astarion,"So, we owe our lack of tentacles to one of the very creatures that kidnapped us."
Astarion,And who knows? Maybe we'll have better luck with our next weapon of incomprehensible destruction. 
Astarion,I knew it! There's no shame in being curious about power. It is exhilarating.
Astarion,"Fair. Rude, but fair. "
Astarion,Or... maybe it will? I honestly have no idea with you people. 
Astarion,"Gods, lighten up. Enjoy a joke, it won't kill you."
Astarion,"Some people just don't appreciate the wonders the world has to hold, I suppose."
Astarion,Really? Where's your sense of curiosity?
Astarion,"Come on, you can't say you weren't a little curious to see what would happen?"
Astarion,"Still, let's hope it doesn't come to that!"
Astarion,Obviously I'm glad we didn't level the monastery with that sun cannon. But...
Astarion,"They do! Honestly, that man..."
Astarion,"And maybe this will help him relate to you a little better. You're both sporting horns now, after all."
Astarion,"Of course not, darling! You mustn't blame yourself."
Astarion,Not that they don't look flattering on him. Almost everything does.
Astarion,Poor Wyll gave you the benefit of the doubt and it earned him a set of horns.
Astarion,And now it's offering us power. If we're willing to 'evolve'.
Astarion,At least you showed it what you thought of its offer. Nicely done.
Astarion,At least my lack of tentacles. I'm not sure what's next for you.
Astarion,"So, we're travelling with the famed 'Blade of Frontiers'. I feel safer already."
Astarion,That's the spirit! Chin up and all that.
Astarion,"Now, was there anything else you wanted? "
Astarion,"You're right, I don't understand. You have a choice, but it sounds like you're actually considering this."
Astarion,Then find a way to avoid it.
Astarion,Must you? Does Gale's will not come into it?
Astarion,"Well, what's next? Are you actually going through with this?"
Astarion,"I do rather like that, you know."
Astarion,Delicious...
Astarion,There is nothing I'd like more.
Astarion,How could I say no?
Astarion,Can't get enough? I'm not surprised.
Astarion,You don't have to ask. But I'm glad you did.
Astarion,"Oh, my love."
Astarion,So that's why your blood tasted so foul - this magic you're harbouring.
Astarion,"Tell me I misheard, Gale. Because how would that make sense? How would that even be possible?"
Astarion,"And in this case, they're enemies we might not see coming until it's too late."
Astarion,I don't like getting caught between the Guild and the Zhentarim. You always make enemies when you take sides in a struggle like that.
Astarion,I hope it was the right call.
Astarion,"So, you persuaded Lae'zel to stay true to Vlaakith? To keep loving her chains."
Astarion,"So, you persuaded Lae'zel to stay true to your queen? To keep loving your chains."
Astarion,"Oh no, my friend. I have my own plans."
Astarion,"You are perfect, every time."
Astarion,"Anything for you, my darling."
Astarion,"Oh, I can refuse you nothing."
Astarion,"Just don't stray too far. But you'd never dream of doing that, would you?"
Astarion,Why would I need to? You're going to be wonderfully obedient.
Astarion,"As much as I wish to sequester you in a deep chamber of my palace and keep you all to myself, there's much to be done."
Astarion,First we'll take Baldur's Gate. Then we'll take the world. 
Astarion,"We'll dominate it until the sun itself melts, and then we'll give ourselves to the night."
Astarion,"Of course I will, and you'll drink mine. I can't wait to taste your lips after you've tasted me."
Astarion,Oh?
Astarion,And can you blame me? You've hardly proven you're deserving of trust.
Astarion,"So, you decided to stay true to Vlaakith? To keep loving your chains."
Astarion,Love? I don't remember love.
Astarion,"I hope we can agree on that. Until then, I'll give you some space."
Astarion,"We're going to find to the Heart of the Absolute to help ourselves, not be sacrificed on the altar for some god."
Astarion,"It would be nice not to have to rely on you as my great protector, but... well, I do appreciate the thought."
Astarion,"I want you by my side as well. Now that you're free, we can craft a new future together."
Astarion,"Gods, yes. I've been waiting so long for this."
Astarion,And it was absolutely worth the wait.
Astarion,"How could I say no? You are my favourite, after all."
Astarion,But of course. You deserve a treat.
Astarion,"We all have our secrets, indeed."
Astarion,"Well, this seems like a lovely little spot. The sense of impending doom aside."
Astarion,"Still, it's good to know she's more likely to attack you face on, rather than stabbing you in the back."
Astarion,"So, Lae'zel is a killer. Hardly surprising for your people."
Astarion,"Come on, let's finish this. "
Astarion,We're not done yet.
Astarion,"Gods, that was close. I could almost kiss the boards here, but - well that would be disgusting. "
Astarion,"Hardly a luxurious setting, but it definitely has its upsides for a vampire."
Astarion,"You know, for all the time I've spent lurking in the shadows, I've never ventured into the Underdark before."
Astarion,"I was always more of a 'lurker in', historically."
Astarion,I never saw myself as a banisher of shadows before.
Astarion,"I don't know if Faerûn needed another hero, but Wyll seems happy. I suppose that counts for something."
Astarion,"I don't know if Faerûn needs another hero, but you seem happy. I suppose that counts for something."
Astarion,It seems the Blade of Frontiers' legend will only grow from here.
Astarion,There's a definite touch of the mythic to this place.
Astarion,"I mean, of course I'll support you. I'd just rather do it from a distance. Because of the... explosion."
Astarion,"I'm sorry - me? Oh no, no I don't think so."
Astarion,"Yes, well... I'll leave you to your thoughts. Just - I'll give you space."
Astarion,As much space as I possibly can.
Astarion,Maybe I should just - I'll give you some space.
Astarion,"But you need time to think, so I'll leave you be - give you some space."
Astarion,"I've known people who were hungry for power, but Gale takes it a bit too literally for my liking."
Astarion,I wonder how he does it. Why he does it.
Astarion,"I'm sure all will be revealed in time, but I don't like it. A waste of perfectly good treasure. "
Astarion,"I know he'll explode if he doesn't, but still. It hurts to see valuable treasure just slurped up."
Astarion,"I don't know if it's the bats or the decaying... everything, but it's quite homey."
Astarion,There certainly is a strong ambience down here.
Astarion,I wonder if she bit the head off her mate after they'd done the deed.
Astarion,I'm amazed you're still in one piece; I thought she'd bite your head off when she was done with you.
Astarion,"So, Minthara has one in the proverbial oven?"
Astarion,"For what it's worth, I rather like your new look. It adds a sense of drama - a little more flair."
Astarion,Are we sure we want to find him before Nine Fingers does? I doubt he'll be pleased to see us.
Astarion,"So, this 'Stone Lord' is the legendary Minsc? And a newly-minted cultist, no less."
Astarion,"So, the gith is a killer. Hardly surprising for their people."
Astarion,"When the devils start approaching you, you know you're in deep."
Astarion,I don't relish the idea of your devil visiting our camp - let alone offering us anything resembling a 'deal'.
Astarion,"We all have our little quirks, after all. I'm sure all will be revealed in good time."
Astarion,"But of course, I wouldn't want to pry."
Astarion,"That will make for a very interesting evening, I'm sure."
Astarion,"Still, we all have our little quirks. I'm sure we'll come to appreciate them in time."
Astarion,I can imagine.
Astarion,Do you often burst into flames or was that a special occasion? 
Astarion,"I'm sorry, but what in the literal Hells was that?"
Astarion,I don't relish the idea of Mizora visiting our camp - let alone offering us anything resembling a 'deal'.
Astarion,"Hello again. Still alive, I see. "
Astarion,"I saw you on the ship. You're in league with them, aren't you? Those tentacled - argh."
Astarion,They - they killed me! At least you had the good grace to bring me back.
Astarion,Over here...
Astarion,Shall we?
Astarion,Over there.
Astarion,Watch your back.
Astarion,Watch the shadows.
Astarion,One step at a time.
Astarion,Subtle steps.
Astarion,Try not to waste it.
Astarion,Let's waste a spell - why not?
Astarion,Just try not to die.
Astarion,How did you last so long without me?
Astarion,Do not waste this.
Astarion,"Someone needs help, I see."
Astarion,"Yes, all right."
Astarion,A little help.
Astarion,"All right, here."
Astarion,Don't waste this.
Astarion,Tread lightly.
Astarion,Tread carefully.
Astarion,Step lightly.
Astarion,"Yes, let's."
Astarion,You're the only one. Other people don't have a heart like you. You're you. No one is like that.
Astarion,No one ever looked out for me. No one ever said a kind thing to me.
Astarion,What does it matter? There's only six of them. And they are vampire spawn. 
Astarion,"What a mess. Well, at least you've met my family now."
Astarion,"And when he doesn't need you anymore? What then, sister?"
Astarion,"I can. I can stop him, but you have to tell me what you know."
Astarion,"It wouldn't be the worst thing he's ever done to us. You know I'm right, sister."
Astarion,You haven't spent much time with my family.
Astarion,You clearly need some help.
Astarion,Attack.
Astarion,It's a lie - Cazador would never share power with us.
Astarion,I'm not going anywhere with you.
Astarion,"Listen to me, this ritual of Cazador's - we're part of it. He's going to sacrifice us all!"
Astarion,What ritual? What are you talking about?
Astarion,What if we joined together? Fought Cazador together?
Astarion,"I can beat Cazador. Follow me, help me complete the ritual, and I'll set you free."
Astarion,And if I refuse to come?
Astarion,"You can teleport now? Cazador doesn't want to lose anyone else, I suppose. "
Astarion,"All right, let's go home."
Astarion,"You say, as a mind flayer thrall who spends their life sorting out other people's problems."
Astarion,Waste of a spell.
Astarion,I should let it fester.
Astarion,From the shadows.
Astarion,They won't see me coming.
Astarion,Won't know what bit 'em.
Astarion,Surprise.
Astarion,Slowly...
Astarion,Nice and easy...
Astarion,Yes...
Astarion,Let's give someone a surprise.
Astarion,Let's chat.
Astarion,There they are.
Astarion,Time for a chat.
Astarion,Time to talk.
Astarion,They can't even die efficiently.
Astarion,Of course they need help.
Astarion,What did I do to deserve this?
Astarion,Why am I not surprised?
Astarion,"Yes yes, I'll save you."
Astarion,Ugh. Fine.
Astarion,Naturally.
Astarion,I've seen rocks with more charm.
Astarion,Just avoid big words.
Astarion,Do I have to touch them?
Astarion,What's this?
Astarion,It's mine now.
Astarion,Well hello.
Astarion,A little souvenir.
Astarion,Let's have it.
Astarion,Into my pocket...
Astarion,Now? Really?
Astarion,Just don't bleed on me.
Astarion,Let's get it over with.
Astarion,Ugh.
Astarion,All right. Fine.
Astarion,Sure. Why not?
Astarion,My daily penance.
Astarion,Don't get too close.
Astarion,I'll try to use small words.
Astarion,Remember: speak slowly.
Astarion,Try not to confuse them.
Astarion,Must we?
Astarion,Must I?
Astarion,"I'm doing this for you, too, you know. To make sure we're both safe. Forever, for good."
Astarion,"Ah, don't sell yourself so short."
Astarion,"Whatever's in here, it might give me an edge over Cazador. Or free me from him entirely."
Astarion,Although I can't make any progress as long as those spirits remember their mission. It seems to be all they know.
Astarion,"Still. If nothing else, maybe I can beat Cazador to death with it."
Astarion,"Whatever's in here, it might give me an edge over my old master Cazador. Or free me from him entirely."
Astarion,"Trust me, the spirits won't be any kinder to you. As long as they remember their duty to protect this book, no one's getting in."
Astarion,"Anyway, I'd rather keep it where I can see it. Its time will come, I'm sure."
Astarion,No! There's something in here - I know it.
Astarion,"I wouldn't be trying to reason with them if 'murder' was an option, would I?"
Astarion,They're too strong for that. They must be hiding something good.
Astarion,Perhaps. But would that damage the tome itself?
Astarion,I can't risk it. There's something valuable in here.
Astarion,"Thank you, very helpful. But I can't risk it. There's something valuable in here."
Astarion,I only read one page before their maddening whispers drove me away.
Astarion,I barely opened it when they started whispering from the shadows.
Astarion,"I can't. I feel a connection with it, but the spirits within fight me at every step."
Astarion,What? No. I - I'm fine.
Astarion,"No, I won't kill them! Well, maybe Wyll..."
Astarion,"It's a book of necromancy, full of secrets about controlling the dead, returning the dead to life, and who knows what else."
Astarion,"But still, we live in hope. Figuratively speaking."
Astarion,"As long as those spirits remember their mission, I doubt it. Keeping the book safe is all they know."
Astarion,And I should rest. This has all been a lot.
Astarion,Probably not. He has to rest in his crypt during the day. I've never known him to leave Baldur's Gate.
Astarion,But he has no end of lackeys. He'll send someone else in his place.
Astarion,"Trust me, he's like nothing you've handled before."
Astarion,What? No - not you.
Astarion,I was just perusing this little find and - WILL YOU SHUT UP?!
Astarion,Forgive me. This book reads you more than you read it.
Astarion,"I mean it plays with your mind. There are secrets here, but the book has spirits. They fight you every step of the way."
Astarion,"No, there's something in here. But the voices - the spirits in the book won't let me see it."
Astarion,"No, I won't kill them! Well, maybe Shadowheart..."
Astarion,I almost reached the end before they drove me out. And drove me all but mad.
Astarion,"Now every time I open it, the voices surge back into my mind. I can't reason with them - they exist to protect that book."
Astarion,No! He's not eating this one. It's too valuable.
Astarion,No! You're not eating this one. It's too valuable.
Astarion,"Generous, but I'd prefer to keep it. It may be rather valuable."
Astarion,Maybe. Maybe not. It's hard to know what's lurking in here.
Astarion,Someone went through a lot of trouble to protect this tome. It has to be something more than a book of cantrips.
Astarion,"Still, I doubt this will help us with our parasites. Maybe it's better to put it aside for now."
Astarion,"Indeed. As long as the spirits remember their mission, the book is a lost cause."
Astarion,I got deep into the pages of this book before they drove me out. And almost drove me mad.
Astarion,But... perhaps there's something in what you say.
Astarion,Quick step.
Astarion,"Very well, then. Die if you want to, I will carry on regardless."
Astarion,"Ugh. Well, I suppose you knew we could defeat them. I'll try not to think what would have happened if we hadn't."
Astarion,"For what it's worth, thank you. No matter what happens down there, you helped me stand up against him."
Astarion,Concerned? Do you know the power a vampire lord possesses?
Astarion,"Yes. They cannot fight his compulsion. But I can, thanks to our wriggling friend."
Astarion,"Easy to say the words, isn't it?"
Astarion,"How good of you to say, darling."
Astarion,"No, he didn't. I am still here. And I will fight him until I fight my last."
Astarion,But to steal his life's work... that might be something.
Astarion,Be sure to mention that if he saunters into our camp tonight. That'll save your neck.
Astarion,Nothing can make up for that. Not even Cazador's death.
Astarion,So don't you ever judge me for doing what Cazador ordered.
Astarion,"A year of silence. Months of scratching my hands raw, trying to carve my way out. More months of not moving at all. Months wishing only for death."
Astarion,"Once - in the first decade of my slavery - I found a darling boy who I couldn't bear to bring back to him. So I ran, instead of hurting that sweet man."
Astarion,You don't know what it was like. There was no way out.
Astarion,He wouldn't throw away centuries of planning on a scrap like this. They were pulled back just in time.
Astarion,Everything has changed. What matters now is that I can stand up to Cazador.
Astarion,I'm glad you know. 
Astarion,You don't understand. You don't know him.
Astarion,At least you've met my family now.
Astarion,"I can't tell whether you're a bad liar or a worse jester, but either way, it isn't cute."
Astarion,We can probably make an exception for Minsc. Probably...
Astarion,"As much as I'd love to present his head to Vlaakith, you don't know what he's like."
Astarion,"This needs to end, one way or another."
Astarion,Thank you for your unerring support.
Astarion,Just trust me when I say we need to be careful. He'll send more lackeys - he has plenty of souls to command.
Astarion,We just have to be vigilant. Keep our wits about us. And kill any monster hunters on sight.
Astarion,"What a lovely invitation, but I'm afraid I'll have to decline. I intend to kill him, you see?"
Astarion,You think he's ever kept a promise? He will never let us be free... You all know that.
Astarion,"Vengeance will taste sweet, paired with Ascension. "
Astarion,"I will miss you, though. Since the moment we met, you have been spectacular."
Astarion,Why should we let Cazador have all the fun? After all he's done to us.
Astarion,I'm doing what I have to... I can't be what you want to see in me.
Astarion,Don't look at me like that. With the sweet little 'disappointed I'm not getting cuddly Astarion' pout. I can't take it. I can't be what you want to see in me.
Astarion,"The Rite of Profane Ascension will be mine, and he won't see a scrap of its glory. I am going to complete the ritual as the Ascendant, and then I am going to kill him."
Astarion,You want to see him dead.
Astarion,"After these centuries of torment, I know what you all want. More than power. More than to walk in the sun."
Astarion,We can probably make an exception for Wyll. Probably...
Astarion,"Oh, I'm well aware of what the master needs. But don't we deserve better?"
Astarion,Get the hells away from me!
Astarion,Don't spoil this for me. I almost had them -
Astarion,"Can you summon the dead? Bring them back? Can you - ugh, can you shut up and let me read?"
Astarion,"Yes, I'll free you."
Astarion,You're too pretty to die.
Astarion,The element of surprise.
Astarion,Gently...
Astarion,Stay low.
Astarion,Not a sound.
Astarion,Stepping softly.
Astarion,And who knows - maybe this is what's best? The kind of power that ritual offered could ruin a person. Even me.
Astarion,Silent as the grave.
Astarion,Quietly...
Astarion,There's always something.
Astarion,"Gods, I would have liked to kill him, though."
Astarion,I will have to trust you on that.
Astarion,"You know, on some level, it does."
Astarion,A poor investment.
Astarion,Don't bleed on me.
Astarion,Let's not waste any blood.
Astarion,Let's lay on hands.
Astarion,"No, no - that won't do."
Astarion,Move unseen.
Astarion,Step carefully.
Astarion,Nice and easy.
Astarion,Come on. Don't let them see you bleed.
Astarion,You're familiar with the phrase 'better the devil you know'?
Astarion,"First you kill me, then you bring me back? What do you want, exactly?"
Astarion,What do you mean 'dead'? How? Why?!
Astarion,Free? I'm not free - I'm trapped! 
Astarion,I'll never be anything but a spawn now. You've sentenced me to an eternity in darkness.
Astarion,"Tell me honestly, did you kill him for my sake or to stop me completing the ritual myself?"
Astarion,I - ...I do believe you. I know you only did what you thought was best for me.
Astarion,On tippy toes.
Astarion,The kiss of life.
Astarion,Time for discretion.
Astarion,Like a wraith.
Astarion,"Be very, very quiet."
Astarion,Let's prowl.
Astarion,Don't just stand there - get me up!
Astarion,Help me!
Astarion,What are you staring at?
Astarion,This doesn't feel right.
Astarion,This is all your fault.
Astarion,Neither seen nor heard.
Astarion,"I'm glad to hear it. Whatever's coming, we need to keep our options open."
Astarion,Stay strong!
Astarion,"I swear, if you just die..."
Astarion,If this isn't important...
Astarion,I was trying to concentrate.
Astarion,Time to kill?
Astarion,Time for a little death?
Astarion,Keep your blade close.
Astarion,Hello you.
Astarion,Ready.
Astarion,Quietly now...
Astarion,I'm just waiting.
Astarion,Something smells tasty.
Astarion,Bamboozle them.
Astarion,They won't expect this.
Astarion,Won't see this coming.
Astarion,Do the unexpected.
Astarion,Hurry...
Astarion,"Let's not waste any more blood, hmm?"
Astarion,"Shhh, it's all right."
Astarion,Now what...
Astarion,Really? Now?
Astarion,Quiet...
Astarion,Mmm?
Astarion,"They - they were alive? All this time, they were just hidden under the palace?"
Astarion,"Hells. After two centuries, Cazador still had new horrors to reveal. "
Astarion,"Fine, here!"
Astarion,"Just try to survive, will you?"
Astarion,"All right, I'm coming!"
Astarion,"Fine, I'll free you."
Astarion,Let's get you loose.
Astarion,Oh for goodness' sake.
Astarion,Do not let me down.
Astarion,Because I've nothing better to do.
Astarion,"Good morning, beautiful."
Astarion,"Come on, wake up."
Astarion,You're too cute to die.
Astarion,Time to wake up.
Astarion,Wakey wakey.
Astarion,Did I say you could die?
Astarion,"Come on, up you get."
Astarion,"There are cozier beds, you know."
Astarion,Typical!
Astarion,I'll get you loose.
Astarion,"Yes, that's an option. But I wouldn't bet eternity on it."
Astarion,"It's grim either way, so why not sell what's left of my soul to a devil? Better he has it than Cazador."
Astarion,Tell me about this hunter - he obviously wasn't a vampire. 
Astarion,"Was he dragonborn? An orc? Something ferocious, surely?"
Astarion,A Gur? A monster-hunting vagabond. His people are the reason I'm like this.
Astarion,It was a group of Gur that attacked me that night in Baldur's Gate. I would've died had Cazador not appeared and saved me.
Astarion,"I thought so! Not that it matters, I trust you've taken care of it."
Astarion,But why send anyone after me? I'm hardly a threat out here.
Astarion,I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Cazador always had a twisted sense of humour.
Astarion,I'd trust a devil over a vampire any day. I think he likes us.
Astarion,Am I not the very definition of 'careful'?
Astarion,"Fret not, my soul is quite safe. I am not about to swap one master for another."
Astarion,"This is the first chance I've had to decipher my scars. Be a dear, don't get in my way."
Astarion,"Not anymore. Which is all that matters, really."
Astarion,So it would seem.
Astarion,Hopefully he bumps into some gnolls while stumbling around at night and that's the last we hear from him.
Astarion,Then we kill him. I thought that would've been obvious.
Astarion,"There may be others, of course. If Cazador sent one peon after me, he'll send more."
Astarion,"He was. But now he's not, which is all that matters, really."
Astarion,Why? Because Cazador sent him - why else?
Astarion,"But trust me, whoever these Gur are - Cazador has a hand in it. This hunter was a message."
Astarion,Or killing. Whichever is more effective.
Astarion,"Ulma? I don't know the name, but she might be worth talking to."
Astarion,"Let's get you up, dear."
Astarion,Enough lying about.
Astarion,"Hardly the place, darling."
Astarion,Up you get.
Astarion,"No, I won't kill them! Well, maybe the gith..."
Astarion,There's life in you yet.
Astarion,Heavens forbid. We're all entitled to our secrets.
Astarion,"No, I won't kill them! Well, maybe Gale..."
Astarion,"Well of course he did. 'I'm hunting a poor innocent for money' isn't exactly going to win sympathy, is it?"
Astarion,I can't. I won't. Now - stop!
Astarion,I forbid you from dying.
Astarion,"Come on, get up!"
Astarion,The cavalry is here.
Astarion,Something different.
Astarion,Magnificent.
Astarion,This should work.
Astarion,We'll try this.
Astarion,A fine choice.
Astarion,Let. Me. Go! Ah... Hello.
Astarion,"Figuring out what's happening to us, confronting a god called 'the Absolute', and then finding the time to kill my old master before he can control me once more?"
Astarion,"No, 'I'm here to save you from a monstrous vampire' - that's much more convincing."
Astarion,It seems Cazador wants me back.
Astarion,"No one's going to win, because there won't be a fight."
Astarion,I won't be caught and dragged back like some animal.
Astarion,"When I return to Baldur's Gate, it will be on my terms. And if I can't trust you to help me, then I'll figure it out myself."
Astarion,"I deserve better than anything that bounty hunter has planned for me, I promise you that."
Astarion,I've only been looking after us. That Gur hunter... he's passed by our camp once or twice in the darkness.
Astarion,I know! Wasn't it impressive?
Astarion,He won't bother us anymore. Now I've made sure of it.
Astarion,"Aren't you just obsessed? And here I am, not even trying."
Astarion,"Oh, well, next time we can land the killing blow, together. It will be a bonding moment."
Astarion,We're not wandering these wilds looking for stimulating conversations. Of course my knife was ready.
Astarion,"The Gur are duplicitous. I've had my share of run-ins, so caution is only natural."
Astarion,"If Halsin is right, the person that's been playing games with the worms in our skulls."
Astarion,"I don't know who they are, but I have plenty of questions."
Astarion,Who knows? Drow? Mind flayers? Death? Hopefully not ours.
Astarion,"But maybe answers, if we can convince the right people to talk. "
Astarion,"I won't lie, it's tempting. If I keep the tadpole, I risk transforming into a grotesque monster."
Astarion,"If I lose the tadpole, Cazador has control of me, body and soul, and I return to the shadows."
Astarion,"If he can find me, anyone can. You've left me exposed."
Astarion,Fair? Nothing about this is fair. Least of all what you've done.
Astarion,"You go to bed as normal, I'll take first watch tonight. And if he appears, I'll be happy to take care of him."
Astarion,"Besides, this is... personal. It's better if I handle it alone."
Astarion,"Ah, yes, you don't know. Cazador is a - a slaver in Baldur's Gate."
Astarion,He captured me a long time ago. Insisted I call him 'master' - I only escaped when the mind flayers snatched me away from him.
Astarion,I shouldn't be surprised Cazador's hunting me. He always was quite... obsessive.
Astarion,He did. This 'Ulma' might be worth talking to.
Astarion,Or killing. They're both good options.
Astarion,"But trust me, whoever the hunter thought he was working for, Cazador was pulling the strings. Only he would know to send the Gur after me."
Astarion,"It was him, I'm sure. Only he would know to send the Gur after me."
Astarion,"I'm not happy about it either, you know. Especially for one of them to turn up."
Astarion,I didn't do anything! I was kidnapped - just like you.
Astarion,"Oh, there'll be others. I'm sure of that."
Astarion,"I appreciate your loyalty, darling, but I don't think you understand. My old master sent that vagabond after me."
Astarion,Give me strength.
Astarion,Of course they're trapped.
Astarion,It was a mob of Gur that left me half-dead two hundred years ago. That left me begging Cazador to turn me so I could survive to take revenge.
Astarion,"And if that old bastard wants me back, he won't ask whose side you're on before slaughtering you."
Astarion,Let's keep to the shadows.
Astarion,What? Why? Why would you do that?!
Astarion,"A sweet thought, but if he approaches a half-empty camp, he'll know something's wrong and bolt."
Astarion,"If Cazador sent one peon after me, he'll send another."
Astarion,Up! We need you.
Astarion,"Come on, come on. What are you hiding?"
Astarion,"First, we have to - uh..."
Astarion,"Ha! All right, fair enough."
Astarion,"Not everyone lusts for blood, darling. Or could be cursed to an eternity in the shadows if they lose their brain parasite."
Astarion,"Ah! What the hells are you - wait, did you say Infernal?"
Astarion,Some day that soft heart of yours is going to be torn out of your chest.
Astarion,I don't know. Not that.
Astarion,It sounds like death would be a mercy. Let's deliver it.
Astarion,But you can read it? You can tell me what it says?
Astarion,Never mind. It's not your concern.
Astarion,"Yes, but you can read it? You can tell me what it says?"
Astarion,Of course not. Why would I expect anything else?
Astarion,"Still, you're not the only person in the world that can read Infernal. I'll do this on my own. As I always do."
Astarion,Very true. This is nothing to concern yourself with.
Astarion,Did you not get enough of an eyeful back with Raphael?
Astarion,Although you can read Infernal...
Astarion,"Well... you do lust for blood, but you know what I mean. "
Astarion,My point is you didn't have to choose this.
Astarion,"Well, if you insist on loving and adoring me, I guess I'll have to allow it."
Astarion,"Well, perhaps there was a smidge of doubt. I do come with my complications."
Astarion,What damned language is this?
Astarion,I - F - or is it an E? Is it even a letter?
Astarion,"I admit, I was curious, but it's hardly your concern. I'm happy to do this alone."
Astarion,"I - this isn't your problem, you know."
Astarion,No! Wait - here.
Astarion,All right then.
Astarion,...That had better be a joke.
Astarion,I can't read it with a mirror and it seems I can't read it with my hands either.
Astarion,So... I was wondering if maybe - perhaps - you might be able to...
Astarion,Can you read what's on my damned back? Please.
Astarion,It's a sonnet about minding your own damn business.
Astarion,"You know, darling, I think we are going to have a lot of fun together."
Astarion,I - I suppose it couldn't hurt.
Astarion,I don't need help. And certainly not from you.
Astarion,"Now, if you don't mind - piss off."
Astarion,Peace at last.
Astarion,"Oh, it's you. Well, I'm glad you like them."
Astarion,"A gift from Cazador, written in flesh. I think it says 'mind your own damn business'."
Astarion,"A gift from Cazador, written in flesh. Apparently it's a poem, but I've never read it. "
Astarion,"Ah! There you are. I admit, I got curious."
Astarion,Ah! It's you. 
Astarion,It's my back. My skin. My business.
Astarion,"...I have no idea. I've been trying to trace the words, but they may as well be written in Rashemi."
Astarion,"Not exactly a resounding declaration of love, but... maybe that's for the best."
Astarion,"Oh, I can do interesting. It's everything else that worries me."
Astarion,They beat me to death's door when Cazador appeared. He chased them off and offered to save me. To give me eternal life.
Astarion,"You know, I was just thinking about you. Remembering our little encounter in the night."
Astarion,"Given that my choices were 'eternal life' or 'bleed to death on the street', I took him up on the offer."
Astarion,It was only afterwards I realised just how long 'eternity' could be.
Astarion,Why do you insist on exhuming the past?
Astarion,"I was a slave, a vampire spawn, kept by the Szarr family."
Astarion,"The very same. It obviously put me off your neck, but now I can't help but wonder how the others taste."
Astarion,"You can rest easy, I don't intend a repeat performance. Although I do wonder how the others might taste."
Astarion,Perhaps I still am. I was never able to resist their commands.
Astarion,But now I've been conveniently lost. They won't ever control me again.
Astarion,It's simple. Just find a vampire that will drink your blood and turn you into a vampire spawn: their obedient puppet.
Astarion,"Not that anyone's volunteered, it's just an idle fancy."
Astarion,"In theory, the next step is to drink their blood. Once you've done that, you're free and a true vampire."
Astarion,People think the biggest threat to a vampire is a cleric with a stake. It's not.
Astarion,"No, that's the thing. I can't quite figure them out."
Astarion,"We still need them. That doesn't stop me from wondering, of course."
Astarion,"The biggest threat to a vampire is another vampire. They're scheming, paranoid, power-hungry beasts."
Astarion,"I couldn't make out much the first time I tried, but I recognised that jagged Hells-script. Hence, approaching Raphael."
Astarion,"I was attacked. A gang of vagrants, a tribe of wandering 'Gur', took issue with a ruling I'd made."
Astarion,"I've been wearing these scars for so many years, I started to feel around back there. Try to figure out what poem Cazador cut into me."
Astarion,"I can't remember much, truth be told. Centuries of torment will do that to you."
Astarion,I realise now I've never really had anyone. Not really. Nothing that compares to you.
Astarion,But you're serious about this? About... us?
Astarion,Although I've been able to make out exactly none of this on my own...
Astarion,"I thought maybe if I could read them myself, we wouldn't have to play whatever game that devil's concocting, but it's no use."
Astarion,Five seconds into this relationship and I already want to break up with you.
Astarion,"Still, if you insist on adoring me, then who am I to stop you?"
Astarion,"I do hate that he just... revealed everything to you, by the way. I would have liked to tell you in my own time. "
Astarion,Approximately... zero words? Thereabouts.
Astarion,All right. Let's see what happens.
Astarion,"Well, hello. What can I do for you?"
Astarion,In my own time.
Astarion,I'm not one to drop my guard and trust the first person who flounces up to me after we crash out of the sky.
Astarion,Yes?
Astarion,"Oh, what's to tell? I'm a magistrate back in the city - it's all rather tedious."
Astarion,What's to tell? I was sired by a vampire named Cazador.
Astarion,"Everything before that is so long ago it's ancient history. And everything that came after - well, I'd rather not reflect on it."
Astarion,"I'll know soon enough. The devil will deliver, once the price is right."
Astarion,"I was a magistrate, working to keep the peace in Baldur's Gate. Imprisoning trouble makers, that kind of thing."
Astarion,Need something?
Astarion,So why would any vampire give up control over a spawn to create a competitor?
Astarion,"It's - ah, well..."
Astarion,I was minding my own business. If only everyone was so considerate.
Astarion,"Relax, I've got you."
Astarion,Ha! Oh I shouldn't laugh.
Astarion,"More dangerous than you thought, perhaps. I've never had any doubt."
Astarion,"But if Cazador drew up a contract with someone in the Hells, then we need details from Raphael. There must be immense power on the line."
Astarion,"But if this is part of a contract, it must be powerful. Or valuable. Or both."
Astarion,"Cut a purse, then a throat."
Astarion,"It matters! It's carved into my back - whatever this is, it's part of me."
Astarion,No wonder he wants me back. What have I run off with...
Astarion,What have I run off with...
Astarion,Infernal? Are you sure? Can you show me?
Astarion,Let's fix you up.
Astarion,No more wasted blood.
Astarion,We need you strong.
Astarion,"And as you're my consort, that makes us the most powerful people in the world."
Astarion,"You know, now that our enemies have fallen, I might be the most powerful person in the world."
Astarion,Quick and quiet.
Astarion,What in the hells...
Astarion,What was that bastard up to?
Astarion,"Come on, let's move."
Astarion,I'll free you.
Astarion,Your hero is coming.
Astarion,I'm a vampire - forever young.
Astarion,What are you talking about? My skin isn't... is it?
Astarion,Really? Anything in particular?
Astarion,Is it? What do you see when you look at me?
Astarion,"The world is ours for the taking. So, what would you like?"
Astarion,"And neither would I. Together, we can do anything."
Astarion,And that makes us the most powerful couple in the world.
Astarion,Should be easy.
Astarion,What did he do to me?
Astarion,Hardly a challenge.
Astarion,A line with a fork and one - two - three dots?
Astarion,Bloody Infernal - how is anyone meant to read this garbage?
Astarion,"I am perfectly capable, thank you. This isn't your concern."
Astarion,Well find something else to gawp at. I'm busy and I don't need your help.
Astarion,"What? I - well, maybe you could have a look."
Astarion,And? What can you see?
Astarion,And? What does it say?
Astarion,An infernal pact? But not even the whole text?
Astarion,Simple.
Astarion,"Listen, we travel together, but we're not friends. I'm not about to share anything with someone I can't trust."
Astarion,"You really ended things with Lae'zel, just to be with me?"
Astarion,I have absolutely no idea. But it's no poem.
Astarion,"Then again, even he couldn't know I'd be kidnapped. Whatever he planned, it's gone wrong. Which gives us an advantage."
Astarion,If it's a poem at all...
Astarion,It's not a poem? That can't be good.
Astarion,What are these symbols? There must be something you can tell me about them?
Astarion,Why would he write a poem in Infernal? Why would he write anything in Infernal?
Astarion,It's a surprise. And Cazador's surprises are never good.
Astarion,Useless. Why do I even bother with you?
Astarion,"At least I still have the devil. He'll deliver, even if it's at a price."
Astarion,"I thought you could help me, but no - I'll have to make my own way. As usual. "
Astarion,Tell me what it says!
Astarion,"You sweetheart. But while you're here, maybe there's something else you could look at?"
Astarion,Ah! What are you doing?
Astarion,"Wait - I'm sorry. You caught me by surprise, that's all."
Astarion,"I've been tracing the scars on my back with my fingers, trying to read them by touch, but I can't. They may as well be written in Rashemi."
Astarion,"Good. This is personal and we're travelling companions, not friends. "
Astarion,"I - well, if you must know, I've been trying to make out the scars on my back."
Astarion,"I can't see them, so I've been trying to feel my way about, but they may as well be written in Rashemi."
Astarion,"Perplexed. This was a surprise, and Cazador's surprises are never good."
Astarion,"But what could a devil have offered Cazador? He had wealth, power, control - what more could you want?"
Astarion,I wasn't his only spawn. And he tortured us all - I imagine each of us are carrying a piece of this infernal contract.
Astarion,"I'm sure, but what will it say?"
Astarion,"No! No, let's keep this between ourselves. At least until we know what it means."
Astarion,"Two centuries carrying this, and I can finally see it."
Astarion,None at all...
Astarion,It doesn't look like a poem. It doesn't look like anything I recognise.
Astarion,I'm sure he can. A shame it took a deal with a devil to unravel this.
Astarion,"Still, I've made my bed with Raphael. We'll know soon enough."
Astarion,"Thank you. It never really occurred to me to ask for help, and - well..."
Astarion,"I suppose 'thank you' covered it, really. But I do mean it. I'm grateful - for all of this."
Astarion,"Not that there was any doubt - I was the obvious choice, but..."
Astarion,"When Cazador first carved this on me, I didn't fight back. I couldn't. I just knelt there as it happened to me."
Astarion,"Thank you, by the way. This may not be your fight exactly, but you're willing to help. That means a lot."
Astarion,"No. I could have missed it, of course, but I doubt it."
Astarion,Cazador was only figuratively hellish - there were never any devils hanging about the crypt.
Astarion,"Whatever he's left carved in my flesh, it's a mystery to me."
Astarion,"Thank you, by the way. This is... well, it's something."
Astarion,Will we? How... sweet.
Astarion,"Given the subject matter, I probably won't."
Astarion,Hells forbid.
Astarion,"But now that I'm free of him, now that I have a choice, I will do whatever it takes to fight. I'll pay any price to undo what he did to me."
Astarion,"...I don't know. If we kill his lackeys, he'll just send more."
Astarion,And why would they do that? Vampires are power-hungry creatures. They won't lose a servant to create a competitor.
Astarion,"Free and a true vampire, capable of creating my own coven? Yes."
Astarion,A Gur? One of those vagabonds? Why would they -
Astarion,"Ooh, I do so very like spicy food. "
Astarion,I'm not going to bite any of them. They don't seem as accommodating as you were.
Astarion,"I appreciate your restraint. It would have spoiled the mood - you were my first, after all."
Astarion,We delivered the devil. Now I want what I'm owed - we had a deal.
Astarion,"Even if I wanted to walk away from all of this, I can't. Cazador won't let me."
Astarion,Cazador. Of course he'd send a Gur to hunt me down.
Astarion,I'd appreciate a little less enthusiasm when it comes to Cazador and his horrors.
Astarion,Hmm...
Astarion,It's - nothing.
Astarion,"They're not special, they're just easy to buy and morally vacuous. Perfect lackeys."
Astarion,I was... contemplating. It's a lot to take in.
Astarion,What do you think I should do?
Astarion,"First, they make excellent monster hunters. So 'find a vampire spawn' sounds perfectly reasonable to them."
Astarion,The end of my life among them. Just when I was starting to enjoy it.
Astarion,How long do you think I can run? He has eternity to find me.
Astarion,He'll never leave me alone. I didn't think he would when I was just one more wretched toy for him to play with. 
Astarion,Spoil sport.
Astarion,"And Wyll? Well, I'm not quite sure. How do you think he'd taste?"
Astarion,Perish the thought - we're comrades in arms! I will be right behind you.
Astarion,"In that case, I'll leave fighting them to you. So I can observe your technique."
Astarion,What? Who? What happened?
Astarion,"And what is a 'mlar', exactly?"
Astarion,Back to Baldur's Gate?
Astarion,Back to Cazador. There's no other reason he'd want me alive.
Astarion,I like this bloodlust look on you. Very flattering.
Astarion,A brave choice.
Astarion,Cazador Szarr is a vampire lord in Baldur's Gate. The patriarch of his coven and a monster obsessed with power.
Astarion,"Oh, I'm flattered. Who knew you had such taste?"
Astarion,"Second, they're the reason I'm like this in the first place. It was a group of Gur that attacked me that night in Baldur's Gate."
Astarion,He turned me nearly two hundred years ago. I became his spawn and he became my tormentor.
Astarion,"Unfortunately, all this talk is getting me hungry. I'd better find something I can actually sink my teeth into."
Astarion,"No, and you're so charming and alluring. It's baffling, really."
Astarion,"I guess it shall remain a mystery, now and forevermore."
Astarion,Ha! Of course he'd send a Gur to hunt me down.
Astarion,"No one's getting killed, I swear. We're just two friends talking."
Astarion,But Shadowheart? I have no idea. How do you think our little enigma would taste?
Astarion,"Oh, I don't know. The screaming fever is pretty bad."
Astarion,"Ohh, that sounds very appealing. I'm almost convinced."
Astarion,You and I have very different definitions of 'clever'.
Astarion,Interesting. I always thought he'd taste a little too sweet.
Astarion,"But if I'm the key to this power he craves, he'll hunt me to the ends of Faerûn."
Astarion,I hate how right you are.
Astarion,Who knows - perhaps we've only just begun.
Astarion,Let's play doctor.
Astarion,He doesn't do simple plans. Not if he has a complex one that pits a dozen enemies against each other.
Astarion,"No, this hunter is a message. Cazador's letting me know that even out here, he can get to me. He wants me back."
Astarion,We'll patch you up.
Astarion,Maybe he wants to make an example of me. To show what happens to runaways.
Astarion,Go.
Astarion,"I will see you again, my love. I'm not sure how, but if I know anything, it's that death isn't always the end."
Astarion,Or maybe he thinks death is too good for me.
Astarion,"Wrong, I'm afraid. Bottom right."
Astarion,K'ha'ssji'trach'ash. The blighter is called K'ha'ssji'trach'ash.
Astarion,Safe? You think I'm safe?
Astarion,Do you know the power a vampire lord possesses?
Astarion,"Push the pain away, try to banish the memory."
Astarion,He can change shape; turn into mist; call wolves to do his bidding; shrug off blows like they're nothing.
Astarion,He could walk into our camp tonight and kill you with his bare hands. And you'd be lucky if death was the worst thing that happened to you.
Astarion,Do not resist. Let your mind wander as it will.
Astarion,"They may have no idea who they're working for. Cazador likely paid someone to pay someone to call in a favour, and here we are."
Astarion,The point is I have history with these barbarians. Cazador's sending a message.
Astarion,Karlach? I asked how are -... No. Not your engine. 
Astarion,Focus on the pain in your back - try to understand what he's carving.
Astarion,I knew he wouldn't leave me alone even when I was just another wretched toy for him to play with.
Astarion,The idea definitely has appeal.
Astarion,I could get rid of the worm in my head and still walk in the sun. I'd finally be free of the hunger.
Astarion,"And if I'm the key to this deal of Cazador's, perhaps I can turn this to my advantage..."
Astarion,"Well, he didn't mention the 'slave' clause at the time."
Astarion,I need to take the fight to him.
Astarion,And I need you to help me.
Astarion,"Once we deal with the tadpole, I'll be back to my nocturnal self. When you're being hunted by vampires, the dark is the worst place to hide."
Astarion,I would've died had Cazador not appeared and saved me.
Astarion,I need to deal with Cazador while I still have any kind of advantage over him.
Astarion,Do you think it's so simple?
Astarion,It's a lot to take in.
Astarion,And now he sends a Gur monster hunter for me? It's a message.
Astarion,"He's reminding me of his power. Even in the middle of nowhere, he can reach me. And he wants me back."
Astarion,I think you'll find I can. And there's nothing your bleeding heart can do to change my mind.
Astarion,Perhaps. He probably thought it was funny.
Astarion,"But more likely, he's trying to send me a message."
Astarion,Maybe. Maybe he was just drawn to the smell of blood.
Astarion,"If you won't risk taking him on for my sake, think of the innocent souls he'll sacrifice in this ritual."
Astarion,Trust me. It doesn't happen.
Astarion,Right... Good. Glad I asked.
Astarion,"You really ended things with her, just to be with me?"
Astarion,Aww.
Astarion,"Alas. It doesn't hurt to ponder the question, though."
Astarion,"You're a sweetheart, but you don't need to worry - I'm just thinking out loud."
Astarion,"Don't worry, there's enough of me to go around. I'm a man of tremendous appetites."
Astarion,"I don't think they'd volunteer, of course, but it doesn't make me any less curious."
Astarion,"Oh. Well, you would. Wouldn't you? It makes sense."
Astarion,Go right on with Halsin. Far be it from me to hold your hunger against you.
Astarion,"I'm all too familiar with Gale's blood, unfortunately. I can't recommend it."
Astarion,"Take Gale, for example. He strikes me as someone whose blood is rich, refined like a well-aged brandy."
Astarion,But Karlach? A tiefling seasoned by hellsfire? What could she possibly taste like?
Astarion,"Take Wyll, for example. A man of the people, very palatable, like a sweet cider."
Astarion,I trust you to make choices that are not going to hurt what we have.
Astarion,"Take Shadowheart, for example. She strikes me as having a heavy, enigmatic flavour - vintage port on two legs."
Astarion,"Honestly, so do I. What an adventure for you!"
Astarion,"After all this, I've realised it's all right if it does change. If anything changes."
Astarion,"Take Karlach, for example, her blood aged in the Hells. She's potent, like a fiery whiskey."
Astarion,You're lucky I'm such an open-minded person.
Astarion,"What hovel were you living in, that you didn't see this coming back in the grove? Honestly. But that's fine."
Astarion,Even jerky was meat once.
Astarion,You were delectable. And now I just can't help but wonder how the others taste.
Astarion,"In all these years, I've only ever fed on beasts. Drinking the blood of thinking creatures is a different thing entirely."
Astarion,"And I am very grateful. It did get me thinking about the others, though. How they might taste."
Astarion,"Although I'd settle for just killing the bastard. I wouldn't be a 'true' vampire, but I'd be free of him."
Astarion,We can't. And yet I crossed the threshold like moonlight through leaves.
Astarion,"There you are, I was just thinking about you. And that delicious moment we shared the other night."
Astarion,"This worm is a powerful little beast, isn't it?"
Astarion,Oh don't be so glum. Look at the power it's bringing us.
Astarion,"I can walk in sunlight, trespass upon any home, manipulate minds - there isn't another vampire in the Realms like me!"
Astarion,"What's not to enjoy? I can walk in sunlight, trespass upon any home, manipulate minds - I'm the most powerful vampire in the Realms!"
Astarion,The druid is unique. He has a lot of experience with this type of arrangement.
Astarion,"Granted, the looming doom is an issue, but why not enjoy the benefits while we can?"
Astarion,"Pity, you're tastier than you know. And you were my first."
Astarion,"Yes, I'm still rather tender, now that you mention it."
Astarion,"I admit, I may have been a little eager. But can you blame me? You were my first."
Astarion,I guessed. The man can't stay quiet about 'enjoying the freedom of Nature's gifts'. I bet he'd outlaw clothing if he could.
Astarion,I'm happy for you to have as much Halsin as you wish - but I do have one question.
Astarion,And I am deeply sorry. I was overeager - but can you blame me? You were my first.
Astarion,I know I was being foolish. But thank you for saying it.
Astarion,"I'm fairly sure the only one in the camp who hasn't is Withers, but even with him one can never be certain."
Astarion,"The very same. I've had this condition for two centuries, but truth be told? You were my first."
Astarion,"You really ended things with him, just to be with me?"
Astarion,But the gith? What in the hells would she taste like?
Astarion,"Thus, I'm sure it would be quite a harmless affair."
Astarion,"Well, this has been very useful, thank you."
Astarion,"Don't tempt me, darling."
Astarion,Walk freely? This place is as tight as a patriar's purse.
Astarion,Is there anything else? Any new and interesting ways you can waste my time?
Astarion,"My sweet, there is nothing I'd like more."
Astarion,No doubt they found me too intimidating.
Astarion,"Mmm, a meal that would put up a fight. An adventurous choice."
Astarion,"I'll come to you tonight, when you're snugly wrapped in your bedroll and we can have a little privacy."
Astarion,A fine choice. She is enticing.
Astarion,And this time I'll make sure I'm quiet - we don't want to disturb your rest.
Astarion,No problem. And what does this old brain look like?
Astarion,"Later on, when we are at rest, I will eat you right up. Just enough to give me strength, and just enough to leave you wishing for more."
Astarion,"Darling, I thought you'd never ask. I'll see you tonight."
Astarion,Then I'll see your delicious self tonight.
Astarion,"I was so hoping you'd say that. Until later, then."
Astarion,"Then I'll see you tonight, you sweet, generous thing."
Astarion,I was just wondering when you'd invite me back for a bite.
Astarion,Quite the opposite - I need someone I can trust. And now I know they'll never betray me.
Astarion,"Nothing out there will taste as good as the alternatives, but I'll make do. Sweet dreams."
Astarion,"There's nothing that tasty lurking out in the woods, but I'll make do. Sweet dreams."
Astarion,"Still, it's wise to keep our eyes open. I'm hardly the only monster around here."
Astarion,"Still, I am intrigued by the possibilities..."
Astarion,Absolutely. A mere thought experiment.
Astarion,"I can't forgive you, either. "
Astarion,"Relax, we're just talking."
Astarion,Just... don't make me think about it. Let's talk about something else. Anything else.
Astarion,Excuse me? Not every monster hunter we stumble across is trying to kill me.
Astarion,"So - in the spirit of theoretical questions - if you had to take a bite from one of them, who would it be?"
Astarion,"Then again, we're not exactly keeping a low profile out here."
Astarion,"Yes, heavens forbid we'd have an interesting conversation."
Astarion,"I do appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's try to restrain ourselves a little."
Astarion,I just mean a sip of their blood. No mastication required.
Astarion,What? I was only making conversation!
Astarion,"Fine, I'll bite. What did he look like?"
Astarion,"That's interesting, but not the kind of person I'd expect to be hunting me."
Astarion,"Honestly, you have no sense of fun."
Astarion,"Ah, a refined palate! I can't disagree."
Astarion,"Although the more I think on it, the hungrier I get. I'd better go find something I can actually get my teeth into."
Astarion,"We're having fun. I would say 'try it, it won't kill you', but in your case I'm not sure."
Astarion,"Oh no, don't be disgusting."
Astarion,Help is at hand.
Astarion,I know Cazador. And I'll take anything that saves me from that.
Astarion,Get back to killing.
Astarion,This is but the beginning.
Astarion,Our lives will never be the same again.
Astarion,The spawn? It won't take long to get a new army. I'll make new ones soon.
Astarion,I already hear the world whispering in sweet surrender.
Astarion,"Well... 'works' might be putting it a little strong, but... makes it feel less terrible, at least."
Astarion,"At last! Gods, this will feel good."
Astarion,"If you want 'healthy' advice, go talk to a druid. I'm just telling you what works."
Astarion,"It happens, my dear. Best not to dwell on it. Not if you can move on to the next conquest."
Astarion,Afterwards you felt empty? Alone? Ashamed?
Astarion,"We'd better rest, then. Tomorrow is going to be a busy, bloody day."
Astarion,"Gods, let her stay if she shuts the hells up."
Astarion,"So, what was it like? Tell me everything."
Astarion,"Good, I'm getting restless just sitting here. I need to do something."
Astarion,Gods - fine. We'll do it your way...
Astarion,"I'm sorry, was there anything else?"
Astarion,"Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. The very composition of my blood has been altered..."
Astarion,Well of course I'm jealous! It's not every day you can do a horizontal dance with a devil.
Astarion,Ssh. Hush. Feel what is in the air.
Astarion,"That will all happen in due time. But for now, patience is required. I hear the whispers of the night, but I can't yet speak its language."
Astarion,"
Really? Just like that? All right, but if she reaches for that lute, it's firewood."
Astarion,As long as she doesn't start serenading me. I've had enough of bad poets singing of my looks.
Astarion,It does sound divine. You'll have to catch me up on all the gory details later.
Astarion,Just remember to fetch me next time. I'd hate to think you were holding out on me.
Astarion,"So do I, I've never tried my hand at seducing a devil."
Astarion,"I'd be careful, little waif, we don't all play nicely."
Astarion,"That's the spirit, just keep moving forward. And hope the past never catches up to you. "
Astarion,"Well... no, not particularly. But it's better than facing up to it, at least."
Astarion,Apparently not yet. You still need to lose one of your hangers-on before we can face him.
Astarion,Everything lies ahead. I can see my path to a waking dream.
Astarion,Everything is moving at a grinding pace. I feel like I will live thousands of hours every day.
Astarion,"My thoughts exactly. It's been a fun night so far, but I can feel my bedroll calling."
Astarion,"Tempting, but this might not be the time or the place. "
Astarion,Have I? It's possible. I think my instincts have become so quick that the world around me can't catch up. 
Astarion,It's going to take a while to become acquainted with my new self.
Astarion,Never again. I will not think about him. I don't want to even say his name.
Astarion,Well. I hope I'm not interrupting.
Astarion,"I know we had our fun, but I wish you and Shadowheart well. I've grown rather fond of seeing you together."
Astarion,The world will stir in fear.
Astarion,"Well of course I would have! Sweet hells, it's not every day you can do a horizontal dance with a devil."
Astarion,And? What do you have to say for yourself?
Astarion,It's always a pleasure to see you sauntering over.
Astarion,"You really ended things with Karlach, just to be with me?"
Astarion,"You really ended things with Gale, just to be with me?"
Astarion,"Huh. Turns out, he's immortal. Who'd've thunk?"
Astarion,"There you are. I've been waiting, you know."
Astarion,"Lurking here, waiting for you to return so we could face Cazador together."
Astarion,"And to repay my trust - ...you killed him. While I was sitting here, waiting for you."
Astarion,I hear you did the deed. How was your little romp?
Astarion,You filthy devil! I'm shocked.
Astarion,"I thought the two of you would just flop about like dying fish and then call it a night, but no. Shows me."
Astarion,"Oh dear, it was a flop? How disappointing."
Astarion,I hope next time you'll have higher standards when it comes to playmates.
Astarion,But you're not here to gossip. What can I do for you?
Astarion,"Well of course it meant nothing! She's a devil, she's hardly going to fall in love."
Astarion,Everything will be ours. Everything.
Astarion,It was a mistake. You didn't invite me!
Astarion,"Hello, my sweet."
Astarion,"Now, what was it you wanted?"
Astarion,"It's hardly a surprise you'd invest your heart in our Sharran. I'm sure she's a delight, even if she's a little... conflicted. "
Astarion,Not a good time to lie about.
Astarion,"So, will you dedicate yourself entirely to your new, true love? Is this the end of our late-night trysts?"
Astarion,"I was holding back a little, it's true. I didn't want to lose control."
Astarion,"Maybe if Shadowheart had more experience in these affairs, or if you two weren't just starting out, but this? No."
Astarion,Take it from someone with experience - hearts are built to break. They do it over the smallest things. 
Astarion,"And if our favourite Sharran's heart breaks, I'm worried she might get a little... murdery?"
Astarion,But enough about your adorable personal life. What did you actually want to talk about?
Astarion,"Not that I wanted to hear it, but you and Lae'zel are louder than worgs in heat. Although the shouts and screams do sound more tender and loving lately."
Astarion,I am in no way comfortable with that! Lae'zel would never approve and I value my life too much to get on her bad side.
Astarion,"You're - you're here. Thank goodness, I was worried about you."
Astarion,"Hello, beautiful."
Astarion,"Yes, darling? "
Astarion,"I did miss that face, you know."
Astarion,Were you actually worried I was angry? Oh you sweet little thing - I'm not going to abandon a feast just because someone else had a nibble.
Astarion,"Spoilsport. Well, what do you want, if you're not here to gossip?"
Astarion,Is it time? Can we finally go and end Cazador?
Astarion,"Little love, whatever could be the matter?"
Astarion,"Yes, that's why I'm mocking you - to keep our spirits up. No other reason..."
Astarion,"Although your condition means tasting you could be a risky proposition. You're quite the forbidden fruit, aren't you?"
Astarion,This isn't about hunger. It's about pleasure.
Astarion,Excuse me? That's just mean - we're all adults here.
Astarion,"I thought we had an understanding, but I guess I'll just entertain myself tonight."
Astarion,Then what are you doing here?
Astarion,Really? And how - specifically - have you misjudged my fine character?
Astarion,I wasn't going to bite you. I'm here because I thought we'd have a little fun.
Astarion,"But if you don't trust me, then I guess even that's off the table."
Astarion,"Let me guess - you thought I'd suck blood, but actually I just suck? Was that your witty jab?"
Astarion,"I wasn't going to bite you. I told you this was about pleasure, not hunger."
Astarion,It seems I was wrong. Pity. You look delicious in the moonlight.
Astarion,"It's funny - I don't recall asking your opinion, Wyll."
Astarion,Really? I thought we had an understanding. A connection.
Astarion,My thoughts exactly. I want to go before anyone else thanks me for saving their tails.
Astarion,"Nothing escapes the Blade of Frontiers' keen senses, I see."
Astarion,"I know, can you imagine the noise? This is much more peaceful."
Astarion,All denied to us because of what Zariel did to you.
Astarion,"Just to remind you, I'm merely a spawn. It won't count."
Astarion,"There may be an inferno in you, Karlach, but at the end of the day you've been frigid for a decade, isn't that right?"
Astarion,"Gods, you're beautiful."
Astarion,Or maybe you don't.
Astarion,Death was better for them. Death is better for many. I will stand by it.
Astarion,Karlach! You know what I mean.
Astarion,"You've no idea the stories I could tell, sweet Karlach. But you - you're just -"
Astarion,Me too. Keep an eye out for any passing vagrants.
Astarion,You think you know the life I've led? The experiences I've had?
Astarion,"What do we do, if not... that?"
Astarion,You can't be serious? This is a howling wasteland!
Astarion,I haven't even had a bath since the abduction. I must reek of illithid slime.
Astarion,"Is there something you want to talk about, my dear?"
Astarion,"Friends' might be a stretch, but otherwise - yes, I fully agree!"
Astarion,"Well, if the doublet fits..."
Astarion,"I - you know, I have no idea what to do with you."
Astarion,"But if you want a true vampire, I'm happy to recommend one."
Astarion,"Ask me anything, and it will be yours."
Astarion,"Of course not, I'm a pussycat really. Just ask anyone who's seen my claws."
Astarion,"Now, shall we get on? I want to go before anyone else thanks me for saving their tails."
Astarion,We shall see.
Astarion,"But we should move. We've got a big day ahead of us, and I can't spend it all chatting to you."
Astarion,"But first we must manage the trifling matter of the brain. Perhaps it will listen to us. Perhaps it, too, will serve."
Astarion,"I wish we could retreat into our palace already, and spend a decade in each other's arms. "
Astarion,"It's a sweet thought, but fish just doesn't have the flavour of full-blooded red meat."
Astarion,"Oh, I know I could never tempt you, but maybe your little friend would like to perch on a more elegant shoulder?"
Astarion,You'll never know unless you try. Just once? Maybe you'll like it.
Astarion,Yes... I mean - no? I am not interested in biting the rodent is the point.
Astarion,"From the crimson palace, I will govern day and night. Create a city of spawn who bow before me, cast a fog over the world for my children."
Astarion,Not least because he lives in your trousers...
Astarion,Minsc! Enough! The hamster isn't saying a damn thing and you know it.
Astarion,How delightfully vicious. I'm beginning to like the hamster.
Astarion,Why in the hells are you bothering me now?
Astarion,"My consort, we are so close to our triumph, I can almost taste it."
Astarion,"Look at you, precious thing. You always stare so eagerly."
Astarion,You sleep light. I thought you'd be exhausted after last night.
Astarion,My thoughts exactly. I want to go before the goblins start waking up.
Astarion,"Baldur's Gate is a city of opportunity like no other, and I don't intend to let one like this pass us by."
Astarion,"Now, shall we get on? I want to go before the goblins start waking up."
Astarion,It may soon come to an end if you don't shut your mouth.
Astarion,"Given the noise you made last night, I'm sure they already know."
Astarion,"Well, most people are idiots, Wyll. You can lure them into a dragon's maw if you promise a bag of sweets."
Astarion,"Minsc, please - slow down. Use your words."
Astarion,"Safety, sweets - it's the same principle."
Astarion,I'd hate for anyone to think they could bed me and just talk the night away.
Astarion,Finally. I'm just glad your performance last night was better than your pillow talk.
Astarion,Wonderful! I'd hate to be destroyed by any common old magic.
Astarion,"Now let's go, before I regret my restraint last night."
Astarion,Shut up. You don't know what it was like. You never will.
Astarion,Now let's go. We've wasted enough time already.
Astarion,"Anyway, enough pillow talk. Let's go, before the tieflings drag us into another mess."
Astarion,"Precisely. I'm not ashamed, dear. I won. We won."
Astarion,"I'm so lucky I crash-landed next to such an intelligent creature as you. We make a fine team, don't we?"
Astarion,"Anyway, enough pillow talk. Let's go, before the goblins start stirring."
Astarion,"Of course, so do I. Luxury, sin, all the Baldurian comforts I'm finally free to enjoy."
Astarion,"Suddenly? Darling, you haven't been paying attention."
Astarion,"Ah, my favourite travelling companion."
Astarion,"What can I do for you, my friend?"
Astarion,You are so beautiful... And you will be beautiful forever. Thank you for trusting me.
Astarion,"Of course, there are different vintages. Young noble is wonderful if you can get it, but crone has its charms too."
Astarion,Terrifying and brilliant. I knew you'd take it in your stride.
Astarion,"You are stronger now. Better. You will thank me one day, I am sure."
Astarion,It all depends. A clean neck certainly helps.
Astarion,"Whatever the bastard wrote, it won't change what he did to me."
Astarion,No! I'm not.
Astarion,Infernal? I - no. It doesn't matter what it says.
Astarion,Things will be a touch different for you than they were for me when I was a spawn.
Astarion,Not one in particular. The city is a veritable feast of sweethearts.
Astarion,"No sweethearts, no. I prefer them savoury."
Astarion,"So, for what it's worth. In the end I respect you for making the choice you did. I never thought you had it in you."
Astarion,Probably.
Astarion,Shadowheart! You wound me.
Astarion,I can't blame them. You're delicious.
Astarion,"I hope if not partners, we may be partners in crime yet."
Astarion,"It doesn't matter anyway. Whatever the bastard wrote, it won't change anything he did to me."
Astarion,"I think this has all worked out for the best, hasn't it?"
Astarion,Now let's get back to camp and our bedrolls. We should try to get some rest tonight.
Astarion,"You're overestimating how capable goblins are of thought, but fine. We'll do it your way."
Astarion,Charming.
Astarion,"No innocents, you have my word. Only villains that we need to kill anyway."
Astarion,"After all, you know what I am now. I can fight with all my weapons - teeth included."
Astarion,Of course! That sounds eminently reasonable.
Astarion,But I will ensure our little mission to defeat the brain succeeds. You can count on me for that.
Astarion,I shall wait patiently until you suggest we... dine together. 
Astarion,"But until then: no more late-night surprises, you have my word on that."
Astarion,"You have my word. From here on out, I'll only feed on villains and vagabonds."
Astarion,So it shall be. Never again.
Astarion,"At least until the brain is defeated, you have my word I'll stand by you. We share a common cause. There will be no more bites in the night."
Astarion,"I just want to survive, same as you."
Astarion,"Excuse me? Since this tadpole, I'm barely a monster at all."
Astarion,Not a skill that has cropped up in my newly-found repertoire. I probably need to read some tome to figure out how.
Astarion,Finally. I was starting to wonder if immolation would have been easier than talking. 
Astarion,You sound disappointed. I'll bite you if you ask.
Astarion,"In that case, I'll restrict myself to animals and only the dullest goblins."
Astarion,I'm imbibed with unfathomable new talents. I am fairly certain I can extend Mephistopheles' blessings unto you.
Astarion,"You will be stronger, swifter, sharper, but you won't be different. You were already perfect before. It's hard to improve."
Astarion,"But I'd have to climb so many stairs. Anyway, I already have my eye on a palace in Baldur's Gate."
Astarion,She's a vampire.
Astarion,He's a vampire.
Astarion,Infernal? I... Who knows? The bastard was insane.
Astarion,"Anyway, let's back to camp and our bedrolls. We should try to get some rest tonight."
Astarion,Horses? Perish the thought - those ill-tempered beasts are prone to biting.
Astarion,"And I'm not offering any rides, if that's what you're thinking."
Astarion,Of course I understand love. All too well.
Astarion,"I don't know, it's not like I can look in a mirror and see."
Astarion,"My 'whiff' is very faint, thank you - nothing a little bergamot, rosemary, and a hint of aged brandy can't hide."
Astarion,"It's the perfect olfactory disguise for a corpse. Honestly, I missed my calling as a perfumer."
Astarion,You've seen enough already.
Astarion,"I sound like a charming rake, you mean? The hero everyone fawns over?"
Astarion,The gravest crimes committed in this world are committed for love. A hunger crueller than bloodlust.
Astarion,"And if I can't see it, you certainly can't."
Astarion,They're a vampire.
Astarion,You need not fear anything.
Astarion,"Well I can't just check in a mirror, can I?"
Astarion,"The man of your dreams, the hope of him, is your own worst enemy."
Astarion,"You probably expect me to turn into a sea of mist, run wrongside-up on roofs, and to call on legions of wolves in battle."
Astarion,"I don't intend to die, if you don't. I truly believe we can best the brain, united like this."
Astarion,"Exactly what symptoms of vampirism are going to manifest in you... well, we'll have to see what hand the tadpole has in suppressing them, when we wrangle it under our command."
Astarion,"Oh, I don't know, but a little more colour wouldn't hurt. All the black and purple just makes me think of bruises..."
Astarion,"*Sigh.* There's no use in us fighting any longer, is there?"
Astarion,Awed? By this? Please - size isn't everything. At least when it comes to temples.
Astarion,"You are a person of rare talent. You aided greatly in my conquest, even if you did not end up a part of it."
Astarion,"And if we were beholden to one another? Well, how is that too different to being enslaved? It is for the best."
Astarion,"Let's just say blood tastes better from a gold goblet, and silk bedsheets improve any night-time activity."
Astarion,"It's a poem. A gift from my old master, Cazador. He considered himself quite the artist and used his slaves as a canvas."
Astarion,I'm used to a crypt's gloom. This is something else.
Astarion,I've spent long enough in the dark. It gets old.
Astarion,He composed and carved that one over the course of a night. He made a lot of revisions as he went.
Astarion,I don't care for fish. Red meat - now that's a different matter. Rare as can be... dripping.
Astarion,Yes. What of it?
Astarion,"Tempting, but it's not really for me."
Astarion,"Hello, my dear."
Astarion,But fine. I'll do my best to feed on only the dumbest animals.
Astarion,"It feels ridiculous to still be thinking about Cazador. He's gone, I'm here - I won."
Astarion,Waiting since the moment I set eyes on you.
Astarion,Waiting to have you.
Astarion,Don't I? You're here. And I don't think you want to talk.
Astarion,I think you want to be known. To be tasted.
Astarion,What do any of us want? Pleasure.
Astarion,Yours. Mine. Our collective ecstasy.
Astarion,"That's what you want, isn't it? To lose yourself in me?"
Astarion,I thought so.
Astarion,Then let's have some fun.
Astarion,"Believe it or not, I did. You're certainly... different."
Astarion,But we should probably get back before we're missed. People might talk.
Astarion,"Given the noise you made earlier, I'm sure they already know."
Astarion,You sleep light. I thought you'd be exhausted.
Astarion,How dare you - I'm a consummate lover.
Astarion,"I was holding back, if anything. Worried that I might... lose control."
Astarion,There you are. I've been waiting.
Astarion,"Delicious as you were, I didn't want to go too far."
Astarion,"Fine, as long as I don't have to go back to animal blood. It's muck."
Astarion,I already apologised. What more do you want?
Astarion,We're both learning a lot. Cazador kept this place all to himself.
Astarion,Well. I hope your romp was worth it.
Astarion,What a party. We should do this again.
Astarion,And yet here we stand. We're either very clever or very lucky.
Astarion,I like it.
Astarion,"Come to kill me again, darling?"
Astarion,"You'd be surprised, drow. I've survived a lot of things."
Astarion,"You think I'm beautiful? Oh, Minthara."
Astarion,"In you, too, I can tell... your heartbeat races... you hold your breath while I speak. You await my command."
Astarion,"Finally, we're catching up on our puppet master. And the hunt ends at Moonrise Towers."
Astarion,"I rather think they did. Can't imagine anyone wanting to do that for you, though dear."
Astarion,"Scurrying footpads in their safe-houses, rats below our feet in their filthy holes, the crows in the night above... They will obey."
Astarion,I think not. That is for me and my darling to share.
Astarion,"I think I know a thing or two about persistent curses, thank you."
Astarion,Care to share any of Minthara's weaknesses? Or would it take too long to go through them all?
Astarion,Unless you're looking for another nibble...
Astarion,Not that I'd be surprised to see a druid talking to a tree...
Astarion,"Now, shall we head back? We should try to get some rest before the sun comes up."
Astarion,"I told you that I was a magistrate in Baldur's Gate, but that's only part of it."
Astarion,"I mean, elves and humans are obviously out, but goblins? Kobolds? Gnomes?"
Astarion,"I mean, elves and humans are obviously out, but goblins? Kobolds? Halflings?"
Astarion,You can literally talk to animals. What does that leave me - rocks and trees?
Astarion,A tragedy - just think of all that wasted blood.
Astarion,"Oh, I don't know. I've fed on things that would disgust most vultures."
Astarion,"Not a great improvement, but at least they didn't mutilate me."
Astarion,Vampires would be a safe bet.
Astarion,"So long as there's a cheering crowd. As for vampire dens, I'd brace your nose. They can be very... organic."
Astarion,It's a poem. A gift from Cazador. He considered himself quite the artist and used his slaves as a canvas.
Astarion,I don't know. I never asked for a reading and it's not like I can just peek in a mirror to see.
Astarion,"It's not required, but it is nice to have. It buys any number of ways to keep life interesting."
Astarion,I am the greatest vampire to ever walk this land. Even the Pale Knight would have knelt before me.
Astarion,This is it. The hopeless dream dreamt by all of my kind. 
Astarion,Finally. I'm just glad your performance earlier was better than your pillow talk.
Astarion,But I still keep reliving everything that happened. Playing it over and over in my mind.
Astarion,Although... what do you consider an animal?
Astarion,My past isn't exactly a happy story.
Astarion,What? You're joking?
Astarion,Everything has changed...
Astarion,"The mind flayers weren't my first kidnapping. A long time ago, I crossed Cazador - a powerful man in Baldur's Gate."
Astarion,He captured me. Kept me for years as his slave.
Astarion,I'd hate for anyone to think they can bed me and just talk the night away.
Astarion,Yes. It's a poem. My old master considered himself quite the artist.
Astarion,It was.
Astarion,Cazador said the scars were his gift. A poem to carry with me.
Astarion,"That was my second kidnapping, when the mind flayers snatched me up."
Astarion,"But now that you know what I am, I can fight with all my weapons, teeth included. And if I happen to drain the occasional bandit, what's the harm?"
Astarion,"Maybe. But there won't be any more midnight surprises, I can promise you that. "
Astarion,"What? Look, I swear I won't come after yours, but anyone's? "
Astarion,You know what I am now. I can fight with all my weapons - teeth included.
Astarion,"And if I happen to drain the occasional bandit during a fight, what's the harm? They're just as dead."
Astarion,"Excellent! Now, shall we go? I already feel a little peckish."
Astarion,As am I. I'm starting to feel a little peckish already.
Astarion,I felt so very little for so long... My edges dulled over the numb years rotting in the boudoir and kennels.
Astarion,And don't feel the need to brag to the others about our little tryst. 
Astarion,"Listen, it's just -... I'm sorry, all right? Is that what you want?"
Astarion,"'Just be' what, exactly? Frustrated? Bored?"
Astarion,Oh no - don't you tar me with your 'normal' brush. My demons keep me extraordinary.
Astarion,He always insisted we were a family - even when he was carving scars into our flesh.
Astarion,"I was one of his first, some of the others came years later. He was a monster to us all, but did take special pleasure in my pain. He said my screams sounded sweetest."
Astarion,And now that I'm gone... I don't know. I pity the other six...
Astarion,"Darling, I would love to take a break from this, but do you see where we are? I can't just stroll to our camp from here now, can I?"
Astarion,"It's too soon - we need more time together. You need to live your life, damn it."
Astarion,"Oh darling, I'm hurt. I thought we had something special."
Astarion,I guess I'll spend my evenings lounging here while you do all the hard work.
Astarion,It sounds awful.
Astarion,"Well, you know where to find me."
Astarion,"Sorry, but I prefer groups that are a little smaller. More intimate. "
Astarion,Lose a follower or two and I might consider it.
Astarion,"Darling, I thought you'd never ask."
Astarion,Lead on.
Astarion,I'm sure you and Wyll will grow old together and have many snotty children you can ship off to board in Waterdeep.
Astarion,"Sorry, was there something you actually wanted?"
Astarion,Cazador sired seven spawn - me and my six 'brothers and sisters'.
Astarion,Wyll's the sort of prince-type I would have once dreamed of marrying. When I was about thirteen.
Astarion,"Well, of course I've thought about it. If I completed the ritual instead of Cazador, I'd get all that power. And I could walk in the sun without fear I'd turn into a mind flayer. "
Astarion,"I don't relish it, but my siblings lured thousands of people to their deaths over the years. I doubt Baldur's Gate would miss them."
Astarion,"But regardless, the plan is simple - find him, stop him from gaining almighty power, and then really enjoy killing him."
Astarion,"And if I can seize that almighty power for myself? Well, all the better."
Astarion,Yes? No? I'm not sure.
Astarion,"It is full of terrible secrets, including Cazador's bloody 'Rite of Profane Ascension', but it told me nothing new."
Astarion,"Then again, it was filled with otherworldly power. Which I am more than happy to wield to my advantage."
Astarion,"I was hoping for something that would let me escape whatever fate Cazador had planned for me. Instead, I found the Rite of Profane Ascension."
Astarion,"It grants my kind the freedom to walk in the sun, be free of our hunger, and accrue all manner of powers."
Astarion,All it requires is the sacrifice of a few souls. Souls by scars that look exactly like mine.
Astarion,This rite - it's been Cazador's plan the whole time. He's going to sacrifice me and who knows how many others so he can 'ascend' to all this power.
Astarion,"I'm sorry, I... I might need a moment. This is a lot to take in..."
Astarion,"The thing that will decide my fate forevermore? Yes, it has been on my mind - why?"
Astarion,"Well, in theory it's simple: destroy Cazador, stop ritual. That's assuming we want to stop the ritual..."
Astarion,"What? I've obviously thought about it! If I was the one who completed the ritual, I'd have such power. And I could walk in the sun without fear I'd turn into a mind flayer."
Astarion,"A pity then, that it's not your decision to make."
Astarion,"Of course, I don't even know if I could complete the ritual. It may be impossible - but it certainly is tempting."
Astarion,"I hadn't really decided on the specifics. Obviously we could stop the ritual, or... not?"
Astarion,"Come now, Wyll won't agree to that. He's stuck in the past, and that's coming from a vampire."
Astarion,"But if you ever get tired of your decades-long devotion to one another, I'm always here for a sordid affair."
Astarion,"Never say never, darling."
Astarion,"Sorry, you're not here to talk about your tragic love life. What is it you want?"
Astarion,Karlach treats every embrace as if it might be her last. Or your last. What a way to go...
Astarion,You and Karlach? Well that's certainly a... unique pairing.
Astarion,Imagine forgetting how it feels to hold someone. All because of what some devil did to her.
Astarion,But she has you now. I'm sure that's some comfort. 
Astarion,I'll try not to take it personally that you chose someone you can't even touch over me.
Astarion,I'm sure she's something else now that you can touch her. All those years of pent-up frustration - it has to go somewhere.
Astarion,"Not being able to touch you, having to slow down, it's all... I'm just not used to it. "
Astarion,"Darling, healthy relationships are not my strong point, but even I can see she loves you."
Astarion,"Normally I'd be all for finding an arrangement, but hearts are fragile things at the best of times. And Karlach's?"
Astarion,"After what she's been through, it will need a very gentle hand. So let's not complicate things, hmm?"
Astarion,"Trust me, you will have more than enough on your plate without me there too. This is for the best."
Astarion,What? Why?
Astarion,"I mean, obviously I can understand why - we've had a lot of fun together."
Astarion,But I thought you had something... more with Gale? 
Astarion,"Karlach treats every embrace as if it might be her last. And hells, it might be."
Astarion,"We can try, but it may be difficult."
Astarion,"After all, I know you'll spend the rest of your days dreaming about the nights we spent together. You lucky thing, you."
Astarion,"If it helps, I'm more than happy with where things are."
Astarion,"But for now, I'm more than happy for you and your newly-acquired Blade. If only he was as sharp as me."
Astarion,"You little scoundrel, you."
Astarion,"Only when it comes to morals. I'm very, very good where it counts."
Astarion,"Hello, lover."
Astarion,"Yes, darling? Do you need something?"
Astarion,Need something? Or did you just miss me?
Astarion,I hear you found a new lover.
Astarion,"Neither will I, darling. At least I hope you'll come along for the show?"
Astarion,"I'm sure you can look forward to long, passionate nights of conversation in the library."
Astarion,"Now, did you want something?"
Astarion,Gale of Waterdeep: a limp passion.
Astarion,"So, will you want to keep yourself for your new, true love? Is this the end of our late-night conversations?"
Astarion,"So, will you want to keep yourself for your new, true love? Is this the end of our late-night trysts?"
Astarion,Even though they were an awful lot of fun?
Astarion,"Oh don't be sorry, we both knew what we were to each other. A fun distraction, nothing more."
Astarion,"Oh my dear, you're sweet, but we must have standards."
Astarion,"At least you have the memory of our night together to reflect on. You're welcome, by the way."
Astarion,A fine opportunity.
Astarion,"So yes, I do worry about facing him. But if we can get his attention, finding the ritual's location will be much easier, and that could give me the edge I need."
Astarion,"But he's arrogant too. If he does hear I'm back, he'll try to take me and expose himself in the process. Then I'll be able to strike."
Astarion,Someone there?
Astarion,What did you do with the poor wretches?
Astarion,"That was a kindness. I think? It's hard to know, really."
Astarion,I'm not sure if I feel worse for them or the creatures of the Underdark. But at least they're free.
Astarion,"I suppose they're at peace, if nothing else. Or whatever passes for peace these days."
Astarion,"Gods. Well, maybe it's for the best. I don't know if killing them feels right, but freeing them? I'm not sure the world is ready to have seven thousand hungry spawn unleashed on it. "
Astarion,"Still, this will take some getting used to - Cazador being... gone."
Astarion,I just need some time to let it sink in - to figure out what it means now that he's gone.
Astarion,Thank you. And thank you for what you did. 
Astarion,"I thought Cazador's story would end with more of a bang than a whimper, but... well, you did end it. I'm grateful."
Astarion,You may be waiting a while. This has brought up some complicated feelings.
Astarion,You choose now to have a chat? This exact moment?
Astarion,"Your timing is incredible, but all right. What do you want?"
Astarion,Gods help them. But perhaps they'll find some kind of peace at the end of all this. 
Astarion,"I don't know. I don't know what I would have done - what I could have done, even."
Astarion,What now?
Astarion,Just - I just need some space. I'm sure this will all start to sink in soon. 
Astarion,Trust no one.
Astarion,I should just leave you.
Astarion,You're not dying today.
Astarion,I'm not killing them all myself.
Astarion,There's still killing to do.
Astarion,You're not a corpse yet.
Astarion,My patience is running thin.
Astarion,Of course you're stuck.
Astarion,Of course you're stuck. 
Astarion,Help the idiot.
Astarion,Worse than useless.
Astarion,Why not? Life wouldn't taste half as sweet without you by my side.
Astarion,"Not to mention, I am the Vampire Ascendant. Where else could I find a worthy challenge?"
Astarion,"Oh, I've heard. But isn't that part of the fun? Bringing chaos to a whole new realm?"
Astarion,I'd - I'd even come with you. We can cut our way through the Hells together.
Astarion,"After all, Raphael's gone to wage war against Zariel. She'll be too busy fighting him to come after you."
Astarion,Some don't deserve saving.
Astarion,Keep a blade close.
Astarion,"I don't know what I feel right now. I'm trying to absorb everything and - hells, it's so much... "
Astarion,You're so good to me.
Astarion,Safe? How can I ever be safe now? 
Astarion,"It's not a plan yet - more a feeling. Just an itch at the back of my mind, but I know I'm missing something."
Astarion,"Whatever Cazador did to me, it was more than his usual sadism: it had purpose."
Astarion,"Once I know what that purpose was, maybe a plan will present itself. But for now I just need to scratch this itch. "
Astarion,"You did? Gods damn it, I wanted to be there! I wanted to make a deal..."
Astarion,"All right, so what did the old devil have to say?"
Astarion,"Well, I do like killing..."
Astarion,He doesn't have to be trustworthy to be useful. None of us do.
Astarion,"Perhaps if we help him, I can still salvage something from this. He would owe us, after all..."
Astarion,"Yes... Yes, this might work! Now we just need to get on his good side."
Astarion,"If we do as he asks, he'll be in our debt. And if he's in our debt, he can tell me everything there is to know about my scars..."
Astarion,"Please understand, this is important. I need to ask Raphael about some scars Cazador left on my back."
Astarion,"He carved them into my back over one long night, saying it was a poem. But it's more than that, I'm sure."
Astarion,"Whatever he wrote, he wrote it in Infernal. And if anyone can reveal infernal secrets - Raphael can. That's why we have to do as he asks."
Astarion,"Not to you, maybe, but it's important to me."
Astarion,"I won't lie, the thought hardly fills me with glee. Even with my new-found advantages, he's still an incredibly powerful vampire."
Astarion,You stole my chance at vengeance - my chance to become more than some wretched spawn.
Astarion,Because you robbed me of the chance to do it.
Astarion,Because he was my master or because you thought I couldn't resist finishing the ritual myself?
Astarion,I had a chance to live forever in the sun. To be free of the hunger that wracks me day and night.
Astarion,"That ritual was my one shot at security, at independence - and you snatched it from my hands."
Astarion,I - ...I do understand - there's always a risk we'll become the monsters we want to slay.
Astarion,"I'll never say you saved me from him, but perhaps you saved me from myself..."
Astarion,Perhaps. But perhaps not.
Astarion,"All right. If you say so, then I believe you."
Astarion,Although maybe the ritual could have something to do with it. I did immediately accuse you of plotting to keep me from it...
Astarion,Even now you're lying. Pathetic.
Astarion,"It's something of a gamble, true, but if I can win - if I can beat him, it would be worth any risk."
Astarion,I could have had that much power! I could have walked in the sun!
Astarion,Easy to say when you're not the one facing a lifetime of hunger in the shadows.
Astarion,"Whatever your fears, this is my life. It should have been my choice, and you should have trusted me to make it."
Astarion,"We've come so far together, we may as well see this tadpole business through to the end. But once that's done, we're done."
Astarion,Now leave me be. I have a lot to think about.
Astarion,"We have been through a lot, but this? This is too much."
Astarion,"If I were in a position to, I'd leave you here and now. Lucky for you, I'll have to stick around a little longer."
Astarion,You can deal with the tadpole yourself. I'm done with you.
Astarion,And now you have the gall to stand here and announce that you've doomed me to this life forever.
Astarion,"As you live with his gift, for better or worse, now so do I."
Astarion,But I'm sure you'll find your way. And we'll always have the memories of what we did together.
Astarion,"Excuse me? What plans? Lurking in the sewers, feasting on rat brains?"
Astarion,"But just because you're a monster, it doesn't mean we don't have a glorious future ahead of us."
Astarion,"So come on, darling. Let's show this world what monsters can do."
Astarion,"Exactly my thought! Together, we can rule this city, and the cattle won't even realise it's happening."
Astarion,I'm offering you a chance to be useful - to be more than the monster you've become. I thought you'd be grateful.
Astarion,"But if you won't accept my kindness, that's on your slimy head."
Astarion,"It is a shame, though. You were something special."
Astarion,"I'll never forget the person you used to be - the beauty I bedded, the warrior I fought beside, the hero that saved this city."
Astarion,"I feel safer already, having a bard around the camp."
Astarion,"The people may not appreciate you now that you're a grotesque freak, but I do."
Astarion,"After all, you helped me attain perfection. I owe all of this to you, so... thank you."
Astarion,Now get the hells out of my city.
Astarion,"Not at all! I just wonder, which is better at felling a goblin - a ballad or a jig?"
Astarion,Absolutely not. We've hit our quota for mangy strays.
Astarion,Your expertise is noted.
Astarion,"And it's such a pity, because you were beautiful. You would have looked magnificent ruling by my side."
Astarion,"But fine - if you want to make your own future, have at it. And if you crash and burn, that's on your slimy head."
Astarion,"I'm not sure. A dance with death, maybe."
Astarion,Everything looks new.
Astarion,Excuse me? These are the only games worth playing.
Astarion,What a day.
Astarion,But fine. You don't need my friendship and I don't need you sliming around my palace.
Astarion,"A unique read, certainly. A tome of necromancy, guarded by spirits."
Astarion,Let's see what the day brings.
Astarion,Was the sun always that bright?
Astarion,Hello again.
Astarion,"Really? And what does your path include? Lurking in the sewers, feasting on rat brains?"
Astarion,A pity you won't be here to see it.
Astarion,"My love, stuck with this ticking time bomb in your chest. It's nothing short of a tragedy. "
Astarion,How are you feeling?
Astarion,No need to thank me.
Astarion,Things feel... different.
Astarion,"It would never work, sweetie. Not when I look like this and you... well, you're monstrous. "
Astarion,"Oh, don't be like that. You can't have thought we'd stay together."
Astarion,"I can build up my power here in the light, while you lurk below in the shadows."
Astarion,Agh! It's hot - gods - it's burning!
Astarion,"A vampire spawn, technically, but - listen, last night was a mistake. It won't happen again, I swear."
Astarion,"Sorry, darling, I haven't got time for underlings."
Astarion,"Mephistopheles has made a new monster, not bound a creature to his will. The Rite was honoured, the sacrifice is over. "
Astarion,"If your boss wants to speak to me, I'm all pointy ears."
Astarion,"Figure out whose side you're on, or I'll decide for you."
Astarion,"Yes, love?"
Astarion,"A vampire spawn, technically, but - look, it was a mistake. It won't happen again."
Astarion,"You are on some very thin ice, darling."
Astarion,"A vampire spawn, technically, but - well, I hope this doesn't change things between us."
Astarion,"We can start seeing eye-to-eye, or I can find new companions."
Astarion,"A vampire spawn, so - look, I made a mistake. But you can trust me, I swear."
Astarion,"If we're not seeing eye-to-snout soon, I'll be forced to find new companions."
Astarion,I do hope you'll be comfortable in our little camp.
Astarion,"Would you like a tour? We can start with my tent, if you like."
Astarion,"We draw the wrong kind of attention, and then I have to get up and kill these idiots."
Astarion,This is what we get for turning our camp into a stopping place for every lost soul in Faerûn.
Astarion,"No, a simple alliance is far more useful to us both. "
Astarion,"Haha! Oh darling, please. I can't have something like this as my lover. The mechanics alone..."
Astarion,Yes. We will be powerful allies.
Astarion,A shame. I was looking forward to having you as my consort. But we can still be powerful allies.
Astarion,Very well. There's no accounting for taste.
Astarion,"And you've changed too, of course. A... different aesthetic, but with such power."
Astarion,"Trust me, the feeling is exceptionally mutual. "
Astarion,"I can feel my strength growing. Every day that passes, I gain new abilities. "
Astarion,Of course I'm not. It's just - it gets to you.
Astarion,"No, I won't kill them! Well, maybe the tiefling..."
Astarion,No - stop it - I won't kill them!
Astarion,Just tell me what I need to know. Tell me your secrets.
Astarion,Precious little Bhaal-babe!
Astarion,"My dagger-happy friend, what troubles you?"
Astarion,"This is a powerful book of necromancy, but it's guarded by spirits."
Astarion,"I would say 'you're probably used to it', but how could anyone get used to this?"
Astarion,Let's keep you safe.
Astarion,Careful. I bite.
Astarion,That's it? We're done with the conversation?
Astarion,"No, I mean - spending time with you was always fun, even with the complications from your engine, but - I didn't expect more from this."
Astarion,"Still, I've had you once. I'm sure that's more than enough."
Astarion,No. I thought not.
Astarion,"All right, Karlach. Let's try it your way."
Astarion,Let's see what other surprises we have in store for each other.
Astarion,"You know, this has been a surprisingly delightful conversation."
Astarion,"Well, darling, in that case consider yourself well and truly taken."
Astarion,"You will need to end things with Shadowheart, but hopefully she's gotten used to loss by now. "
Astarion,But maybe that's not a bad thing.
Astarion,"My dear, you're much more boring than I gave you credit for."
Astarion,"You'll need to end things with Wyll, of course, but I'm sure he can find somewhere else to bury his blade."
Astarion,"You will need to end things with Lae'zel, though. Preferably while I'm not in range of any thrown weapons."
Astarion,"You will need to break up with Karlach, of course. I hope her heart won't literally break. Because it might..."
Astarion,I guess we're done with more than just the conversation.
Astarion,"Make sure it's actually him, by the way. You can never tell with those projections of his. "
Astarion,"Ah, you're so adorable when you're thinking what to say."
Astarion,We - we could try? If that's truly what you want.
Astarion,"Are you working against me, or are you just simple?"
Astarion, Hello again.
Astarion,I would be glad to join you.
Astarion,"You travel with too many, come back when you have less companions."
Astarion,"You don't seem like a leader, come back when the one in charge is with you."
Astarion,"Karlach, champion of the Hells, wants to talk and then fall asleep? "
Astarion,"So, can you -... I don't know. Help? Show me what to do?"
Astarion,*Tadpole connection moment*
Astarion,"Here, darling."
Astarion,"I - ...I'm sorry, Karlach. It's just, not being able to touch you - having to slow down, it's... I'm just not used to it."
Astarion,Let's be safe.
Astarion,Just in case.
Astarion,"You'll need to end things with Gale, of course."
Astarion,Don't touch me.
Astarion,But I thought you had something... more with Karlach?
Astarion,But I thought you had something... more with Wyll?
Astarion,I've never seen anything like this place. I've never dreamt of anything like this place.
Astarion,"I'm rarely speechless, but it is hard to find the words for... any of this."
Astarion,How delicious.
Astarion,"Keep your distance, darling."
Astarion,"This is - well... you know, I have no idea what to do with you. "
Astarion,You again.
Astarion,But what's a sinner to do when faced with the very embodiment of chastity?
Astarion,What do you need now?
Astarion,"I hope there's nothing troubling you, my dear?"
Astarion,"Trust me, it's a challenge for both of us."
Astarion,"If we don't start seeing eye-to-navel, I'll find new travelling companions."
Astarion,You're staring at me again. What do you want?
Astarion,But I thought you had something... more with Lae'zel?
Astarion,I know it's you! It's obviously you.
Astarion,And nothing. I just wanted to know where we stood.
Astarion,I -
Astarion,But I thought you had something... more with Shadowheart?
Astarion,"You really ended things with Shadowheart, just to be with me?"
Astarion,"You really ended things with Wyll, just to be with me?"
Astarion,"My sweet, conflicted villain. What can I do for you?"
Astarion,Is it true? You've decided to replace me?
Astarion,No! Don't give me that - I can see what this is.
Astarion,I'm not even surprised. You were a mistake from the beginning.
Astarion,"Technically, I'm a vampire spawn. But don't worry, I'll stick to biting those who're trying to kill us. Mostly."
Astarion,I just - I didn't think...
Astarion,"Why don't we put ourselves out of this misery and just sleep? If I can at least look at you, I won't have wasted my whole evening."
Astarion,"Well that's it, isn't it? I didn't think - because if I had for even half a second I would have realised how stupid this was."
Astarion,You were a mistake. But not one I'll be making again.
Astarion,Of course you did. Why would you do anything else?
Astarion,Well. To quote you: 'Fuck.'
Gale,"'Down in the pits', no less. Sounds ominous among creatures that love bloodsports. Better step to it."
Gale,"I think you should, yes. No harm in trying the diplomatic route."
Gale,"We've our problems, granted, but there might be some merit in shutting down a local conflict, no?"
Gale,"Let's try to be diplomatic, shall we? Goblins don't come by the handfuls, but by the dozens."
Gale,It's a perfectly legitimate architectural feature!
Gale,It seems you've been paying attention to me - though there is always room for improvement.
Gale,I have a bad feeling that dead elf is Halsin.
Gale,"That fellow had a tadpole in his head, and they consider him blessed? Chosen? What madness is this?"
Gale,The witching hour.
Gale,A tale for the ages.
Gale,Unleash me.
Gale,I speak. They burn.
Gale,Gone with the Weave.
Gale,Let me recite their demise.
Gale,Hello! I'm here on behalf of Gale of Waterdeep to participate in this evening's activities. He would like me to assure you all that I am anatomically accurate.
Gale,Outflank. Outsmart.
Gale,A rough tempest I will raise.
Gale,May it please Mystra.
Gale,An apt metaphor - though I hope it won't lose me some kisses.
Gale,Onward.
Gale,In striking distance.
Gale,Swiftly now.
Gale,"Ah, the fruit of scholars. How I long to have a troop of loyal students grace me with apples by the orchard-full in exchange for wisdoms imparted..."
Gale,Step by step.
Gale,I don't fancy their chances.
Gale,Allow me to demonstrate.
Gale,Mystra-Ryl!
Gale,Step to it.
Gale,I'll enjoy myself well enough from back here! You go on and do... the rutting or what have you.
Gale,No thank you. Sounds as appealing as milking cottage cheese directly from a geriatric cow.
Gale,My word.
Gale,Good move.
Gale,Perhaps you're overestimating my affection towards you a tad? You'd better seek a partner-in-embarrassment elsewhere.
Gale,What are you doing? That's no way to treat a book!
Gale,"Well, if you insist..."
Gale,I am involved! I'm taking notes. Making observations.
Gale,He won't be able to help us no - unless he happens to have a cure on his corpse.
Gale,Death is but a word away.
Gale,What fools these mortals be.
Gale,I've had a little stone caught in my boot the last while - clearly that makes for a better travelling companion than you do.<br>
Gale,Victory is assured.
Gale,The lanceboard is set.
Gale,Let's light them up.
Gale,May the dice roll in my favour.
Gale,I have a bad feeling that dead elf is Halsin. He can't help us now.
Gale,Hold on! It's not too late to settle this without bloodshed.
Gale,It is. It's Tara! What's she doing all the way out here?
Gale,"No gloom, all doom."
Gale,Without delay.
Gale,With haste.
Gale,"Are you sure...? I could conjure up any sight that you could dream of, and a few you could not. I could use the Weave to make us feel sensations beyond reckoning. I could do more than woo you. I could wow you."
Gale,Allow me to live dangerously while I still can.
Gale,"As you like. Thank you, for spending this time with me. If only there was more."
Gale,A small gesture towards your comfort.
Gale,"The old ways then. If that is what you wish, so be it."
Gale,...but we shall try.
Gale,"When you wake, it will be back at our camp, back in our small, dirty, bloody patch of existence. But stay with me now. There are endless worlds out there. Countless ways to declare love. Infinite ways to express it. Too much for one night..."
Gale,Why confine ourselves to the pleasures of mortal flesh? It is but one stitch in a vast tapestry. Let me show you more.
Gale,The stars will be our bed. Come here.
Gale,"Then let's set the book aside an be blank slates on blank sheets, delightfully new."
Gale,This one here is called 'The Art of the Night'. It details the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen.
Gale,On the contrary. No one is lonely when they have books - except perhaps the illiterate.
Gale,"It's called 'The Art of the Night', and it details the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen."
Gale,"My favourite spot. Many times, evening turned to night and back to daybreak once more while I sat here, lost in words."
Gale,"The grand piano plays the Lliirian Suites all by itself, and as we look out beyond the arches that lead to the terrace, we see the weary sun take its daily dive into the sea."
Gale,"The sculptures, the paintings, the walls enlivened by the spines of a thousand books."
Gale,The scene is this: you and I stand in the room that is the centre of my universe.
Gale,How about the perfect night in Waterdeep? Yes... Let's imagine how it would be.
Gale,I want it to be perfect - to bond with you in the way that gods do... intertwining our spirits in visions of the Weave.
Gale,Not if I have any say in the matter.
Gale,Nice to return to familiar environs.
Gale,Let's get you on your feet.
Gale,And that's my mother's sitting room?
Gale,"Yes, you are. Trust me, I would know. Let's do it your way then. So long as it's with you."
Gale,I'd give a lot to be able to kiss you right now. But your presence itself is more than enough. A night stargazing with you is the greatest gift I could ask for.
Gale,Such power leads to only one outcome. Corruption...
Gale,A familiar feeling rises within you. Temptation...
Gale,Doddering old fool. Trust him to leave the hard work to you.
Gale,He would never inflict such cruel terms on you. Mystra must have forced his hand.
Gale,You failed her once. You will not fail her again.
Gale,"The Absolute must be stopped. If this is the only way, so be it."
Gale,To wield enough power to threaten a god. That would be quite something...
Gale,You think on the Netherese magic affecting your tadpole. A magic Mystra abhors...
Gale,"You wonder, did he even try to intervene on your behalf?"
Gale,His disappointment cuts deeper even than Mystra's. He was your hero...
Gale,"Fewer than if the Absolute goes unchecked. I don't want to kill, and I don't want to die... but inaction will lead to bloodshed all the same."
Gale,"I can feel it - ever since we set foot in this strange, corrupted land. The closer we get, the heavier my own heart becomes."
Gale,"But it will not matter, soon enough. Let us just enjoy the view, in silence. We will leave the world a better place than it is tonight."
Gale,"Heartening words - if only they came from the lips of another. This is no time for delusion - we are not close, you and I."
Gale,"Those bonds will soon break. But you were a worthy ally, and could have become much more, in other circumstances. Let us just enjoy the view together. We will leave the world a better place than it is tonight."
Gale,"Your words are those of a dear friend, or a lover even. But this is no time for delusions - fate threw us together, and mutual survival kept us together."
Gale,A good night indeed. The fairest I can imagine...
Gale,"Stay with me, will you? I don't want to think of it any more, but I don't want to be alone either."
Gale,"If there is a way - any way - to save all that's grown dear to me, I want to seize it. I just can't fathom what that might be, other than to fail Mystra and condemn the world."
Gale,"Damn you. Damn you for giving me so much to care about. Our friends, our adventures... this would have been so much easier if it was just me. But it isn't."
Gale,"Yes... but there is so much to live for, and so few moments in which to house it all."
Gale,"Thank you, for spending this time with me. I think I want to be alone now."
Gale,"I see... well perhaps this is for the best. Should my time be short, you will not be wounded too deeply by my absence."
Gale,That's a relief. It would be a shame to spend my final hours making an ass of myself.
Gale,To the rescue.
Gale,A fair assessment - I wish we had more time to practice together.
Gale,Achoo! Pardon me.
Gale,"There's an almost reverent silence that accompanies the peak of darkness, when you'd almost believe the dawn will never break."
Gale,I love this time of night.
Gale,I'm placing my bets on a resounding 'no'. An innocent tiefling died by our hands.
Gale,"Long before my time, thank goodness. That's not an image I care to dwell on."
Gale,Hopefully not during the party.
Gale,"Something of the sheen of Elysium missing, isn't there?"
Gale,"Tara, you must practice acceptance. My new powers are to be utilised, not feared."
Gale,"Oh, Tara. It hurts to be so misunderstood by my oldest friend."
Gale,"Still, I mustn't frighten them with my newfound powers..."
Gale,"Haven't you any ambitions, Tara? I could help you, you know."
Gale,A prayer or two would suffice. Is that so bad?
Gale,"Tara, did you just hiss at me?!"
Gale,To be a god among men...
Gale,"Ah, the material plane. I'd almost forgotten what it's like."
Gale,So very stubborn.
Gale,You sound a man with the nine hells at his heels.
Gale,You'd think a magical apparition with an urgent message would be deserving of some attention...
Gale,I hope my spell doesn't wear off before the toasts begin.
Gale,"A word, please? It's very, very important."
Gale,"Aha! There you are, my mortal friend."
Gale,Aha! There you are!
Gale,"So, you didn't fancy sharpening up the old moniker? I'd have thought the 'Blade of Frontiers' might be feeling a bit dull after all you've been through."
Gale,Orbs of dragonkind. Could it be? I thought only three were left.
Gale,The cradle of eternity.
Gale,The timelessness of lovers.
Gale,That most beautiful of fantasies.
Gale,"Indeed. The curse is still present of course - just veiled and at arm's length for now. Not a trick I can repeat often, but tonight? Tonight is different."
Gale,"And you're a bad liar. I lived the life of a hermit for some time before I met you - safer for all, but not conducive to pleasures of the flesh."
Gale,Tara! I never knew you to be cruel.
Gale,"Nice little spot, isn't it?"
Gale,I'm in love with you.
Gale,"If things were different, if we were home, I'd have taken the time to do things properly. To say it all better. But time is short."
Gale,"I didn't realise you were such a homebody, Tara."
Gale,"I know this is all unreal, but I created it for you. You must know that you're... That you're very special to me."
Gale,Suddenly I had a spot of déjà vu.
Gale,"One moment with you could sate me for a lifetime, and prise the fear from my heart. I'm so very glad you came, to share this with me."
Gale,"Stay with me a while, will you? Day will come all too soon, even in this place."
Gale,My knees are a little stiff. Must be a storm coming.
Gale,"Nothing, unless you can find a way to defeat the elder brain..."
Gale,"I can only hope that there are few innocents within the Absolute's reach, when the time comes... and that you will seek safety, far away from me."
Gale,My knees are aching terribly.
Gale,"There is no point in running from the inevitable. Better to meet it, on my own terms."
Gale,I am terrified - I will not claim otherwise. My face could scarcely conceal it even if my words sought to deny it.
Gale,"I am trying. Believe me, I am. The path is set, and I will not stray from it - even as my heart quakes."
Gale,"Babe or crone, coward or hero, death is assured. Mystra's forgiveness is not. If you knew the end was near, would you not want to ensure it had meaning?"
Gale,I thought this place might bring me peace. I thought it might make the weight of what I must do feel a little lighter... but I am not so sure.
Gale,...and with company to match.
Gale,This may be my last night alive. I wanted it to be under a canopy of beauty and wonder...
Gale,So it is. But a very fine one. 
Gale,I wanted to see you. While I still could.
Gale,"I will be, soon. I am perhaps just one hard day away from being without any troubles at all."
Gale,"Resigned to it, rather. But that is not to say I am without fear. Far from it."
Gale,Good. Let's focus on the girl first. We can settle with the snake later.
Gale,He defies Mystra himself in saying so. He wouldn't do that without good reason.
Gale,She gives what she can. And you receive her aid gratefully.
Gale,Mystra soothes all pain.
Gale,I have your back.
Gale,"No other choice, I suppose."
Gale,"Yes, yes."
Gale,"Don't fret, I'm on my way."
Gale,How bothersome.
Gale,How tedious.
Gale,A waste of my talents.
Gale,In trouble? Small wonder.
Gale,Not this again.
Gale,There's always one.
Gale,"I'm indispensible, aren't I?"
Gale,One touch of magic coming up.
Gale,I have power enough to share - if I must.
Gale,One by one.
Gale,Checkmate.
Gale,The lesson is death.
Gale,Don't worry too much. A handful of powerful spells go a long way.
Gale,While the iron is hot.
Gale,Into the fray.
Gale,On my honour.
Gale,Danse macabre.
Gale,"Well I suppose it would do no good to back out now. Let us begin this little anthropological study, if we must."
Gale,A little help from a friend.
Gale,"I'd prefer you didn't do this. If I'm not enough for you, I could always conjure us some kind of non-sentient companion."
Gale,You can count on me.
Gale,Let them do their worst.<br>
Gale,"Swords, meet sorcery!"
Gale,A battle of wits.
Gale,Creator. Destroyer.
Gale,"Merely planning ahead. Besides, never hurts to befriend a wizard."
Gale,"In that case, I'd very much appreciate it if you could arrange an introduction should we reach the city."
Gale,Word in Waterdeep has it he's a bit of a cad. But you say he's an accomplished wizard?
Gale,"I've heard that name before. A young man, yes? Lives in Ramazith's Tower in the Upper City?"
Gale,This grove is like a cauldron about to boil over. I say we check in on the child - make sure she comes to no harm.
Gale,"Yes, of course."
Gale,Let us confer.
Gale,A little discourse.
Gale,With silver tongue.
Gale,My pleasure.
Gale,I can do that.
Gale,Up for debate.
Gale,A word.
Gale,Keep up! There's still a battle to be won.
Gale,Let them do their worst.
Gale,Surely you should be reserving your foot for more deserving foes? That poor creature was harmless!
Gale,My bedside manner is beyond reproach.
Gale,Never fear.
Gale,The light of life.
Gale,Keep up! There's still a battle to be won.<br>
Gale,Allow me.
Gale,"This is all a bit much for me. Back home in Waterdeep, I prefer to have Tara leave the room before I undress. "
Gale,I appreciate that - but I can't help how I feel. Sorry.
Gale,"I might enjoy watching you tangled up with the drow, as long as I was five paces back."
Gale,Where are my smelling salts?
Gale,Oh dear.
Gale,Willing and able.
Gale,No time to lose.
Gale,At once.
Gale,Curiouser and curiouser...
Gale,She might be right. You've drawn powers from a grim source.
Gale,"You will reward her faith in you. When the time comes, you will be ready."
Gale,"You will destroy the Absolute. Not for her, but for everyone else."
Gale,You'll learn more about the Heart. Only then will you decide.
Gale,She's going to be disappointed. You've no intention of dying.
Gale,You've been indulging yourself. No harm in that.
Gale,"Dangerous or not, you need all the help you can get."
Gale,She has no right to interfere. You don't answer to her.
Gale,"It could be sabotage, an attempt to deny you your chance at redemption..."
Gale,Impossible. Elminster's utterly devoted to her.
Gale,Useless trifles. She still keeps the Weave's true power for herself.
Gale,She forced her favours upon you. You owe her nothing.
Gale,"Her gifts have their uses, but she still leaves the hard work to you."
Gale,You are.
Gale,"Not for her, but for everyone else."
Gale,You'll die on nobody's orders. Especially not hers.
Gale,"No. If Elminster believes there's another way, so do you."
Gale,Quickly now.
Gale,Help's on the way.
Gale,On it.
Gale,Won't know what hit 'em.
Gale,You're adorable even when you're teasing me. But I must decline. 
Gale,I'd rather tangle with a dragon than get tangled in all those limbs.
Gale,"A stirring verse, to rouse heroes depleted.   
But not for us, because we went and cheated."
Gale,"Filial betrayal, is it? A tale as old as the gods themselves."
Gale,Perhaps she needs a moment. 
Gale,"I'm interested in the procedure, actually. Please, go ahead."
Gale,What are you doing? Stand back! Now!
Gale,Let's take a breath - the odds are stacked against us if we try to pick a fight now.
Gale,"Let's let cooler heads prevail, eh? I'm not sure I like our odds if we pick a fight here."
Gale,Don't - we'd face very poor odds if you start a fight now.
Gale,"Hmm. I can think of more trustworthy accomplices - more than a few, in fact."
Gale,Elminster's an enigma. Who knows what games he's playing.
Gale,"Ravengard hasn't given up yet. His true self is still in there, and could yet be saved."
Gale,"Is that... Tara? Why, I think it is!"
Gale,I think that's another tressym...
Gale,I'm rather a dab hand myself when it comes to a spot of intellectual intrigue...
Gale,"That was reckless. In a devil's hands, the crown could be as dangerous as any artefact in existence - we need to nullify the terms of that deal."
Gale,A spell a day...
Gale,Nemesis.
Gale,With glee.
Gale,I strike with precision.
Gale,Their worst nightmare.
Gale,Mine is the advantage.
Gale,On the double.
Gale,"A tad harsh, don't you think? Our fire will be no cooler just for sharing it with a child in need."
Gale,Rook to queen six.
Gale,"If nothing else, I hope it was a mercifully short one."
Gale,Pawn to cleric four.
Gale,"Say yes. But if words fail you, I'll accept a kiss."
Gale,No doubt it will be - abominably so. As is just about everything we do. But I know we're up to the task. What do you say...?
Gale,"It won't, I swear to you. It's merely a tool - a means to an end."
Gale,"You told me once to choose you, the one who loved me. That's what this is all about. Do you doubt me?"
Gale,You mean... you want the same as I do? 
Gale,I've never wanted to kiss you more than I do now.
Gale,"Then it will be so. With you and I together, there's not a force in existence that can stop us."
Gale,"But think what I offer. The vastness of eternity to explore, the Weave at our fingertips... You would really prefer me as I am?"
Gale,What more is there to be said?
Gale,"I hope you're right. I truly do. Godly power, perhaps I can live without, but you? You're everything."
Gale,You put the stars to shame. Let's sit here another while - I want to drink you in.
Gale,"You see me as I am, and do not find me wanting. With these stars as my witness, I swear - you will always be enough for me."
Gale,As you wish. Take a moment to soak the view. I doubt you will be privy to it again.
Gale,"A little boat voyage, that's all. Indulge me."
Gale,"I suppose if you see it that way... there's little else to be said, is there. Enjoy your evening."
Gale,Remain steadfast - there is nothing to fear from what awaits me. In fact... allow me to show you. Words alone are not enough.
Gale,But I could be so much more to you.
Gale,"Please, close your eyes a moment."
Gale,No doubt it will be - abominably so. As is just about everything we do. But I know we're up to the task. Are you still with me?
Gale,"Right now, I need nothing more than a kiss. Then we'll face what is to come, together. And claim the crown when the time comes."
Gale,"I'm sorry. It's not easy living for more than just yourself, when for so long just staying alive was accomplishment enough."
Gale,You stole the words from my mouth.
Gale,I don't think I deserve you at times. I told you of my ambitions - the likes of which many would baulk at - and yet you remain at my side.
Gale,"Words alone are not enough. Permit me to show you. Please, close your eyes a moment."
Gale,The Outer Planes. This is where gods dwell. Where they observe us from afar. Where they make play-things of us.
Gale,"They would keep all of this from us - the power, the possibilities. They only want us to serve them, pray to them... and ultimately, die for them."
Gale,"But what if we didn't need them? What if we wielded their power instead, and helped ourselves in all the ways they refuse to. I could make that happen. I could make this illusion a reality, with you by my side."
Gale,"I'll always have you, Karlach."
Gale,"How could I not crave this? But I don't want it for myself, alone - I want you at my side, willing and wholehearted."
Gale,Then have me - but have the best possible version of me.
Gale,"I've already defied Mystra. Had I followed her command, there'd be nothing left of me but a smoking crater."
Gale,"The tadpoles, the orb - these threats to our existence - the gods could aid us if they wished, but instead they cower behind Ao. So let us act ourselves."
Gale,"With the power of the crown, any foe would be rendered impotent. Any obstacle would be dwarfed by our might."
Gale,I used to believe Mystra's forgiveness was worth dying for. But I was wrong. You showed me just how much I have to live for. 
Gale,"With you, I forget my goddess. I love you."
Gale,Tell me you feel the same way. Tell me you want what I want. Please.
Gale,"Yes, you have. But I want more than your support. I want your heart."
Gale,There you are. I was worried you might have second thoughts after my little confrontation with Mystra.
Gale,"Most would think me foolish, deluded even, for daring to pursue dreams of wielding Karsus' Crown. I do not take your faith lightly."
Gale,"Ah, you've a moment for me? I was hoping to speak to you - I confess, my thoughts have been somewhat scattered since my audience with Mystra."
Gale,"Some mistakes can't be resolved with an apology. Some mistakes, you have to carry with you, forever."
Gale,You're smarter than that. It's part of what drew me to you.
Gale,"I'm smarter than that, and so are you. It's part of what drew me to you."
Gale,"I thought we shared something special, I truly did. Clearly I'm nothing but a smitten fool..."
Gale,"A fascinating question, one that boils down to which criteria we choose to apply. Are we speaking about the physiological? Theological? Etymological?"
Gale,"Oh. Then for your purposes, they are exactly the same."
Gale,Is that why you keep your head shaved? I assumed it was a custom of some sort.
Gale,"No, of course she didn't. Why would I want anyone but you...?"
Gale,"Thank you, but I'm more wizard than warrior. I'm not sure my scalp would stand up to such a plaiting."
Gale,"Yes, that would probably do it."
Gale,"Wonderful! The more, the merrier."
Gale,"Oh, come on, let her stay - we have room to spare."
Gale,We have room at the campfire yet - let the girl stay. I wouldn't want it said that I am any less than a perfect gentleman.
Gale,"Go to sleep. If another knife awaits in the night, so be it."
Gale,An astral projection. Seems she's taking no chances with us.
Gale,Betrayed by a drow commander of the Absolute. How unexpected a turn of events.
Gale,So their reputation suggests - especially among the good folk of Waterdeep. I'm curious to learn how you fell foul of them...
Gale,"I've... misjudged the situation. I gave my heart over to you too freely, and now it has been wounded. A mistake I shall not repeat."
Gale,"As you say. Perhaps others could turn the other cheek, but I'm not that sort. It's for the best - to spare further heartache."
Gale,You still have me as an ally... but anything beyond that was just a fleeting dream - one from which I have now awoken.
Gale,The Karsite Weave could offer more than just power - it could bestow divinity. If I only trust myself to wield it.
Gale,"I know this may not be the course you would choose for me, but before you protest - you should at least know what it is you would be advising against."
Gale,"A pity I did not learn all she had to offer, but the fact that she summoned me to her presence is proof enough that the Crown of Karsus is worth pursuing."
Gale,"I must admit, the Crown of Karsus has occupied my every thought since we learned of it. "
Gale,"If we can seize it, and use it... the possibilities are endless. Yet you haven't uttered a peep one way or the other about it."
Gale,"The power to change the world - it may be within our reach. You must have an opinion, surely."
Gale,"But I cannot. You would  not be able to either, if you knew what I knew. Please, allow me to show you. Just close your eyes a moment."
Gale,"Then the fault lies with me, and my inadequate words. Please, allow me to show you instead. Just close your eyes a moment."
Gale,Thanks for letting me stay.
Gale,Any particular reason you did?
Gale,Ah I see. Practical as ever.
Gale,"Well it's nice to be liked enough for people to choose horrible, necrotic death by your side, I guess."
Gale,I am really in a poor state. So tired. Might explode any day. Any night.
Gale,That was a very... passionate plea you held on my behalf.<br>Why so?
Gale,"I had hoped my eyes were deceiving me... but no. You were with her, weren't you?"
Gale,"Diminish my feelings if you wish, but do not expect me to take this lying down - that's more your style, from what I can tell. My trust in you is broken."
Gale,"If only your mind had been so set last night. But alas, that bell cannot be unrung."
Gale,"If that's true, it's thanks to you, and the trust you show in me at every turn of this strange adventure of ours."
Gale,"How does it feel to kill a woman still flush with the warmth of your body? All par for the course for you, I suppose."
Gale,Enjoy the rest of your evening.
Gale,"It was easier to stare at the celestial abyss than recognise the emptiness within myself. Easier to pretend my destiny lay among such stars, than work to salvage a life on solid ground. You changed all that."
Gale,Mystra. I never thought we'd speak again like this. Why am I here?
Gale,Not yet.
Gale,I didn't call on you to make small talk. You owe me an explanation.
Gale,I didn't come for small talk. Why did you summon me?
Gale,And you look radiant.
Gale,What can I say? Adventuring suits me.
Gale,I owe you no explanation. Not after how you've treated me.
Gale,"No thanks to you. I wasn't expecting a summons, but then you did always prefer things on your terms."
Gale,No wizard worth their hat would destroy such a powerful artefact without first understanding it.
Gale,"I understand now why you asked what you did. I should use the orb, and ensure Karsus' powers are truly destroyed."
Gale,"Very well. The next time we meet, I'll be bringing you the Crown."
Gale,"You're the mother of all magic, the Weave incarnate. Can't you just destroy the Crown yourself?"
Gale,Is that why you lied to me about the Crown of Karsus? Self-preservation?
Gale,You're one to talk. How many innocents were you prepared to sacrifice if I detonated the orb?
Gale,Then why did you strip me of my abilities? I could have put things right.
Gale,I never intended to do harm. Only to prove myself worthy of you.
Gale,I don't know. I need time to think.
Gale,"So that's what you're scared of. The magic within me is one you can't control. But with the Crown of Karsus, I could."
Gale,"I didn't want to die. And when I saw the Crown, I thought I might not have to, if I only understood its power."
Gale,"I won't let you down again. When the Absolute is vanquished, I will surrender Karsus' powers to you. You have my word."
Gale,"You're right. I am a strong, capable wizard. And this is no more than a casual reunion with an ex-lover. "
Gale,Am I?
Gale,Time was I'd have given my right arm for a chance to speak with Mystra again. The left one too. Maybe a knee...
Gale,"It's a summoning channel, the kind Mystra once used to call me to her side. I only have to reach for it, and it will take me to her side."
Gale,Strange... Do you feel that? It's as though the Weave itself is rushing past us...
Gale,"A stream of pure, undiluted Weave. I only have to reach out, and it will carry me to Mystra, wherever she may be."
Gale,The old man wasn't lying. She's opened a summoning channel. Can't you feel it?
Gale,Well somebody had to. You weren't exactly forthcoming with any offers of help.
Gale,"A word, if you please."
Gale,"Clearly the matter has hardly been a priority of yours, but even so, you can consider it closed."
Gale,"I no longer require assistance - neither yours, nor that of artefacts."
Gale,"Because you had no right to ask that of me. You cast me out, remember?"
Gale,You abandoned me in my hour of greatest need. I had no obligation to help you in yours.
Gale,"So that's what you're scared of. With the Crown of Karsus reforged, I could take control of the Karsite Weave."
Gale,A great ask indeed. You've given me much to think on - as you always did.
Gale,"Not happening. When I get my hands on that Crown, I'm going to wield it. Karsus' powers will be mine."
Gale,Remember how I told you I was in dire need of magical artefacts to absorb?
Gale,Our relationship bored you. The orb was just an excuse to end it.
Gale,You were threatened. You realised you couldn't control me.
Gale,"I let you down. I was a fool, and fools don't deserve the love of a goddess."
Gale,Good night.
Gale,"I owe you an apology. Things became quite heated between us before, after I learned of the Crown of Karsus. I allowed myself to get carried away, and failed to properly explain myself."
Gale,Thank you. But I owe you more than that. I need to help you understand just what this could mean for us.
Gale,When are we not doing something dangerous? Give me a chance - I think I can help you understand.
Gale,I can't. Your opinion matters greatly to me. Give me a chance - I think I can help you understand.
Gale,Ah. You're still talking to me then?
Gale,"I wouldn't blame you for giving me a wide berth. I thought the orb's ever-present censure had tamed my wilder ambition, but that wasn't the case."
Gale,"Not really, no."
Gale,"I needed Mystra's intervention. She offered me a path to redemption at last, and it might yet leave my mind and body intact."
Gale,That's all I ever need to hear.
Gale,"I know what I must do. The Crown belongs under Mystra's stewardship, not mine, and I will ensure she gets it."
Gale,That means there'll be no permanent place in the heavens for us. But we could still visit.  
Gale,Astra navigabimus.
Gale,Few mortals ever glimpse what you're about to see. But don't be alarmed - I'm here with you. Now... open your eyes.
Gale,"Quite the view, isn't it? The Outer Planes are a place of profound, sometimes overwhelming possibility."
Gale,"I conjured this illusion often during my confinement in Waterdeep. An escape for the mind, where there was none for the body."
Gale,"Please - continue to believe in me. I want to show you the wizard I am capable of being, rather than the poor excuse for a man who's kept you company thus far."
Gale,"Up to old tricks again, are we?"
Gale,"In my mind, you are quite blind."
Gale,No matter. All you see is what I want you to see.
Gale,Because I disobeyed you. You punished me for it.
Gale,"I was a danger to you. What I did, or rather, attempted to do, was reckless."
Gale,I was afraid. Afraid to die. Afraid that I might fail.
Gale,Because my life isn't yours to throw away. You had no right to ask that of me.
Gale,Because I have someone else to live for.
Gale,Mystra. Please - I have so much to explain to you.
Gale,Reach out. Go to Mystra.
Gale,Not at all.
Gale,"I've had a solution in mind for a while now, it just took me some time to... set it in motion."
Gale,That's it - I won't take more of your time this lovely evening. Rest well.
Gale,Stop that! How dare you...
Gale,Forget whatever it was you saw. It's all beyond you now anyway.
Gale,No more than what I had to - and that's all I'll say on the matter.
Gale,Much later. If ever.
Gale,Suit yourself. Like I said: I no longer require your assistance.
Gale,Stop that! How dare you - again...
Gale,"Up to tricks, are we?"
Gale,No matter. Far be it for me to impose the majesty of the celestial canvas on those unwilling to partake of its beauty.
Gale,"My omnipotent, omniscient ex-lover..."
Gale,But no matter. What's one more kill but a fitting coda to a day of carnage?
Gale,Massacre. A spectacle of slaughter. And I participated.
Gale,I'm sure she at least stuffs her fingers in her ears to muffle my invocations.
Gale,"A common enough interpretation. Sickness has a nasty habit of making you feel trapped, if only within the confines of your own body."
Gale,When you've loved a goddess - as I have - people often think you less experienced in the ways of romance.
Gale,Ah. If that's the main criteria then I shall reset my expectations accordingly. Water it is.
Gale,A bar is only as good as its cellars. Which vintages can we expect to find on their racks?
Gale,What can I say? Mother always taught me to be a gracious host.
Gale,Thank you. Any particular reason? 
Gale,"I once spent weeks convalescing in the Hospice of St Laupsenn after a nasty bout of ruddy pox. For all their kindness, leaving that place behind felt like freedom to me."
Gale,"Magic from the fallen empire of Netheril. Ancient, exceedingly dangerous, and quite unrivalled."
Gale,"This is sobering news indeed, but there's no use crying over spilt milk. If this is our only option, to Moonrise Towers we go."
Gale,As did Mystra's home on Elysium. Her ribbed vaults and buttresses created a magic entirely of their own. Not to mention her pleasure domes...
Gale,I've said enough. Let silence do the talking.
Gale,"There's promise in patience, I assure you. Let the night run its course so that we can run ours as well."
Gale,Enjoy the night. It seems to me full of opportunities.
Gale,There's that confidence I like.
Gale,I thank you for seeking me out. Amid all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening.
Gale,"That expression must sound curious to a githyanki ear, given the way they're birthed."
Gale,"Were our bond a little stronger, I might even have shared a moment of magic with you. "
Gale,Doesn't seem to trouble you a jot.
Gale,"Unlikely. Had I stayed there much longer, the orb would have reduced it to rubble. Besides, think of all the fun I'd have missed out on."
Gale,There is poetry to be found in even the dingiest of holes.
Gale,"Everything, really - not to put too fine a point on it."
Gale,On occasion.
Gale,Tenacity might be a kinder word for it.
Gale,You are lucky to have left that anger behind.
Gale,"Then we hope our mutual strengths are enough to dominate them. Or, we die nobly in the attempt."
Gale,There is nothing more to be done here. High time we left.
Gale,The road to Baldur's Gate is a long one. Who knows how long it'll take these folks to get there on foot?
Gale,"For the best. They may not be the safest types to unleash, but their deaths would have weighed heavy on you."
Gale,"Leave it, Astarion. The butcher's bill is too steep, no matter what power it grants you."
Gale,Those scars... great pain's been visited upon you. I'm sorry.
Gale,"No, Astarion, do not speak those words! The cost is too great!"
Gale,"You chose well. They may not be the safest types to unleash, but their deaths would have weighed heavy on you."
Gale,"All gone, just like that... I hope it was worth it."
Gale,That power isn't worth so many lives - trust me.
Gale,"All enemies have some chink in their armour, no matter how much they like to believe themselves invulnerable. That's what we must find."
Gale,All those lives... was it truly worth it?
Gale,"Alas, our fledgling acquaintanceship has not yet taken flight. Such intimacy will have to wait."
Gale,I was hoping you'd spare me a moment. There was something rather magical I wished to show you.
Gale,A lesson. And trust me when I say - few have experienced the pleasure I offer to teach.
Gale,And that's just the beginning. I have so much more to show you...
Gale,Close your eyes.
Gale,Then follow my lead.
Gale,Your domain will come to you as you settle into divinity. I can't wait to see what you'll become.
Gale,"That is for you to decide, my love. Ambition made me what I am. What drives you, we have yet to discover."
Gale,"He'll be back. The question is, will he find us side by side?"
Gale,"I hit him where he's most vulnerable - pricked his pride, and sent him back to the Hells to lick his wounds."
Gale,You aren't? That's... disappointing.
Gale,The question is - do you wish to go with me? To become a god at my side?
Gale,I rather think I can. Ta-ta for now.
Gale,"You can have the Crown, Raphael. But you'll need to come and collect it from my realm."
Gale,I thought you liked playing games?
Gale,"But it's more than that to me. It's my domain, and I think in your case I'll bend the rules and make things a little more interesting for both of us."
Gale,Ambition is your bread and bloody butter.
Gale,But here's where we differ. You have lofty goals and the Crown is the key to them - you're desperate to get your claws on it.
Gale,We have something in common after all. Ambition.
Gale,That was immensely satisfying. I need to go and prepare for him to come knocking at my door.
Gale,"Then this is goodbye, I suppose."
Gale,"Jealousy is in the eye of the beholder. Or something along those lines, the wine might be befuddling me a smidge."
Gale,"Now please, go and enjoy your evening. this won't be the first party I've spent moping in self-indulgence with a bottle of wine for company."
Gale,"However, it's something best experienced in more intimate surrounds, once the revelry has ended, and the stillness of the night has been restored."
Gale,"For now - please, enjoy the celebration. When it is done, I will show you all."
Gale,As they say in Waterdeep: in wine there is truth.
Gale,That's usually followed by: in water there is good sense.
Gale,"I promise you - my offer is a perfectly sober one. So, what do you say?"
Gale,Too bad. One should never be afraid to live life to the fullest.
Gale,"More's the pity you've already found someone else to make merry with, just the two of you."
Gale,"He has a certain charm about him, Astarion. Then again, so does a tiger when it purrs."
Gale,You might be in for an adventure with Karlach. More than you bargained for - with a bit of luck.
Gale,Or perhaps more than you bargained for - full stop.
Gale,"Lae'zel. Blade like a razor, wit like a razor, tongue like a razor."
Gale,I do hope you know what you're doing.
Gale,"Far be it from me of course, to question your tastes."
Gale,"That, my friend, must remain a secret. For now. Or rather: for as long as you've eyes only for someone else among our troupe."
Gale,Another night perhaps.
Gale,"Caught on to that, did you? Might be the wine talking."
Gale,The point is - I have hope. Each new sunrise may yet be the one to coax our budding bond to blossom. But I think it's fair to say -  it won't be today's.
Gale,"Not at all. Why, some of the finest artists and musicians began their careers amidst stale beer and sticky floors."
Gale,"This is the worst moment. When the screams of the dying have faded, and the conquering hordes howl and yelp as they come to their vile climax."
Gale,Not a devil in sight. How disappointing.
Gale,No signs of tentacles so far.
Gale,"Thank you, Tara. I really needed this."
Gale,"I'm not sure, Tara. It's dangerous out here."
Gale,How did you find me?
Gale,You need to go home - now. And that's final.
Gale,"It's good to see you, Tara. I've missed you very much."
Gale,Don't get used to it. You need to go back to Waterdeep. Now.
Gale,"Well, well, well. Look what the tressym dragged in."
Gale,Dare I ask what you're doing here?
Gale,Minthara. To sleep with her is to dream of death. Plenty of that to go around.
Gale,I've found love. Surely even you wouldn't begrudge me some happiness.
Gale,"You're about to say something awful, aren't you?"
Gale,"A mind flayer monarch, imagine that. Such a thing could shatter worlds."
Gale,Perhaps you'll understand me better when you know the truth of my condition.
Gale,"No - a night like this is unfit to bear witness to such a tale. It's unfit for most things. Now please - permit me some peace amidst this vile revelry. We'll speak, but another time. "
Gale,"You will. But not until then. Now please - I'd prefer to be alone with my regrets. Enjoy these vile revelries, if that's your inclination. It certainly isn't mine."
Gale,"I thought the orb to be the greatest of my sins, but I see now there are darker depths to which I might yet sink. You may be content to sink into that abyss, but I assure you - I am not. "
Gale,"Bloodshed by day, bloodshed by night. What a jolly bloody life we lead."
Gale,At what cost? Are our lives truly worth so many others?
Gale,"In fact, I think I feel as bad as I look."
Gale,"I can look after myself, Tara."
Gale,What are these bloody stumps that used to be such delicate harpists of the Weave?
Gale,Two shadows are darkening my soul. The shadow within and the shadow without:
Gale,You.<br>
Gale,You led me down this path.
Gale,But at what cost?
Gale,"I don't know myself anymore. All this... It's not who I am. Around you, I'm not who I want to be."
Gale,I should leave.
Gale,"Goodness, I'd forgotten. Thank the gods you reminded me before I starved to death."
Gale,"Precious little love lost between us, isn't there?"
Gale,"Yes. Yes, I suppose we do. Few things are more powerful than the will to live."
Gale,"But carnage such as this... The shadow within is spreading like poison, corrupting kindness and compassion."
Gale,"She hardly seems a danger to us. Let the girl stay, if she's desperate enough to think our troupe good company."
Gale,"Consider that it'll explode, flattening an area larger than Waterdeep."
Gale,Cast your mind elsewhere.
Gale,"Think of Mystra, goddess of magic."
Gale,Tara! Is that you?!
Gale,All the more blood.
Gale,I can see the answer in your eyes. And that's why I'm leaving.
Gale,Gods damn you - you're right. Few things are more powerful than the will to live.
Gale,"What chances I have, I'll take them. I'd rather roll the dice than deliver all this death."
Gale,"She's finally decided to get involved, has she? About bloody time."
Gale,Very well. I'll seek her statue at the Tabernacle.
Gale,"Oh, nothing in particular. Some charms here, some potions there..."
Gale,You don't seem all that surprised to see me alive and well.
Gale,A way to destroy the Absolute without using the orb. I hope.
Gale,"If it was up to her, I'd be a pile of ash along with the rest of the shadow-cursed lands by now. I can't imagine what she has to say to me. 'Sorry', perhaps."
Gale,"The truth, Elminster. How Karsus' Crown could yet be reforged. Or destroyed, as the case may be."
Gale,That sounds dangerous. I thought she wanted me dead?
Gale,Strange things are happening to us. What festers in our minds may well impel our bodies.
Gale,I'll take that comment with the sincerity and good will I assume it was intended.
Gale,"Oh, nowhere. I just think it a rather cruel misnomer. Not at all reflective of the glamour wizarding life affords."
Gale,Tempting. But I think we might already have the maximum number of theatrical titles.
Gale,I take it you have some suggestions?
Gale,"How long have you been pacted to Mizora, Wyll?"
Gale,It's in a devil's nature to conceal the truth - you can't fault yourself for that.
Gale,True enough. But an illithid pod? That would probably do the trick.
Gale,We'd be wise to fear the trees themselves. It feels like the forest itself longs for our destruction.
Gale,I don't need Mystra's help. I can defeat the Absolute without her.
Gale,"Whatever Mystra has to say to me, it's far too late. I'm getting that Crown."
Gale,I learned how to reforge the Crown of Karsus. And I'm going to do it.
Gale,It's time to stop making excuses.
Gale,Don't blame me for detesting them.
Gale,"You really are absolutely heartless, aren't you?"
Gale,I've said my piece. Now let me dull my tongue with wine.
Gale,"Mystra hasn't seemed inclined to hand out second chances so far. None she'd have me survive, anyway."
Gale,And why exactly  should Mystra have any say on what I do with Crown?
Gale,"The past is the past, Elminster. And the future is... well, still to be decided. By me, not by Mystra."
Gale,"Mystra's willing to speak to me again? Was this your doing, Elminster?"
Gale,I'm curious enough to make the attempt. All right - an audience with the mother of magic it is.
Gale,"Perhaps they do. Would you begrudge me the chance to make things right, Elminster?"
Gale,"Perhaps she does. Would you begrudge me the chance to make things right, Elminster?"
Gale,"Perhaps he does. Would you begrudge me the chance to make things right, Elminster?"
Gale,Perhaps it would have been better to keep that particular opportunity between ourselves...
Gale,"What are you saying? Or rather, what are you not saying?"
Gale,You have a better suggestion? I'm all ears.
Gale,"If I can exploit the Crown's powers, I could defeat the Absolute in an instant. We'd never fear their like again."
Gale,"I was destined for greatness, Elminster. This might be my only chance to take it."
Gale,That I can relate to.
Gale,"Not the message one hopes to receive from a past lover. But her first love was always the Weave. At best, I was a close second."
Gale,"Thankfully not. Though she's not been averse to demanding the odd human sacrifice in recent days, has she?"
Gale,"When I pictured this moment, I thought I'd feel more in control. Yet here I am, with palms sweatier than a bugbear's armpit."
Gale,Blast scars. Spell and sword alike were used to ravage this battlefield.
Gale,"Tell me, Lae'zel, what is it like on the Astral Plane? Your home realm intrigues me."
Gale,"What they sell is far more precious than mere sword or shield. They sell knowledge, ingenuity, the wisdom of mages past."
Gale,Look around you. Indulge your curiosity. Sorcerous Sundries is the finest purveyor of magical miscellany for miles around.
Gale,"Am I to understand that you are in love now, Karlach?"
Gale,"Passionate, primal, capable of bestowing the most life-affirming comfort, or inflicting the profoundest damage."
Gale,"I've always felt flames to be a rather perfect expression of love, Karlach."
Gale,"I'd rather not, if it's all the same to you."
Gale,"Actually, I was thinking of poetry."
Gale,"Of course, but that doesn't make the shadows less dangerous."
Gale,"Do you feel that? A darkness, pulling at the strands of the Weave. "
Gale,"No matter - what she doesn't know can't hurt her. Not at this distance, anyway. "
Gale,Ah. That will make getting word to my mother rather tricky.
Gale,I don't suppose you've any clue where we are in relation to Waterdeep?
Gale,"A hidden shrine, dedicated to the Moon Maiden herself. Even amidst this darkness, Selunites are stubborn enough to cling on."
Gale,"You've quite the knack for finding the bright side of things, haven't you?"
Gale,"You know, Karlach, there are other ways to express love beyond run-of-the-mill physicality..."
Gale,The architects who built this must have been remarkable. A pity their vision didn't stand the test of time.
Gale,I always wondered what a vampire's lair would look like. Can't say I pictured it being quite this... theatrical.
Gale,"Not to diminish our efforts, but it was rather simple getting here in the end, wasn't it?"
Gale,Let's never speak of this again.
Gale,"I found an empty bottle of venom in camp, Minthara. Safe to assume it was yours?"
Gale,So you admit you've found love! How delightful - I'm happy for you both.
Gale,"I'm glad to know you have a softer side, Minthara. I was beginning to think you rather heartless."
Gale,"Flying hounds? Come now - you're pulling my leg, aren't you? "
Gale,"Pigeons, gulls, sparrows - these streets make a fine hunting ground for a tressym like Tara."
Gale,"Similar to the Astral Plane in some ways, wouldn't you say, Lae'zel?"
Gale,That makes sense. She does have a flair for the dramatic.
Gale,"No day, no night. It's as though time itself has abandoned this place."
Gale,"I hoped Moonrise would give me answers, but at every twist of its corridors I find only more questions..."
Gale,"Tell me, Lae'zel, is it common for githyanki to fall in love?"
Gale,"I've been pondering something, Lae-zel. Why is it that githyanki have belly-buttons, when they hatch from eggs?"
Gale,I can't imagine Mother Gith would approve. Doesn't she prefer us lesser species enslaved? Or eviscerated?
Gale,I'm surprised you're permitted to choose a partner outside of your own people.
Gale,"The Weave is constant, but its users? Anything but. We must be on our guard."
Gale,"There's magic here, but it's of a rancid, impure form. Nothing like the true Weave at all."
Gale,"Ambiguity does not come naturally to you, does it Lae'zel? Your life must be far simpler for it."
Gale,And without so much as a stirring from our tadpoles.
Gale,Nothing like a brisk stroll through the forest to invigorate the spirit.
Gale,"Make no mistake. Souls are sold for coins up here as well. All too cheaply, in most cases."
Gale,"Time. Or rather: the absence of it. In the Astral Plane, everything is eternal."
Gale,"He's patriarch of the Szarr family. Nasty fellow, if the histories are accurate."
Gale,"If you must indulge yourself like that, please do it quietly."
Gale,Is that so? I assumed there to be little time for frivolity amongst all the fighting.
Gale,Not everyone approaches the raising of their young with such militaristic vigour.
Gale,That's certainly one way to make them behave...
Gale,They're not mutually exclusive. The Weave is served best with a dash of eloquence.
Gale,"Ah, so you're susceptible to the tragedy of a broken home. Maybe you've more in common with us weaker beings than you thought..."
Gale,"Indeed. More than simple craft, it's a way of life for some of them."
Gale,"Tell me, Lae'zel, when you say we might be 'purified' at your crèche, what does that mean exactly?"
Gale,Condoning the slaughter of the weak? Not the most charitable perspective to take.
Gale,"Indulge me, Lae'zel. As someone unfettered by Faerûnian beauty standards, how would you appraise my appearance?"
Gale,And deprive them of the pleasure of hearing my nocturnal postulations? I'd never be so cruel.
Gale,The mind absorbs much while we believe ourselves dormant. To lie beside Gale of Waterdeep is positively educational.
Gale,"I was wondering about your queen, Vlaakith. What tales of her reach us are terrifying, but I suppose that's not how you would describe her."
Gale,If you'd be so kind!
Gale,Hardly the worst atrocity the Absolute's committed.
Gale,"I'm telling you, this is a mistake."
Gale,An over-confident appraisal. I'll show them the flaws in their design.
Gale,"If I understood their script, who knows what secrets their texts would surrender..."
Gale,"They say wealth offers a form of magic. Alas, it's one I've rarely dabbled in."
Gale,On the Absolute's behalf? Now there's an alliance I'd have been quite happy without.
Gale,"It strikes me that, for a mind flayer colony, there are remarkably few mind flayers about the place..."
Gale,Nor should you. Far better to feel a cool breeze on your skin than whatever foul expirations blow through these halls.
Gale,"Gods, who knew such a vile abcess lurked in the bedrock of the city. The very stone reeks of misery and despair."
Gale,"Oh no. Quite the opposite, actually. She mostly preferred our interactions to be abstract and incorporeal. Most invigorating."
Gale,"Wildshaping must sprinkle some spice on your love life, Halsin."
Gale,"Home and hearth, reduced to ruins. The shadow curse stole more than the light from this place."
Gale,"You never felt the call of the divine, Astarion?"
Gale,"Mystra has a shrine within the city. Located in the Stormshore Tabernacle, if my memory serves me."
Gale,"If you're feeling faint after your bout with Cazador, Astarion, I don't mind donating some blood."
Gale,"I trust you speak of the bonds of love, and not the shackles of servitude."
Gale,"So, Astarion. I hear your relationship has taken on a new aspect recently..."
Gale,"One heartbreak was quite enough for me, but to experience it as many times as you have must change a person."
Gale,"I fear I've been rather hasty to judge you, Astarion."
Gale,"Tell me, do you always woo your lovers with such patient attention?"
Gale,"I see you waste no time pursing your quarry, Astarion."
Gale,"My, my. Well I'll say this for the Bonecloaks - they know their mushrooms."
Gale,"Your prowess in battle is remarkable, as is your battle stance itself."
Gale,A by-product of their profession. Few can spend a lifetime inhaling fungal spores without turning out a bit muddled between the ears.
Gale,"Pragmatism, thy name is Shadowheart. You're not wrong though - best we keep our sojourn here to a minimum."
Gale,"Aha, transfusion! An interesting strategy. Hard to get hold of a god's blood, of course, but if one could..."
Gale,She needs sleep. And she needs to be closely guarded.
Gale,Careful! She's about to lash out.
Gale,I'm in a spot of bother here!<br>
Gale,Quickly - don't let me down!
Gale,Downed and soon to be out!
Gale,For all our sakes - help me up!
Gale,"Did I say interesting? I meant terrible, of course. A terrible strategy..."
Gale,"City's teem with life. Rats, pigeons, flies - they count no less, for all their more pestilent qualities."
Gale,"Ah. Well, there's no faulting that logic. At least you didn't tell me to 'be myself'."
Gale,"Anything you'd like to pass on to a strapping, love-struck wizard such as myself?"
Gale,"Halsin, you must have accumulated considerable wisdom on matters of the heart in your long life."
Gale,"Divination is a skill few can master. The rest of us must simply muddle along, content to view the past with a clarity the future rarely offers."
Gale,I'm not sure Ketheric Thorm would prove the most bounteous of bodies...
Gale,I imagine the vista was more idyllic back then. As were its patrons' chances of surviving the walk home.
Gale,A hand!
Gale,"Not too soon, I hope. I've a craving for a soft bed, a hot bath and a large glass of Arabellan Dry - none of which I've ever found hidden under a log."
Gale,A little help!
Gale,"No book or painting could ever do its strange beauty justice. But perhaps our stories might, when we return to the surface."
Gale,With my reflexes? I'd catch you before you so much as stubbed a toe.
Gale,She who thirsts buys drinks the first.
Gale,She who declines gets the worst of the wines.
Gale,"It was known to be quite the tipple - a cask or two still exists, if you know the right alekeep..."
Gale,A common misconception. Even the simplest of flavours are elevated by the choice to appreciate them. Don't deny yourself such pleasures.
Gale,"It's the stairs I'm dreading. I shall close my eyes, and pretend I'm climbing my own, far superior tower in Waterdeep."
Gale,And give the Absolute free reign to use us as target practice from the banks? I think not.
Gale,There used to be a monastery in this region known for producing a wonderful ale.
Gale,"Fear not, Karlach. Sun, moon and stars will still be there waiting for us."
Gale,Karlach... a hypothetical question for you:
Gale,Talking. Right. I'm good at that.
Gale,You can read?!
Gale,Say no more - I'll find the perfect book for you. I might even lend it to you from my library in Waterdeep.
Gale,"Oh, quite well as a matter of fact. Since it was stabilised, it's been humming along nicely."
Gale,"I have noticed one adverse side-effect. I seem to be losing hair in some, er, unexpected places."
Gale,"Oh, you know... Still alive and kicking, despite being surrounded on all sides by an endless manifestation of darkness and decay..."
Gale,"You wouldn't be the first, I'd wager. It's been some time since these walkways felt the carpenter's hammer."
Gale,"If someone - not me, of course - detected a hint of romantic interest in them from another, unnamed individual, what might that someone do about it? "
Gale,A tollhouse like this would only be merited in the most prosperous of settlements. This was once a thriving trade route.
Gale,Almost worth the subterfuge.
Gale,You've asked the right wizard. My oratory skills have left many a wedding guest weeping in their seat.
Gale,Guess it's mine now.
Gale,Nothing wrong with a bit of friction now and then. You help me keep my mind sharp.
Gale,"There you go, cutting right through the ephemera to the heart of the matter. Your finest quality, I think."
Gale,"Even shaped by shadow as it is, Sharran architecture has a kind of beauty to it."
Gale,I don't like that I'm so good at this.
Gale,I'm sure. But you might have learned from my experience. The gods demand more than vows when calling followers to the altar...
Gale,"So, you decided to bind yourself to your goddess, Shadowheart..."
Gale,"Gondian artificers might lack a certain worldly wisdom, but there's no doubting they're masters of their craft."
Gale,Might fetch a copper or two.
Gale,Of course. There's nothing escapes a wizard's powers of observation.
Gale,"When we met, Shadowheart, your gaze seemed to linger in the distance on some unseen goal, some insubstantial purpose."
Gale,Look at this place. Such horrors defy description...
Gale,A little keepsake.
Gale,I really shouldn't have.
Gale,I take it you're not inclined to study the wonders of the underdark?
Gale,The Society of Brilliance has quite the reputation. Even Waterdhavian academics refer to their works from time to time.
Gale,The ablutions offered at the Temple of Beauty in Waterdeep are far superior. And they have the most excellent soaps.
Gale,I admire any who follow their curiosity to novel and unexpected means. This is how the world changes for the better.
Gale,Pretty.
Gale,The history of the city itself is captured in the archives here - a fascinating resource.
Gale,I've been known to trip the light fantastic myself. Mine was a popular hand at the annual Blackstaff's Ball.
Gale,"I knew you were a graceful man, Wyll, but I hear you're quite the dancer too."
Gale,Ill-gotten gains are still gains.
Gale,"If your natural charm isn't quite up to scratch, Wyll, there are magical means of adding a little flourish of charisma."
Gale,You've seen it for yourself?
Gale,These cragged hillls make for weary soles. I see why most headed inland prefer the smooth sailing of the Chionthar.
Gale,Some possessions are naught but a burden.
Gale,"My money's on you, Wyll. "
Gale,"Whatever the outcome of what's just ahead, it will be the stuff of legends."
Gale,I'll just keep this safe.
Gale,"Your confidence is encouraging but a little premature. Let's keep our eyes on the task ahead. Or eye, as the case may be."
Gale,"Moonrise Towers lies ahead. We're nearing the Heart of the Absolute, I'm certain of it."
Gale,A pretty bauble.
Gale,No need for such a grim assumption. Halsin helped many to escape these shadows before the town was consumed.
Gale,The masons here thought they were building something to last. How wrong they were.
Gale,That was easy.
Gale,"Only the most excellent and complimentary things. With some encouragement from us, of course."
Gale,"Whatever I expected to find lurking in this cursed gloom, it certainly wasn't this. A glimmer of hope amidst the darkness."
Gale,"I'll pass, thank you. I prefer Abjuration over acrobatics."
Gale,Please - time is of the essence!
Gale,Give them nine hells.<br>
Gale,What other choice do I have?
Gale,That's more magnanimous of her than I've grown accustomed to. The catch being?
Gale,Keep listening.
Gale,Must have been his simulacrum you bested. He always was a cautious traveller.
Gale,I don't understand. How so on my behalf?
Gale,Elminster.
Gale,I could debate you on that.
Gale,"I am Mystra's servant. If this is what she asks of me, so be it."
Gale,I can't say that so far I've volunteered the entire truth.
Gale,He is not. But it seems that Mystra is.
Gale,I'm glad it's not just me.
Gale,No indeed. But I think she trusts me to.
Gale,"It's all right, Elminster. If ever gallows humour were appropriate, this is its grim-smiling hour."
Gale,"On my honour, I'm not sure yet I can say the same."
Gale,Or some other fortune altogether.
Gale,"Farewell, Elminster. I'm glad she chose you."
Gale,"Not in so many words, no."
Gale,Nor would I expect you to. It is too bleak a task to demand of anyone.
Gale,I could possibly put an end to the Absolute - if you aided me.
Gale,You mean the orb. You mean I sacrifice myself.
Gale,"Elminster's not around, so might as well.<br>"
Gale,I have the magic touch.<br>
Gale,Quite ready for you.<br>
Gale,"Stormy introduction aside, might I suggest a partnership instead? The Blade of Frontiers would make a formidable ally."
Gale,I'm sure Gortash will be eager to learn of his rival's demise.
Gale,I'd advise against satisfying your hunger on me. Who knows what the orb might do if it realises its host is the one being drained.
Gale,Are you sure we should be trusting him?
Gale,"You promised me plain talk, Elminster. Make it plainer still, or we're done here."
Gale,Lost in thought.<br>
Gale,Which way to the nearest library?
Gale,"Lovely day, this. For now."
Gale,The air is ripe with magic.
Gale,Say nothing. Wait for him to explain himself.
Gale,Mystra sent you? Why? 
Gale,"You underestimate me, Elminster. 'She' could be any number of acquaintances."
Gale,Mystra would consider... forgiveness?
Gale,I applaud your taste.<br>
Gale,"By circumstance, but not by purpose, I swear. I never intended you any harm."
Gale,Mystra's delicate feet are ill-suited for the hardships of the road.
Gale,Thank you for that most considerate reminder.
Gale,Mystra won't be the one issuing the orders for much longer. She'll know exactly who's coming for her.
Gale,With pleasure. It's not often one has the chance to threaten a goddess and make good on it.
Gale,"I'd pray that she'll be in a forgiving mood, if she weren't the one I'd be praying to."
Gale,"You're right. A heartfelt apology is the surest way to a goddess' heart, and her favour."
Gale,Wait for me. Please.
Gale,I'll only be gone for a matter of moments. The Outer Planes experience time quite differently to our own. 
Gale,"I'll let Mystra show her flight, and then I can see how strong a chance we stand of winning the gambit."
Gale,"This won't take long, and when I'm done, I'll be free of Mystra's yoke once and for all."
Gale,I think it's best I keep a cool head going into this. Approach it like a particularly high-risk round of Three-Dragon Ante.
Gale,The summoning channel Mystra has provided is one only I can enter. No matter how much I'd prefer not to face her alone.
Gale,"The summoning channel Mystra has provided is for me alone. No one else is permitted to enter it, no matter how talented a user of the Weave they are."
Gale,"Alas, recent events have rendered the majority of it moot, so I'm going to have to improvise. Unless you have any words of wisdom to impart before I go?"
Gale,"During my time locked away in Waterdeep, I prepared a quite comprehensive speech for her on the subject of our former relationship, and the manner in which it ended."
Gale,It was intoxicating. An experience beyond expression.
Gale,"You know what it is to worship her, to respect her, to love her..."
Gale,I always wondered what being nervous would feel like. I hate it.
Gale,"Mystra's forgiveness? If you want me to claim the Crown of Karsus, she'll hardly be in a forgiving mood after that."
Gale,"It's one thing for us to actually pursue the Crown. I'm not entirely sure I want to threaten Mystra with the prospect on her own turf, so to speak."
Gale,"You'd make a fine Three-Dragon Ante player, you know."
Gale,What do you mean? I've been waiting for an opportunity like this since long before our paths crossed. 
Gale,"The long-awaited question. Now - if you please, Elminster - for the too-long-awaited answer."
Gale,A perfect score. It seems you know me better than I know myself.
Gale,"This is your quarry, Wyll? Less devilish than I had anticipated."
Gale,"Stand down, Wyll. She may add a little extra spice to her language, but she's no devil."
Gale,"She's, erm, perhaps a little rough around the edges... but I suppose I can be smooth enough for two..."
Gale,We're a long way from Waterdeep.
Gale,"Well, we all have a monster inside us of one sort or another."
Gale,"You say all the right words, but I'm not so sure you mean the right things. Still, I will respect the decision that was made."
Gale,"You have more faith in her than even I did... Understandable, though, when you have not loved her as deeply, or known the depths of her affections."
Gale,Oh that hardly matters. There's not much further I could fall in Mystra's estimation. But I'd like to at least leave her with something to think about.
Gale,"For a wizard, to have the love of the goddess of magic herself... "
Gale,"No doubt you yourself have sought Mystra's wisdom from time to time, but to not only receive her blessings, but her love... "
Gale,"I don't suppose you can imagine what it's like, to have your god as your lover..."
Gale,"Confident almost to the point of arrogance I may be, but in this matter I know she'll have wisdom to share. As for whether I choose to act upon it... we shall see."
Gale,I'm sure she has nothing pertinent to share whatsoever.
Gale,"Fine. If you're so against the idea, I suppose we can forge ahead without input from the goddess of magic."
Gale,"This is my only opportunity to learn the truth. About the Crown, the orb, all of it. Why try to keep me from it?"
Gale,You have my attention.<br>
Gale,Seek and you shall find me.<br>
Gale,Direct me.<br>
Gale,Salutations!<br>
Gale,I'm hardly pining. It's been a year or more since Mystra cast me aside.
Gale,Not just clever - rather ingenious. Somehow its construction keeps the Shadow Curse at bay.
Gale,"Unsurprising, really. Fanatical cultists tend to care more for ambience than aesthetics."
Gale,Don't get too comfortable. We shouldn't overstay our welcome in such a place.
Gale,Quite the opposite. Some monastic orders celebrated their pungency as proof of their devotion. 'To think is to stink' was the motto of one ill-fated brotherhood near Amn. 
Gale,"No mere temple. This was a monastery, devoted as much to study as to worship."
Gale,Easiest thing in the world. Though I'd do it the other way around.
Gale,Ignore him. Astarion envies the depth of our bond because he's of a shallower inclination.
Gale,Sounds like a recipe for disaster. But you know what? I'm learning to enjoy the taste of chaos. Count me in.
Gale,Uhm... Sure. In silence.
Gale,"On the nautiloid? No, this is a different nursery - similar, but not identical. There's likely one in every colony."
Gale,You had a taste for tentacles?
Gale,Nothing good can come of it unless it is contained. Why?
Gale,Cover me.<br>
Gale,Curiosity trumps combat then.<br>
Gale,Good move. Maybe.<br>
Gale,"What did you have in mind? A quiet party, toasting your return with a few good friends?"
Gale,You know what - that is not the easiest of questions for me to answer.
Gale,I tried once before... but it seems Bhaal has too tight a grasp on you.
Gale,"Still though, I won't leave. There's a good person in there somewhere."
Gale,"Yes, lovely."
Gale,"Surprise, surprise."
Gale,All the world's my stage and you're just a player in it.
Gale,"Oh, what a tangled Weave we web!"
Gale,Sembian wine; Cormyrian boar; Waterdhavian conversation. It's the little things you miss while on the road.
Gale,I hope Halaster takes good care of Tara while I'm away.
Gale,Perhaps not the best use of my time.<br>
Gale,A quick peek will have to do.<br>
Gale,Quite right. So long as the attempt won't leave us similarly dismantled...
Gale,"You two have met before, I take it?"
Gale,Are there no flowers in Tu'narath?
Gale,"I'd rather get them from my florist in Waterdeep, if it's all the same to you."
Gale,Does the Astral Sea come with an equally irritable goddess?
Gale,Many a wise man and woman indeed. Waterdeep is the home of myriad scholars. 
Gale,Congratulations. That was hard-fought and well-deserved. You're free.
Gale,"Without you, I'd likely be long dead. Count me extremely grateful you're still here."
Gale,"There is nothing more to be said, but a final goodbye."
Gale,Now?<br>
Gale,Am I? Perhaps I am. Or perhaps I need another glass of wine.
Gale,Watch my back while I take a look.<br>
Gale,Stop it - that tickles.
Gale,"No more pigeons, Tara. They have an important job to do."
Gale,Hang on - isn't this where the post house's courier pigeons roost? I don't suppose you've been eating them...
Gale,She's agreed. Just about.
Gale,"Oh. Right. Did you hear that, Tara? Erm. Stop it."
Gale,"She isn't my tressym. She's my friend. And from the looks of things, it appears she's eating pigeons."
Gale,"Enjoy yourself now, Tara. Looks like you've got yourself set up quite nicely here."
Gale,"My, is that a ring? For us? You shouldn't have."
Gale,"No, but I am going to make you very sorry if you don't stop."
Gale,"Very well. Enjoy your feast, Tara."
Gale,"Tara, I don't suppose you're responsible for the missing messenger pigeons..."
Gale,For me? You shouldn't have.
Gale,It appears my old friend Tara here has found some objects that might interest us. Care to trade?
Gale,"Tara! That can't be you, can it?"
Gale,I'd like to know if you have any other interesting objects to trade.
Gale,She says that will be all.
Gale,Have you got any other magic objects you'd be willing to part with?
Gale,"I'd offer you some of your favourite meat, but I haven't got any. Beholder jerky is surprisingly hard to come by."
Gale,More or less. But the city is still in danger.
Gale,"Up to my eyeballs in drama, deceit, and subterfuge. Nothing unusual."
Gale,"We'll catch up later, Tara - there's no time now."
Gale,A little privacy please.
Gale,"Gods, it's like trying to sleep with a mosquito in the room."
Gale,"You made me hide, don't make me come seek you."
Gale,A friendly consultation.
Gale,I can't believe I'm doing this.
Gale,What if they see me?
Gale,Your desire?
Gale,Ready and willing.
Gale,At the ready.
Gale,An excellent choice!<br>
Gale,"Charmed, I'm sure.<br>"
Gale,Let me work my magic.<br>
Gale,"No rest for the wicked, I see.<br>"
Gale,"Time to move along, Tara. If you get caught here, you'll be in trouble."
Gale,"Enjoy your feast, Tara."
Gale,"There's a much better aviary across town, if you've already picked over the choice cuts here."
Gale,"I am. Stop that, Tara! You need to leave the pigeons be."
Gale,Let's hope there's smokepowder inside.<br>
Gale,Knight to king five.
Gale,"You're an alluring figure, Raphael. I confess, I took a liking to you the moment we met."
Gale,"So, it's time for me to return to the heavens."
Gale,"I'm very curious to know what you've been up to these past months, but I suspect the telling of that tale would keep you tied to me all evening."
Gale,It will give us plenty of time to catch up on your adventures.
Gale,"Say no more. There's a wizard in Blackstaff's anatomical department who owes me a favour, no questions asked. All diets will be catered for. I can hardly wait."
Gale,"Still, at the very least you must come visit me. I've a pantry full of Waterdhavian delicacies and a delightful bottle of Elverquisst with your name on them..."
Gale,"I totally understand. Perhaps our exploits might be a little on the mature side for my students, come to think of it..."
Gale,Of course you'll be most welcome to stay with me in my tower.
Gale,Of course you'll be most welcome to stay with me in my tower-
Gale,"So, in the spirit of selflessness I encourage you to mix and mingle for now. We've time enough to come."
Gale,Excellent. I knew you wouldn't be able to resist the allure of sharing your expertise.
Gale,"I've told my students plenty of tales about our escapades. You're something of a hero to them, you know."
Gale,And I couldn't be happier for you. A fitting reward for the sacrifices you made in getting here.
Gale,Quiet is not always peace - that much I can vouch for. But in your case - I think you deserve a moment's rest.
Gale,And what of you? What are you making of this new-found lease of life we earned?
Gale,I can hardly leave it to the likes of Volo to give a true account of our adventures. And no one would believe him if he did.
Gale,"In fact, I've actually been considering writing down the story of our adventures. The true tale of our flawed but ultimately endearing troupe, and the trials and tribulations we overcame."
Gale,"I did. But meeting you, travelling that strangest of roads together, I learned to see myself differently. See the Weave differently."
Gale,"I'd be delighted to introduce you to my current cohort - as a guest lecturer, perhaps? I'm sure they'd have plenty of questions for you."
Gale,"I confess, sometimes while marking a student's fifth attempt at explaining the principles of illusory materialization, the thought occurs to me..."
Gale,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. I can hardly wait."
Gale,Please - enjoy the rest of your evening.
Gale,Consider it done.
Gale,"Quite cruelly, too. "
Gale,Might as well.
Gale,Not a problem.
Gale,Easy enough.
Gale,Let's give this a try.
Gale,Go on - excel.
Gale,"Oh. Well, no matter. Dinner alone can be every bit as enjoyable as with company."
Gale,A token of my appreciation.
Gale,Make me proud.
Gale,Hand in hand.
Gale,My best is yours.
Gale,Let's tip the scales.
Gale,"Perhaps I might come to you, then? I recently met the most excellent diabolist who should be able to lend a hand with the travel arrangements..."
Gale,"No. The Blackstaff would never allow it. Health and safety, you see - it's all the rage in wizardry these days."
Gale,"I suppose, if I were to open a contained portal in a particularly safe region of Avernus..."
Gale,Together as one.
Gale,"Unfortunately, in that respect some of my apprentices seem to be rather lazy."
Gale,"Had you the decades to spare, I think you'd prove quite adept at it, as you did in that first lesson I taught you."
Gale,"Of course, I need not sell you on the virtues of such spellcasting. It lies well within your field of expertise, as you demonstrated to me."
Gale,And of course you look resplendent in it. Positively glowing... though that may be your infernal engine making itself known.
Gale,Ignore me - I'm merely overwhelmed to feel Faerunian soil beneath my boots once more. To breathe air unsullied by the noxious breath of a pursuing cambion.
Gale,"I suppose we do have a certain singed sophistication to us, though I fear the fact we stink like rotten eggs shatters the illusion somewhat."
Gale,"You're certain we shouldn't have, you know, dressed up a bit?"
Gale,"Goodness me. Well this is a rather pleasant change of pace, isn't it?"
Gale,"Well, I didn't want you showing up with an ink-stained professor on your arm. Not in such esteemed company."
Gale,"Some of us need to do rather more than oil our tentacles before a public outing, my dear."
Gale,I was hoping I'd see you here.
Gale,"The chance to see life through your eyes, as well as my own - it's been everything I hoped it would be."
Gale,"Oh, I don't know. There's a certain charm to the place, if you squint hard enough. And try not to breathe in."
Gale,"I won't deny, our living arrangements have taken some getting used to. Though you remain a ray of metaphorical sunshine amidst the darkness, as ever."
Gale,"Well, you know me. I'm always open to trying new things."
Gale,"Not me, of course. Gale of Waterdeep might have craved such attention, but Gale Dekarios does a heroic deed purely for its own quiet satisfaction. And the occasional hearty 'thank you.'"
Gale,"Well, our love can hardly be confined to expression in the common tongue. Not when githyanki offers so many colourful alternatives."
Gale,"Now, you protest, but I'm certain I saw you lingering over a first edition of 'The Plane-Shifting Pit-Fiend.' A pity it was so flammable..."
Gale,Just because we live in the Underdark doesn't mean we can't illuminate our days with the burning glow of knowledge. 
Gale,"And they are overjoyed to see you, I'm quite certain."
Gale,"Well well, look what the tressym dragged in..."
Gale,"Professor Gale Dekarios of Blackstaff Academy, educator of the esteemed School of Illusion. A pleasure to remake your acquaintance."
Gale,"She did not, I'm delighted to report."
Gale,"A pity we can't repeat it now - I'm quite certain you'd pass with flying colours. If nothing else, you'd give it more enthusiasm than some of my current apprentices."
Gale,"It was at that moment, the Weave connecting us, that I realised how much your friendship had come to mean to me. As it still does."
Gale,"It was quite something to share such a moment with you, though it vanished all too quickly."
Gale,"They try their best, of course - when they can manage to stay awake."
Gale,'Teaching' you was hardly an effort at all. Not like my present cohort of apprentices.
Gale,"You were, of course, indulging me in submitting to such a lesson. 'Teaching' you was hardly an effort at all. Not like my present cohort of apprentices."
Gale,"As I recall, you had a very... active imagination, shall we say."
Gale,"Ah, so you still remember our little lesson?"
Gale,"Smiling may no longer come easy to you, but I've seen how your tentacles twitch at my jokes. Even the ones I'm not entirely certain I was trying to make..."
Gale,"Of course, it's still in there. A constant reminder of my former hubris, and a surprisingly effective means of keeping my more disobedient students in line. Perhaps a tad too effective."
Gale,"She sought me out, not long after we went our separate ways, and assured me neither she nor the orb should pose me any threat in the future."
Gale,"Of course, I haven't clarified with my students that the orb is no longer a threat. The legend of my explosive capabilities is an excellent means of controlling a classroom. Too good, if anything. "
Gale,"Even now, I struggle to put the feeling into words. It was like exhaling for the first time, after holding my breath for so very long."
Gale,"I surrendered the Crown of Karsus to her, as I told you I would. And in return, she cured me of the orb at last."
Gale,"Or the fear of Mystra, to be more specific."
Gale,"I have to say, I'm quite grateful to just be 'Gale' for the evening."
Gale,"Well, that was quite lovely. I'm glad you're as pleased to see me as I am you."
Gale,A heart-to-heart.
Gale,"I was afraid to so much as dream of a night like this. To hope that my life might amount to more than lonely, bitter disappointment. And then I found you."
Gale,Our very souls do echo.
Gale,Some pillow talk.
Gale,Right away.
Gale,That way?
Gale,Let's explore.
Gale,To new horizons.
Gale,The path less travelled.
Gale,Adventure awaits.
Gale,Most excellent.
Gale,I venture forth.
Gale,Forthwith.
Gale,I don't think this is strictly legal.
Gale,"Knock, knock."
Gale,Surely there's a spell for this sort of thing.
Gale,Give me some cover.
Gale,Steady...
Gale,This is hardly the time.
Gale,I should be concentrating on the enemy.
Gale,The right tools for the wrong trade.
Gale,"Yes, why not."
Gale,"My, my."
Gale,This will come in handy.
Gale,At once.<br>
Gale,I'll take care of that.
Gale,No obstacle too great.
Gale,A rather sticky situation.
Gale,Take me by the hand.
Gale,Let me take away the pain.
Gale,I will keep you safe.
Gale,Could be useful.
Gale,My life for yours.
Gale,Cantankerousness ahead.
Gale,Words fail me.
Gale,Ever a dull moment.
Gale,I'd rather not.
Gale,Let's get this over with.
Gale,Good find.
Gale,Mine for the taking.
Gale,"Oh, bother."
Gale,Could be interesting.
Gale,In for a surprise.
Gale,Curiosity must be satisfied.
Gale,Pearls before swine.
Gale,Aren't we precious...
Gale,There's always one...
Gale,I suppose some help is in order.
Gale,"Let's remedy that, shall we?"
Gale,"Take heart, I'm here for you."
Gale,"Hang in there, dearest."
Gale,If you insist.
Gale,Your knight in magic armour.
Gale,Like a ghost.
Gale,"My, I actually did it."
Gale,I could have struck a blow instead.
Gale,Now let's get back into the fight.
Gale,A lucky gamble.
Gale,That was close.
Gale,More than just lip service.
Gale,I won't fail you.
Gale,Let me make myself indispensable.<br>
Gale,Just go for the Magic Missile and fire away. Never fails.
Gale,Don't make me go all Edwin Odesseiron on you.
Gale,Let's have a peek inside.
Gale,Colour me curious.
Gale,Let's take a gander.
Gale,This has to be frowned upon.<br>
Gale,I perform better on my feet.<br>
Gale,Must I?<br>
Gale,"O, to cast on bended knee.<br>"
Gale,I'll keep my doubts to myself...<br>
Gale,I will be but an illusion.<br>
Gale,"An invisibility spell works too, you know.<br>"
Gale,There goes my equilibrium.<br>
Gale,The whispered Weave.<br>
Gale,A silent spell.<br>
Gale,On cat's paws.<br>
Gale,Did they see me?<br>
Gale,"Two left hands, I see."
Gale,Get. Out. Of. My. Head.
Gale,"A word, my dear."
Gale,A spot of bother.
Gale,"Before we met I fear I was rather stuck in my ways. And stuck inside my tower with a world-shattering orb of magic sealed within my chest, to be fair to myself."
Gale,"One can never have too many buttresses, after all."
Gale,Day three: hair loss and blood leaking from all orifices.
Gale,Need I go on?
Gale,Day four: excruciating pain as the skeleton and organs reform and reposition.
Gale,"Day five: the host's personality has disappeared. Fingers, toes and limbs elongate."
Gale,I take it you get the picture?
Gale,Day six: the flesh around the mouth splits to make way for tentacles.
Gale,Day seven: a mind flayer is born.
Gale,Day two: hallucinations and greying skin.
Gale,This is the abridged version of course.
Gale,"My point is this: our orifices remain blissfully unbloodied. Our heads remain clear, and our blood temperature normal."
Gale,"Our orifices remain blissfully unbloodied. Our heads remain clear, and our blood temperature normal."
Gale,Any expert will agree: this is... abnormal.
Gale,I'll toast to that.
Gale,"The pragmatic in me, however, sees only the silence before the storm."
Gale,Something to sleep on. We should get some rest.
Gale,"That, alas, is where my knowledge fails me."
Gale,The storyteller's gift.
Gale,A rogue might call it luck; a priest might call it fate.
Gale,Day one: fever and memory loss.
Gale,Ceremorphosis. What does it make you think of?
Gale,What a difference a day makes.
Gale,Now we have tadpoles slithering through our heads like carnivorous foeti.
Gale,That's not abstract.
Gale,That's the spirit. Let's be up with the lark - find a healer before the wee one gets hungry.
Gale,This ballet of flames invites reflection. But you're right.
Gale,Let's be up with the lark - find a healer before the wee one gets hungry.
Gale,"Point well-made, I see."
Gale,Spot on.
Gale,I'll wake you bright and early. We'll need to find a healer before the wee one gets hungry.
Gale,Hold your horses! I'm just poorly making a point.
Gale,*Indistinct humming.*
Gale,Be with you in a moment!
Gale,"Indulging in a spot of vanity. Handsome devil, aren't I?"
Gale,"Not a trick, my friend. Magic!"
Gale,"Whatever for? Look at him! Never too much of a good thing, I say."
Gale,Be that as it may.
Gale,Merely contemplating.
Gale,As for myself: I'm a pragmatic. I see the silence before the storm.
Gale,Study.
Gale,"But what is happening, or rather not happening to us, is entirely undocumented."
Gale,This should give me an edge.
Gale,I was raised better than this.
Gale,If I really must.
Gale,Your wish is my regret.
Gale,How rude.
Gale,"Wealth is to be shared, I suppose."
Gale,Nimble fingers; ill intent.
Gale,No advantage is unfair.
Gale,I feel apologetic already.
Gale,Let's put on a show.<br>
Gale,Give them nine hells.
Gale,Let me make myself indispensable.
Gale,Easy - and effective.<br>
Gale,Use it wisely.
Gale,An essential incantation.
Gale,I have power enough to share.
Gale,Woe upon the unsuspecting.
Gale,How opportune.
Gale,"Surprise, surprise.<br>"
Gale,"Yes, lovely.<br>"
Gale,Uncharted territory. The silence before the storm.
Gale,"What is happening, or rather not happening to us, is entirely undocumented."
Gale,"Yes, but that doesn't quite explain little old me, now does it?"
Gale,Spot on again.
Gale,A faultless if abridged version of the facts.
Gale,Can't say I blame you.
Gale,"Ah, yes. The good old days."
Gale,Long story short then:
Gale,"Thanks to the tadpole, we should have developed more than invasive symptoms by now, but we haven't."
Gale,"Not the prettiest of transmutations, is it?"
Gale,I saw Lae'zel giving you a look-over. Great minds think alike.
Gale,No doubt she came to the same conclusion: we're healthier than we should be.
Gale,A gentleman's only as dashing as his least groomed locus.
Gale,"It's done all that and more at plenty a soirée, I can tell you."
Gale,"Well, we all have secrets in one form or another. So long as his don't come back to bite us, I'm not here to judge."
Gale,"Well, we all have secrets in one form or another. So long as his don't come back to bite us, I'm not one to judge."
Gale,Deadlier than ever.
Gale,"Devils, dragons, mind flayers - they used to be abstracts. Pictures on a piece of paper."
Gale,"Our lives are certainly a far cry from the one I once pictured. Even now, with the orb's fires quelled by Mystra at last, I scarcely dare believe it."
Gale,But we've seen Hell. It's real. And it isn't trivial.
Gale,"Oh. Nothing, nothing. I'm just poorly making a point."
Gale,"I suppose you're right. Our adventures had their time and place, but it's good that we've moved forward. Carved out a life for ourselves every bit as rich and rewarding as the journey that brought us together."
Gale,"We have had some fun, haven't we?"
Gale,The perils we faced are but trifles compared to those inflicted by the shoppers of Waterdeep when there's a bargain to be had.
Gale,"I suggest we steer clear of the Trades Ward during Waukeentide, in that case."
Gale,"I'm surprised to hear you so squeamish given your, er, dietary predilections. I assume that's why you eat with your eyes closed."
Gale,"Enjoy yourself, my love. I'll be right here if you need me. Or else somewhere near the buffet..."
Gale,"Now go on, before I change my mind."
Gale,"I could never forget about you, Tara. You wouldn't let me."
Gale,I love you.
Gale,"Now, much as I could spend an eternity in your company - we see plenty of each other already."
Gale,"And so long as I continue my studies on the finer points of infernal engineering, who knows - we might make a home in Waterdeep yet."
Gale,"And with both Tara and I hard at work studying the finer points of devilish engineering, who knows - we might make a home in Waterdeep yet."
Gale,"No, fear not - I've no burning desire to return to this plane. Strange as it is to say, I'm feeling rather at home in Avernus."
Gale,Quite right. And we're delighted every time the catflap of displacement brings you to us.
Gale,Without you? Not a tressym in Hell's chance.
Gale,"Gods knows, we suffered for our salvation, but it was worth it, wasn't it?"
Gale,"Tempting as it is to keep you all to myself, we'd be terrible company if we didn't mingle for at least part of the evening."
Gale,As I told you long ago - it is to be avoided.
Gale,I'm not sure I'll ever get over my good fortune in that respect. You are the happiness I never dreamed I could deserve.
Gale,"We've tales enough to fill a good few volumes, and when the truth runs out, who knows... My quill might take us on further adventures yet."
Gale,"Aha! But only in the pursuit of other pleasures besides the study of magic. Writing, painting, a spot of knitting... I've never been so relaxed."
Gale,I don't know where to begin in telling people what we've been up to. I suspect they won't believe me...
Gale,"Oh, ignore me - I'm perfectly content. Besides, the chance to step out for a night on your arm is hardly one I'm going to pass up."
Gale,'Home.' How I love to share that word with you.
Gale,Come now - our adventures have offered far more than the potential for destruction. I have enough looted literature to fill a dozen libraries.
Gale,"I merely lacked the correct motivation, but even the City of Splendours itself fails to dazzle when set against your beauty."
Gale,"I'm delighted to be here amongst friends again, but part of me is reluctant to step away from our new life - even for such a gathering as this."
Gale,I have been dabbling with the idea of capturing our adventures with humble ink and parchment.
Gale,"The chance to see life through your good eye, as well as my own - it's been everything I hoped it would be."
Gale,"I confess, when I left Waterdeep there was a part of me afraid that I might regret my decision. But I never have."
Gale,"Not a sentiment I can entirely relate to, but a fresh start is always good for the spirit."
Gale,"Protective as ever, but fear not - my ambition now stretches only as far as getting my marking done in time for us to share a glass of zzar in the Yawning Portal."
Gale,"When Mystra quelled the orb at last, she did more than rid me of its threat. She created room for hope, where once I felt only despair."
Gale,"Speaking of which, I think it's high time you blessed someone other than myself with your inimitable presence."
Gale,You feign indifference but I can see it in your eye. You're as delighted to be amongst this company as I am.
Gale,And I'm quite certain they're as delighted to see you as you are to see them.
Gale,"I know our time together is rather snatched, but I assure you - it's also savoured. You remain very precious to me, as does everyone."
Gale,"Standing here now I no longer see the people we were - frightened, desperate, alone. We changed. We survived. And we did it together."
Gale,"When our adventure began, our troupe had no more in common than the worm in our brains."
Gale,"I'm just glad you're happy there. When we met, our lives were rather different, and being here this evening... well, it reminds me how much has changed."
Gale,"In that case, I'd highly recommend taking the time to expand your social horizons. You can do better than a worm for company, I promise you."
Gale,It's good to see you again.
Gale,Excellent. I'll have my sturdiest magical boots at the ready.
Gale,"You were quite the travelling companion, my friend. I know our paths diverge from here, but should you ever desire a wizard to walk at your side - you know where to find me. "
Gale,"Of all the outcomes I might have expected from our journey, I confess - finding love wasn't one of them. But it so often lurks in the most unexpected of places."
Gale,As am I. What a relief it was to set that particular burden down at last.
Gale,"It's strange to say it, but I've never been happier. This unexpected life of mine has turned out to be quite wonderful."
Gale,And I'm glad you've found a love of your own. We both deserve that.
Gale,"I must say, you're looking very well. I'd hazard a guess that  life without a tadpole in your skull is rather suiting you."
Gale,"Go, have fun. I promise I'll stay out of trouble for one evening."
Gale,"I know my charm is intoxicating, but let's not be poor company."
Gale,"Your optimism is inspirational as always, but I think convincing the general population to place their fates in the hands of a devil - however well meaning - might prove challenging."
Gale,"You'll have to more to earn the people's trust than be your father's son. But I know you to be a duke worthy of the title - they will see it too, in time."
Gale,"Careful now - you sound more a despot than a duke. If this is truly the authority you seek, you must wield it justly."
Gale,Go to Hell.
Gale,Hah. You're a good sport.
Gale,I can't believe this is real. I never thought we'd gather like this again.
Gale,"Marvellous party, isn't it?"
Gale,It turns out rather a lot of my clothes are a bit bloodstained. Can't think why...
Gale,"You'd think I'd be used to dressing up, with all the pageantry life at your side has thrust upon me..."
Gale,"As my mother always says, 'if you can't find yourself in Waterdeep, you're not looking in the right mirror.'"
Gale,You've certainly exposed me to sides of Waterdeep I'd never had the pleasure of experiencing until now. If 'pleasure' is the word for such places...
Gale,"An impression I'm delighted the city has managed to redeem. As have I, I hope."
Gale,"You've certainly made quite the impression on my friends down at the Yawning Portal. The last I heard, they were thinking of naming a drink after you."
Gale,That you do. I've not had so much fun in Waterdeep since my own days as a wayward Blackstaff apprentice.
Gale,"Even my own city feels new to me, now that I share it with you."
Gale,Just one of the myriad unexpected ways life has delighted me in recent months.
Gale,Teaching at Blackstaff Academy has proven such an unexpected pleasure. Sometimes I find it hard to tear myself away.
Gale,"I won't keep you to myself for too long, but while I have you - I want to say thank you for encouraging me to attend this evening."
Gale,"The day I shave this beard, Tara, is that day I shave you. For both of our sakes, I hope it never comes."
Gale,"That's a relief. I wasn't sure if I'd made too much of an effort. Or perhaps, not enough..."
Gale,I can't remember when I last wore something other than my teaching robes. It feels a little odd to find myself in something so unsinged.
Gale,"I'm sorry to hear things have been so difficult. You have my sympathy, but not my pity. If anyone can do what needs doing, it's you - and your paramour."
Gale,"I'm sorry to hear things have been so difficult. You have my sympathy, but not my pity. If anyone can do what needs doing, it's you."
Gale,"Well! Sounds like you've been keeping yourself very busy indeed - and in good company, too. It was never like you to lay about, so I shouldn't be surprised."
Gale,"Well! Sounds like you've been keeping yourself very busy indeed. It was never like you to lay about, so I shouldn't be surprised."
Gale,"Our adventures rarely lend themselves to luxury. Or cleanliness, for that matter. It's been some time since I've made such an effort..."
Gale,'Go to Hell.' An everyday expression. So trivial it's almost meaningless.
Gale,Good show.
Gale,With diligence and care.
Gale,Such a long way down.
Gale,"You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds."
Gale,"Sometimes. But I imposed it upon myself, after all. I set up enough wards to keep an army at bay, never mind the few colleagues who sought to inquire about my welfare."
Gale,"One respects life by fighting for it, and one respects death by fearing it."
Gale,"Believe it or not, but I witnessed a similar standoff back at the Yawning Portal."
Gale,"Of course, an establishment like that invites all sorts of outlandish entertainments."
Gale,An inn in Waterdeep. Never a dull moment there. Adventurers come from all over Faerûn to try their luck down the well:
Gale,"Leads into the Undermountain, you see - full of death, danger, and vast amounts of treasure. Hard to resist."
Gale,Please - feel free to enjoy yourself elsewhere. No doubt there are others here who offer more welcome company.
Gale,"Oh, a drow, a dragonborn, and a cleric of Cyric walk into a bar. Your standard fare."
Gale,"In any case, out came the crossbow, and a hush fell over the entire room."
Gale,I stood up and yelled: 'Shadowdark ale for everyone!'
Gale,"The crowd cheered, the tension drained into five dozen tankards, and soon all was well again."
Gale,"In a place like the Yawning Portal, the most powerful magic is calling for a round of drinks."
Gale,"Mind you, all I did was call for ale, but you went and stood in front of that crossbow."
Gale,"Mind you, all I did was call for ale, but one of ours went and stood in front of that crossbow."
Gale,I'd drink to that.
Gale,"Maybe someone was cheating at cards, maybe it was some weird lovers' quarrel."
Gale,"No, no, no. Yours truly defused the situation."
Gale,"I hope, though we've only known each other for a short time, I might be able to count you among that number?"
Gale,"Sadly not. If I'm being entirely honest, my social circle is rather small. More of a dot. Or a pinhead."
Gale,"Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time."
Gale,"Wine is to wit as meat is to... to... oh, I can't bloody remember it. There I go, then, proving your point."
Gale,Perhaps we'd better leave it at that. My ineloquent tongue isn't worthy of your ear at present.
Gale,"With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak."
Gale,"Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning."
Gale,"Go, indulge in the frivolities - they're good for the heart. And mine will be all the lighter, to see you enjoying yourself."
Gale,"Always bringing such candour to our conversations. Some would think twice about mocking Gale of Waterdeep, but you just go straight for the gut."
Gale,"I've got aquaintances, certainly. Plenty of colleagues. But friends? Those are precious indeed."
Gale,"I like that about you. It's one of your rarer qualities, though I fear my ego can take no more of it tonight."
Gale,Consider this budding romance thoroughly nipped. Though I hope our friendship need not come to such an abrupt end.
Gale,"The pleasures I experienced in Mystra's embrace go far beyond the thrill of having one's tummy tickled. I remember once, she took the smallest piece of the Weave and made it into - "
Gale,Wait. Are you saying...
Gale,"I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now."
Gale,"You know what, I think I've clearly had far too much wine. And you've had nowhere near enough. I think this is a conversation best held back on - for now."
Gale,"Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose."
Gale,"Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful."
Gale,Right. Understood. You shall hear no more on the subject from me.
Gale,Suit yourself. I was merely going to remark that you handled yourself pretty well.
Gale,Suit yourself. I was merely going to remark that we handled ourselves pretty well.
Gale,"That woman has more venom in her heart than a snake in its fangs, but at least the child is safe."
Gale,I like the sound of that.
Gale,"Just because we do not like the alternative, does not mean we are not free to choose our course."
Gale,He is the prince of a people who've spent aeons nursing a hatred of the very creature nestled in our skulls.
Gale,"Save him, and who's to say he wouldn't run us through at the first opportunity?"
Gale,"To cure me of the orb, yes. But what of the guilt of allowing one of my friends to sacrifice their very soul and become illithid?"
Gale,"Or worse, trusting a mind flayer to wield the stones, and giving it the chance to dominate a Netherbrain? "
Gale,"Barely woken from his slumber, and already the prince of the githyanki demands one of us surrender our souls in service of him."
Gale,"Very well. We'll do this the old fashioned way then - swords, spells and sweat. Adventurers to the end - whatever form it may take."
Gale,"Tara did her best to keep my spirits up, of course, but there's only so much one tressym can make up for one's entire social circle. And she was often gone seeking items to treat my condition."
Gale,"You're the first person I've spent any significant time with in a year or more. Spending time in your company, I realise that I may have left behind the greater part of my wit, and sensitivity, in my tower."
Gale,Make the best decision you can - that's all anyone could ask of you. I will stand by your side regardless.
Gale,"No doubt, in the context of aeons of torture, it seems a small ask. But, of course, he does not realise what else we might have to offer."
Gale,"I'll be straight with you, If I am to have any chance of getting my hands on that crown then my best my best option is to take the stones and transform."
Gale,"It's a big risk, I'm well aware, but it's even a greater risk to lose that crown if anything were to happen."
Gale,"It's not ideal, but the way I see it we kill two birds with one stone. You get to keep your teeth, and I get some assurance in acquiring the crown."
Gale,"I know Karlach has the best intentions, but her kind heart is not going to help me get that crown. Let me do this."
Gale,That thing looks set to kill her!
Gale,"Regardless, my offer stands. Should you change your mind, I will not let you down."
Gale,Please - at least consider my offer.
Gale,Entirely.
Gale,What is youth if not a time to be forgiven for one's transgressions?
Gale,"Couldn't agree more. The girl wasn't innocent, but that doesn't mean she was guilty."
Gale,"Come, let's cut the kid some slack, shall we? She didn't deserve this madcap spectacle as far as I'm concerned."
Gale,Ha! And you don't? You're wholly without vice or sin or the occasional lapse in judgement?
Gale,No - you don't strike me as quite that boring.
Gale,If it did - perhaps it would understand the weight of what it's asking of us. And why we might seek an alternative.
Gale,The thought must have crossed your mind? It has certainly weighed on mine. 
Gale,"I know, we've been through this before. But our situation has changed since then, and not for the better. "
Gale,I think it's time we reconsider the orb. 
Gale,"With its power, I could put an end to this whole thing - Crown, Netherbrain, Absolute. Everything. "
Gale,"If I'm destined to die, I can think of worse ways. At least if I use the orb, I can ensure the brain dies with me. "
Gale,In a word - yes.
Gale,"The real question is, do you trust me?"
Gale,Do not mistake me - I want to live. But I've been careless enough with my life in the past. I can hardly stand by and watch you sacrifice yours.
Gale,"Once I'm in position, I will ensure you are removed to a safe vantage point to watch the fireworks. You need not die alongside me. Nor surrender your soul in becoming an illithid."
Gale,"Then I will hold my peace. But if the time comes when even her sacrifice is not enough, call on me, and I will be ready."
Gale,"If you think it's best, but I hope you're confident in your powers of persuasion. The last thing we need is another enemy to contend with."
Gale,I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.
Gale,"We have a world to save, and I'm the only one here to have something to gain from the transformation."
Gale,Then let me say it more plainly -
Gale,"Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise."
Gale,An all-too-familiar tale. I refuse to believe we cannot alter the ending.
Gale,"As for myself, I could quite do with a tumbler full of Waterdeep Whiskey."
Gale,Anyway. We live. For the moment.
Gale,How about we go find that chap Halsin little miss Poison Ivy mentioned? With a bit of luck he has the means to offer us a cure rather than a coffin.
Gale,"I know. I know you are. And yet... A few moments more, a few different words spoken..."
Gale,"I know. I know we are. And yet... a few moments more, a few different words spoken..."
Gale,"It's not right to feel the cold breath of death in your neck, then move on as if it was nothing but a soothing breeze."
Gale,Indeed?
Gale,"This is Elminster Aumar, the most famed and respected wizard in the realms!"
Gale,"Meet Elminster Aumar. A good friend of mine, but rather more significantly, he's the most famed and respected wizard in the realms."
Gale,There go our best supplies.
Gale,A wise choice. Better to indulge our curiosity than Elminster's appetite.
Gale,"Nigh on thirteen centuries old and he still thinks with his stomach. We'd best follow, and see if he's more disposed to speak plainly once it's stopped its grumbling."
Gale,"Oh, for the love of..."
Gale,"But why? Out with it, Elminster. Please!"
Gale,"Yes, yes, yes, be that as it may, you said you came all this way on my behalf, did you not? For what purpose?"
Gale,Originally? Shadowdale. Lately? The fanciest inns of Waterdeep.
Gale,I'm not feeling all that indulgent just now.
Gale,"But it was handled, and it was handled well."
Gale,"Yes. Yes, I am. It's just that, had it been me... Had it been..."
Gale,"Not to be overly pedantic, but they are my powers now."
Gale,I don't recall saying that I'd given up.
Gale,"You're not content to fade into the history books just yet. In time, you'll come to see that."
Gale,"You see? Now you're realising your true potential. You, and many more by the day."
Gale,"Regardless, ethical quandaries are more the remit of my mortal devotees. They do love to talk, and Faerûn is starting to listen."
Gale,"What a twist, to have spent so long thwarting the ambitions of the Illithid Empire, only for me to assist you, a rogue mind flayer, in pursuing yours."
Gale,"I'm sure he'll come around, in a millennium or so, and by then my creed will be something to reckon with."
Gale,"But you handled it, and you handled it well!"
Gale,Ao would prefer to let the cosmic dust settle from my unexpected ascension before considering my right to grant my followers such power.
Gale,"Pursue your dreams, and keep me in your prayers, and who knows... they might just get answered."
Gale,"I can't believe she wanted to poison us, that she tried to put us down like dying dogs without as much as a whisper of consent!"
Gale,"I can't believe she poisoned you, tried to put you down like a dying dog without as much as a whisper of consent!"
Gale,Right? She had no right!
Gale,"Yes - against her will, without rhyme or reason!"
Gale,A taste of her own medicine is what she deserves!
Gale,How dare she snuff out life with as much thought as snuffing out a bloody candle?<br>
Gale,"Don't worry. With the ambition you hold, you'll never be too far from my sights."
Gale,Say nothing.
Gale,Spare me the chagrin - I didn't ask for you to track me down.
Gale,"Well, boots are made for walking. I believe a bard once said something similar."
Gale,"After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy."
Gale,"I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life."
Gale,"After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve."
Gale,"'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs."
Gale,You remind me of her somewhat. The same sharp tongue. And sharp teeth.
Gale,You remind me of her somewhat. You share her pragmatic streak.
Gale,You remind me of her somewhat. You share a certain nobility of spirit.
Gale,"She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently."
Gale,"You remind me of her somewhat. You share her fierceness, and her passion."
Gale,"You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw..."
Gale,"I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home."
Gale,"Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope."
Gale,"Very funny. But as we all know, nymphs are sticklers when it comes to their bathing routines. You, my friend, haven't been near a fresh spring in a tenday or more."
Gale,Not that I don't appreciate your musk. I actually rather like it...
Gale,"Well, this seems as good a time as any for me to stop babbling on."
Gale,"I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further."
Gale,You remind me of her somewhat. Something in the way you roll your eyes when I speak...
Gale,"I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me."
Gale,Not everyone is comfortable being alone with their thoughts. Though I never felt alone with a book in my hand. Or with her for company.
Gale,"She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight..."
Gale,"Don't keep me in suspense, Elminster."
Gale,Head to my camp yourself. I'll join when I can.
Gale,"All right, let's go."
Gale,Mystra? What does she want of me?
Gale,My sympathies for your wearied soles. Care to explain what you're doing?
Gale,Elminster?
Gale,You're all too quick to abandon the one you promised yourself to. That is not a quality I admire.
Gale,"I'm glad you feel the same way. But, while I'm eager to enjoy your company on an exclusive basis later this evening, it would be selfish to keep you to myself before then. "
Gale,"So please - go, and enjoy the festivities. Anticipation will only make our reunion the sweeter."
Gale,There's something... unspeakable about Shadowheart. But I mean that in a good way. She seems to me like a bud on the cusp of bursting into a rose.
Gale,That or deadly nightshade.
Gale,Wyll's a good man. He may actually be a tried-and-true storybook hero.
Gale,Then again he's so full of himself it's a small miracle he hasn't resorted to self-cannibalism yet.
Gale,I'm glad you sought me out. Amid all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening.
Gale,"Come now! This is a night for celebration, not suspicion."
Gale,"A beautiful night, don't you think? Nothing like a brush with destruction to make one appreciate the majesty of the celestial canvas."
Gale,It's a view I would once have shared with my companion. Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry.
Gale,"I assure you, when I tell someone they're wonderful - I mean it. And you are wonderful."
Gale,"You convinced me how important it is, and nothing important is ever easy."
Gale,"So keep your face looking pretty as it should, and let me take this one for the team."
Gale,You won't regret it.
Gale,Curiosity is a trait we all share.
Gale,I was given powerful magic to consume when I needed it most.
Gale,It would...
Gale,"Actually, on second thought I can't think of it entailing anything particularly enticing at all."
Gale,"Forgive me, I seem to be of two minds and two moods. We'll blame the wine and leave it at that."
Gale,"We shared a romantic moment of the mind while cloaked in the Weave, didn't we?"
Gale,And I seem to recall a fond allusion to that moment afterwards.
Gale,"You just let me know which hill of burning sulphur to aim for, and I'll have popped through a portal before you can say 'Zariel'."
Gale,Perhaps that's a moment we ought to further explore.
Gale,Tonight seems perfectly suited for such endeavours.
Gale,Allow me to make the following proposition:
Gale,"There's a book that circulates in Amn, detailing the first thousand nights of a newlywed king and queen."
Gale,"They turned everything they did into an art. The art of conversation. The art of taste, time honoured and newly acquired."
Gale,The art of the body. The exploration and acceptance of the self and the other. The art of the night itself.
Gale,I say we take a page from their book.
Gale,"Forget the book then. Let's be blank slates on blank sheets, delightfully new."
Gale,"We had a moment, you and I, a moment in which we expressed the possibility of becoming more than friends."
Gale,"I'm many things, but coy's not one of them."
Gale,I don't see why not - two heads are better than one. Unless you're dealing with an ettin...
Gale,"Well, I for one can't wait. And I say with some confidence - neither can they."
Gale,"Psst! Shoo, Tara."
Gale,I feel quite certain that the bond of friendship between us will have far more longevity.
Gale,I can only hope my tale will live up to your expectations.
Gale,"Tonight, of course, we celebrate, and I won't keep you any longer. Tomorrow night though, you're in for quite the bedtime story."
Gale,"She's gone... and Wyll's been consigned to the Hells along with her. Farewell, Blade."
Gale,Six months is a trifle - you'd barely read through a single bookcase in Candlekeep in such a time.
Gale,"I assure you, I meant exactly what I said to you at the time. Perfect as they are, some things aren't made to last forever."
Gale,Never fear. My students are as open-minded and generous a bunch as you'll find north of the Chionthar. And I'll remind them of their manners.
Gale,"Fear not. My heart has survived far crueller partings, and lived to tell the tale."
Gale,"Living life to the full, even as an illithid. Inspirational stuff."
Gale,"Well, I for one can't think of anyone better equipped to survive the endless wrath of an all-powerful deity with an empire of violent and morally dubious astral warriors at her disposal."
Gale,"No harm keeping yourself busy. You've a reputation to maintain, after all."
Gale,"Gotcha, gotcha. Your secrets are safe with me..."
Gale,Sounds delightful. What a joy it must be to live so freely in the light at last.
Gale,"Impressive. I'm afraid news of your church's success hasn't yet reached my ears in Waterdeep, but where Shar's concerned, I suppose secrecy is rather the point."
Gale,"Still keeping those teeth sharp, I'll wager."
Gale,"From you, I'd expect nothing less."
Gale,Then we'll start writing the prequel.
Gale,What do you say?
Gale,That's because I'm full of delights.
Gale,"I'm a wizard, not a cat burglar."
Gale,Such an undignified position to find oneself in.<br>
Gale,My knees are starting to ache.
Gale,This really isn't my forte.
Gale,Easy - and effective.
Gale,This should do you some good.
Gale,It will be my pleasure.
Gale,I'd rather stand tall.<br>
Gale,No honour among sneaks.
Gale,"Oh, bother.<br>"
Gale,You've got the wrong man for this.<br>
Gale,Not this again.<br>
Gale,Unseen and unsightly.
Gale,My robes will get dirty.
Gale,It's a gnome's life for me.
Gale,The coward's route.
Gale,Brought low.<br>
Gale,What?<br>
Gale,"Get me up, would you?<br>"
Gale,Intolerable.<br>
Gale,"We'll let the night run its course. And when everything is quieting down, safe in the arms of sleep, I'll come by to find safety in yours."
Gale,That's because you've yet to find out what you're missing.
Gale,Doubt is a spoilsport. Cast it aside.
Gale,"A match made... not quite in heaven, but close enough."
Gale,Merely to share a glass of wine I suppose; to toast to victory and to offer you an invitation.
Gale,"No, I was glad you sought me out for an entirely different reason:"
Gale,"I'm sorry, but surely we're friends, allies, the best of companions, but... no more than that."
Gale,"No, I was glad you sought me out for an entirely different reason: to toast to victory and to offer you an invitation."
Gale,One with the Weave.
Gale,I'm surprised you spotted me.
Gale,"Bad for one's back, this."
Gale,How much longer will this take?<br>
Gale,How unseemly.<br>
Gale,Just hurry this along.<br>
Gale,Why am I doing this?<br>
Gale,I can't see a thing from down here.<br>
Gale,This is no fun at all.<br>
Gale,I think it makes perfect sense.
Gale,Who better to warn of the perils of misusing magic than someone who was once only a wayward sneeze away from destroying a mid-sized settlement?
Gale,The time has come to paint you the true picture.
Gale,"You know of my condition and its challenges, but those are but the broad strokes."
Gale,"You may not wish to enter the heavens, but you do a fine job conjuring them here."
Gale,"If I cannot spend an eternity with you, I'll settle for an evening."
Gale,"I'm sorry, but no. I know what comes of love between the gods and mortals. I would never expose you to such risk."
Gale,"All in good time, my love. For now, mortality has one more night of enjoyment in store."
Gale,I see you won't be claiming the domain of 'patience' in the heavens.
Gale,This is only the beginning.
Gale,I am ambition incarnate. As indistinguishable from that most potent sensation as Mystra herself is from the Weave. And word is spreading.
Gale,"I've found many delights in the heavens so far, but I have to say - nothing as rare as your friendship. It's a fine thing indeed."
Gale,"At best, those concerned with the consequences of their actions might consult with Savras, god of divination. Though these days, I doubt he'd see them coming."
Gale,Hardly. I'm simply more honest about my involvement. Not to say I don't help more actively when the cause arises.
Gale,"I can say this much - for now, Mystra is welcome to her dominion. My aims are set a little higher than offering cursory blessings to just any half-decent spellcaster."
Gale,"I confess, I expected Raphael to come knocking with that infernal contract we signed, but strangely enough he never showed his face. Intimidated, no doubt."
Gale,"Fear not. I'm treading carefully - if you think mortal politics is bad, I assure you - the machinations of the heavens would leave you reeling. "
Gale,"I assure you, this is merely the prelude to a far grander vision. Elysium's in for something of a shake-up."
Gale,"Secure at the heart of my domain, protected by all the powers at my disposal. "
Gale,"Ambition is about beginnings. It is not just about the heights, but the lows that preceded them."
Gale,A whisper in the ear of a struggling artisan. A breeze to flutter the pages of a tome before a frustrated mage. A magical weapon stumbled upon by a desperate would-be hero.
Gale,I thought you would be.
Gale,"Now, divine as my company undoubtedly is, I've an eternity to catch up with you - a luxury few others at this party possess."
Gale,"Don't let me deprive them of your company. Or mine, for that matter."
Gale,Let's go save the world.
Gale,"You know what's best. I can't say I'm not saddened, but we wouldn't have gotten this far without you."
Gale,"And who knows, maybe being a mind flayer won't be so bad."
Gale,"After everything and you still trust it. You may see something I don't, but that does not mean you see it none the less."
Gale,"We do, though were not very nice to his friends the last time we were here."
Gale,"But till the pin drops, there is always oppertunity for change. Keep me in mind, whichever choice you make."
Gale,"The two are not mutually exclusive. If someone has to change, it would be a shame to place that burden on you for me to swoop in take the reward."
Gale,This also keeps you out of harms way. If I keep listing the benifits I'll run out of birds to kill with my one stone.
Gale,"When we speak of our 'best' option, we're not choosing between caviar and foie gras."
Gale,"All our options are not great, but that doesn't mean we should consider these choices with any less gravitas."
Gale,And renounce your own god? I'm flattered.
Gale,And renounce Mystra? I didn't think you had it in you.
Gale,I suppose it was foolish to expect a mortal to understand.
Gale,I believed in you for so much of our journey. It's a pity you won't do me the same courtesy.
Gale,"I came here to offer you the heavens, but I see now such an offer would be wasted. I suppose it was foolish to expect a mortal to understand."
Gale,He's the god he deserves to be.
Gale,It's not every day a new-born god shows up to the reunion.
Gale,"Those drawn to the Galerian creed don't merely seek my guidance as the impressive, all-powerful being I've become."
Gale,"Rarer still among immortals, I'm afraid."
Gale,"Great as the heights I've reached thus far may be, I've not forgotten my humble origins. In fact, they're central to my doctrine."
Gale,"As expected, Mystra was unwilling to hand over the reins of the Weave, so I've claimed dominion over another area with which I've passing familiarity: ambition."
Gale,Goodness. Was Faerûn always so... dull?
Gale,"Resist for now, enjoy the night, and I promise - we'll be together soon enough."
Gale,You're finding it hard to stay away from me. Perfectly understandable - divine essence has a rather magnetic quality where mortals are concerned.
Gale,"However, the Blackstaff insisted I couldn't teach every subject, nor could the simulacra of myself I offered to create for that purpose."
Gale,"I did offer, as a matter of fact."
Gale,I thought you might say that.
Gale,Your formerly-murderous presence might even be enough to lighten the moods of my own students.
Gale,"Still, at least the company was worth the trip, if not the view."
Gale,"Given that's something we have in common, I'd be delighted to put in a good word for you at the Academy."
Gale,"I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to make merry, just the two of us."
Gale,Good sense will have to wait 'til the morrow.
Gale,But before you go...
Gale,"I know there are many things about me that remain shrouded in mystery. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate that."
Gale,You've given me powerful magic to consume when I needed it most.
Gale,You've brought me back from the grey shores of death.
Gale,"You know of my condition, and you know about my unfortunate efforts to win Mystra's favour, but those are but the broad strokes."
Gale,I thank you for seeking me out. Amidst all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening.
Gale,"It's quite something, isn't it, to be in the presence of the divine."
Gale,Fear not - that tingling sensation is merely your body's way of alerting you to my presence. It's perfectly harmless. In small doses.
Gale,A bold decision to treat a divine being with such cold indifference.
Gale,"As you know, the orb within me was the half-formed Karsite Weave, a magic left incomplete by Karsus's self-destruction."
Gale,"I imagine you're wondering how all this came to be. The finer points of divine ascension are beyond mortal comprehension, I'm afraid, but I can provide the rudimentary sequence of events."
Gale,"I'm forgetting my audience. Etiquette amongst the gods works rather differently. They're a lot more... direct, shall we say."
Gale,"I'm afraid time works quite differently in Elysium. I didn't realise how long I'd been gone, until I received Withers' summons."
Gale,"I told you I would, didn't I?"
Gale,Forget you? Never.
Gale,"I imagine this must be quite a shock. Whatever you're feeling, do not be afraid. It's still me, just an... improved version."
Gale,I hoped I'd see you here.
Gale,"I'm glad. To know you enjoy my company is, well, it's rather wonderful actually. I'd be loathe to waste the time of someone who's become rather important to me."
Gale,"She'd be proud to see me keeping such fine company - the saviour of those poor tieflings, no less. And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently."
Gale,"She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here. I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts."
Gale,By Ahghairon's lost nose - no!
Gale,"Don't worry about me - I'm quite content to enjoy the party from here. Go, enjoy yourself."
Gale,"Even in such fraught times as these, there is peace to be found in the stillness as evening draws in."
Gale,"I used to while away many hours just like these with my companion, though in far comfier surrounds."
Gale,Don't let me drag you away. Enjoy yourself - you earned a night of revelry.
Gale,"You mortals do love to live dangerously, don't you?"
Gale,"Mortals and their jokes... I did think to bless the heavens with my own inimitable wit, but alas, most gods are rather devoid of humour."
Gale,But perhaps fate can yet be defied...
Gale,Well... could go either way. But we came this far - should at least try.
Gale,"I have worse failings, I fear. Far worse."
Gale,This will suffice as a camp - I could sleep standing up just now.
Gale,"He sacrificed his soul to save your people, Lae'zel. Surrendered his very being to prevent the Grand Design. I'd say it's a tad ungrateful to murder him for it."
Gale,"Go forth, Lae'zel, to distant realms. I will miss you dearly."
Gale,"A kinder fate than to live as one's sworn enemy, though no less a pity for it. At least in legend, the Prince of the Comet will live forever. "
Gale,"Freedom is freedom, no matter the form. I hope he finds peace with his newfound nature - it's the least he deserves."
Gale,"The depth of your commitment to your cause truly knows no bounds. For him to have survived a Netherbrain only to be ended by your hand... well, it is an end, I suppose. "
Gale,"If it wasn't for you, we'd be thralls, dead, or who knows. This is your victory.<br>"
Gale,"Not to cast any slight on you, of course. Your form rather suits you. "
Gale,You won't hear a syllable of disagreement from these lips. Thank you.<br>
Gale,Have a ponder on what your prize shall be then. I'm still a touch winded from it all...<br>
Gale,"Oh, spare me the modesty. They should erect statues to you... though they may frighten children."
Gale,I'm glad - though not envious.<br>
Gale,Apologies. A slip of the tongue from an overjoyed comrade. Not a drop of malice meant.<br>
Gale,"Not to cast any slight on you, of course. Your present form is but a sign of your gallantry."
Gale,Have you lost your wits?! You must not do this!
Gale,That orb's about to explode - and I speak from some experience. <br>
Gale,"I understand that I'm asking for a lot, but I can't tell you everything. Not yet anyway."
Gale,A mind flayer? What the blazes is going on here?
Gale,I'm afraid it doesn't quite work like that - though of course I'm immensely grateful for any assistance you provide in times of mortal peril. But I must ask more trust of you still.
Gale,"Ketheric's army. I suppose I could end them all with a bang, but my target is the Absolute itself.<br>"
Gale,Having a wizard like me around is quite the boon when facing the perils that stalk these lands. It will be far harder for me to assist you if I can barely stand upright.
Gale,Please - trust me. Your help could be the difference between life and death.
Gale,"As luck would have it, you're already primed to give me exactly what I need..."
Gale,Thank you. I see my trust in you was not misplaced!
Gale,I'm sure we won't have to look very far to find what I need: Faerûn overflows with magic-infused treasure.
Gale,"As do our packs, as a matter of fact. We've such an item already in our possession, primed for the moment the need arises."
Gale,"Do not forget - there's a card yet to come into play. The orb. If we do not want to surrender the stones, I could still use it to ensure the brain's destruction. Along with my own, of course."
Gale,I know the allure magic artefacts hold. I understand their value and their power. All this to say: I understand the sacrifice I ask of you.
Gale,I hope I can count on you.
Gale,That's a bell you can't unring. Perhaps you should reconsider.
Gale,"A fine idea. Or at least, an idea."
Gale,A mind flayer? Not the saviour I'd been hoping for.
Gale,"Oh, and as far as that tadpole trickery goes, I really do trust you'll not be so untoward again."
Gale,"You're slightly ahead of me there. As yet, my condition is stable. I've no need to consume anything."
Gale,"When the time comes, I will not hesitate to call on you or the belongings you were generous enough to offer."
Gale,But if I may be so bold: it's for a very good cause indeed.
Gale,"Valid question. If not out of the simple goodness of your heart, then perhaps your own self-interest might be sufficient motivation."
Gale,"I will, but we can't ignore the possibility that I don't make it to the brain. It won't hurt us to have a contingency."
Gale,This is not the kind of decision to make based solely on your own wisdom. We must discuss it - privately. 
Gale,"So, what comes now? A bath certainly wouldn't go amiss..."
Gale,Why should I?
Gale,The power of Karsus would be in my hands... 
Gale,"But what then? What would I do with it, once I have it? "
Gale,"Sage and timely counsel, as always. And I intend to heed it."
Gale,"A wise man learns from his mistakes, and strives not to repeat them. I shall bring the Crown to Mystra. "
Gale,"She'll cure me of my affliction, and I'll finally be free. "
Gale,And a more deserving one this time around.
Gale,"Regardless, it's the right thing to do. That's good enough for me."
Gale,"Ugh, no. Having seen what we've seen of those who chase godhood, I'm quite content with my mortality."
Gale,"I promise, you'll have your fill of divinity at my hands. And I at yours, I hope. But only in the metaphorical sense."
Gale,"If this adventure has taught me anything, it's that there are things in this world far more valuable than power. "
Gale,"You, for example. You were always wiser than me when it mattered most. "
Gale,"Besides, I've grown quite fond of this merry band of ours, and I'd quite like to see what happens to it. "
Gale,"I'm sure Mystra will summon me soon enough, but until then, I propose we celebrate our victory the mortal way - with a drink in our hands, and reckless abandon in our hearts. "
Gale,"I will never forget you - that much I promise. And if one day you feel differently, I would be honoured to have you as my Chosen."
Gale,It's not your fault - I can hardly expect you to understand. But nor will I relinquish this chance because you are unwilling to imagine a world where I succeed.
Gale,It's not your fault - I can hardly expect you to understand. But nor will I relinquish the chance of godhood for a love that would only last a mortal lifetime. I'm sorry.
Gale,"It seems that we've come to an impasse. I stand on the threshold of divine ascension, and you would try to keep me grounded. "
Gale,Please reconsider.
Gale,"Easy, Wyll. She's no devil. There's no fight to be had here."
Gale,The Crown - it's somewhere in the Chionthar.
Gale,"If I salvage the stones, I can reforge it."
Gale,"And once I have, I'll return it to Mystra. "
Gale,"With the Crown in my hands, I would be unstoppable. The Karsite Weave would be mine to command. "
Gale,I would be more than the greatest wizard who ever lived - I would be a god. 
Gale,"If that's the only way of putting an end to this gods-forsaken mess, I will not fail you."
Gale,"I understand. You are right to heed such doubts, however much sadness it brings me to leave you behind."
Gale,Mystra has dictated the terms of my potential for long enough. The Crown would grant me control of my own destiny at last.
Gale,"Think of all I could achieve, all that I could grant to those whose ambitions are restrained by Mystra's yoke. I could raise a new Netheril right here in Faerûn."
Gale,It's I who should be saying such things. Do not think I leave you without a heart as heavy as your own. But I owe it to myself to follow where destiny leads.
Gale,"I will never forget you - that I promise. And if you ever feel differently, there will be a place waiting for you in the heavens."
Gale,"That day cannot come soon enough. But first, I must retrieve the Crown. "
Gale,"Have patience a while and I will return to you, carrying immortality in one hand and offering you ascension with the other. I will be a god, as will you. "
Gale,And I thought you wise enough to recognise that I am not the man I once was. 
Gale,"Want, need, deserve... Choose whatever word you prefer, but it is what I'm going to do."
Gale,"Gods, what living nightmare is this?"
Gale,Splendid. A bit of boldness will serve us well.
Gale,"A dead tiefling. Arabella's mother, no doubt. The horror of her end I daren't contemplate."
Gale,The way we defused the tension between Zevlor and Aradin.
Gale,The way you stood in front of a crossbow to prevent a murder.
Gale,The way one of our own stood in front of a crossbow to prevent a murder.
Gale,The way you got Kagha to release the girl.
Gale,The way we got Kagha to release the girl.
Gale,We can't afford to let that happen. 
Gale,What in the hells are you doing?
Gale,Hells. His mind crumpled like a piece of parchment.
Gale,The way you handled Nettie when she poisoned you.
Gale,The way you got that boy out of a harpy's clutches.
Gale,The way you followed the protocol and brought me back to life.
Gale,All three stones - we have what we need to dominate the elder brain.
Gale,These deeds attest to a strong and noble character. They attest to prime leadership qualities as well.
Gale,In short: I've grown to trust you.
Gale,The reason I make a point of saying this is that I've grown confident enough to tell you something I've yet to tell another living soul. Except for my cat.
Gale,The way you defused the tension between Zevlor and Aradin.
Gale,"Ever since you were kind enough to free me from that stone, I've seen you demonstrate remarkable guile and courage."
Gale,"Florrick's fate may not yet be sealed, if we care to intervene."
Gale,"I'm not imagining it, am I? These rats' grasp of language seems to be improving."
Gale,Too late for that!
Gale,"Come, come, these are mere fabled objects of great to enormous value."
Gale,My continued presence though - quite priceless!
Gale,We'll need to find a way to unlock the book first.
Gale,One source of lethal explosive power in our party is quite enough. It seems ill-advised to add another.
Gale,I can imagine no finer ceremorph for the job.
Gale,I urge you to reconsider. There could be consequences beyond our ken.
Gale,"I see the art of eloquence is alive and well. I'm awed, impressed, and a little bit scared of you right now."
Gale,Please.
Gale,"As rats go, this one seems to be somewhat of an eccentric."
Gale,Defiant little fellow. Seems oddly... purposeful.
Gale,Extraordinary behaviour. There's more to these rats than meets their beady little eyes.
Gale,"Don't get me wrong, you did well! The somatic component, the vocal component, even the focus on the inner self that invites Mystra in."
Gale,"Why don't we take a little break? Allow ourselves a few moments of rest. Gives me a chance to talk to you about something, well, rather important."
Gale,Putting two and two together I see.
Gale,"We've been on the road together for a while now, haven't we? Survived some perils, overcame some obstacles."
Gale,I can assure the battlefield would extend well beyond the borders of my body alone.
Gale,So he's the one who killed all the Dark Justiciars. Alone. Might not want to get on his bad side.
Gale,"While two devils fight over a bone - well, we should just run away and let them sort it among themselves."
Gale,"You see, I have this... condition. Very different from the parasite we share, but just as deadly."
Gale,"I'll spare you the finer details, but it begins with a simple biological deterioration. Muscle spasms, disorientation, a slight ringing in the ears. And if left for too long..."
Gale,Catastrophe.
Gale,Look at the thing... A few more tastes of its own medicine and it'll burst.
Gale,Was this once a man? The shadows have corrupted him beyond comprehension.
Gale,It's been days since I last consumed an artefact - since before we were abducted. It is time.
Gale,Looks like he's not all there - in more ways than one.
Gale,Consume the Shadow Weave.
Gale,"I'm sorry it had to come to this, Arabella. You were brave and fierce beyond your years."
Gale,Cleanse the corpse. Destroy this tainted power.
Gale,It's been days since I last consumed an artefact - since before we were abducted. It's only a matter of time before my craving returns.
Gale,"That is why I turn to you. I need you to help me find magic items to consume. It is vital. Dare I say it, critical. "
Gale,"As luck would have it, Faerûn is full of them, though I do feel obliged to point out that items of power tend to be in the hands of the powerful."
Gale,There will be danger involved - or great cost.
Gale,This corpse... It's Arabella's father. The horror of his end I daren't contemplate.
Gale,This corpse... It's Arabella's mother. The horror of her end I daren't contemplate.
Gale,"A dead tiefling. Arabella's father, no doubt. The horror of his end I daren't contemplate."
Gale,Leave it be.
Gale,"I'm sure a summons from Mystra will appear soon enough, but until then, I propose we celebrate our victory as mortals do best - with a drink in our hands, and reckless abandon in our hearts. "
Gale,"Wait, that's Arabella, is it not? Looks like she's got some new Weave up her sleeve."
Gale,"That was rather inhospitable. She could well die out there, we should go after her."
Gale,And it would take one wizard to unleash a cataclysm powerful enough to tear apart the brain's very being. We have no choice but to consider using the orb.
Gale,"The specifics are rather personal, but suffice it to say that it is a malady I have learned to live with - though not without some effort."
Gale,"No, no - nothing like that. Though if I fail to treat it then the consequences would not be contained to me alone."
Gale,"No, it cannot be cured. And I assure you I've left no page unturned in reaching that conclusion."
Gale,"If what is happening is what I think is happening, and it's because you licked a dead spider - the time might just have come when you and I should split ways.<br>"
Gale,You licked a dead spider. Dead spider. You licked it. That is something that happened.
Gale,I think we need to get you some air and perhaps have a long talk about unresolved childhood issues.
Gale,"Stubborn little tyke! Even if she can swing a spell or two, she's going to get herself killed out here."
Gale,Stop licking the damn thing!<br>
Gale,What it comes down to is this: every so often I need to get my hands on a powerful magical item and absorb the Weave inside.
Gale,Arabella's father. Poor man met a ghoulish end.
Gale,That must be Arabella's father. Poor man met a ghoulish end.
Gale,I can say no more on the matter - not now anyway.
Gale,Just trust me when I say it's all of vital importance.
Gale,"Staffs, tomes, cowls - the form doesn't matter, so long as it's brimming with Weave."
Gale,Trust me when I say - the loss of the occasional wizard's staff or tome of enchantment is a bargain given the cost of allowing me to deteriorate.
Gale,"I can keep this condition under control, as indeed I've done for a significant amount of time, but that was under different circumstances altogether. Home, in Waterdeep."
Gale,And don't think I've forgotten!
Gale,"Perhaps with this offering, she'll finally cure me of the affliction of the orb."
Gale,"No kind the world will suffer for the absence of. And, I hope, there are plenty on mortal soil who would regret my absence."
Gale,"Obvious, when you stop to think about it."
Gale,"Well, I doubt it's an apology for asking me to die on her behalf."
Gale,"Whatever it is, if it's important enough to send Elminster, we can be damned sure she's serious."
Gale,"Not scared. Not yet. But she's shaken, if she feels the need to intervene directly."
Gale,"This is a conversation that's long overdue on both sides. I owe it to her to hear her out, come what may afterwards."
Gale,Can't you feel it? We're almost there.
Gale,"Once we ascend the Netherbrain's stem, we'll be in touching distance of the crown. Of reclaiming the powers of Karsus himself. "
Gale,I'm ready. Are you?
Gale,"And I would die in the process, just to win the favour of a goddess who scarcely cares for me. We discussed this at length - I thought you and I were of a similar mind."
Gale,"I could simply tell you what you want to hear, then ascend by myself and seize the Crown anyway, you know."
Gale,Sometimes I wish I were a more selfish man. Life would be so much easier. But alas...
Gale,You're right. The orb is the only way. All that's left for me to do is spirit you away to safety. Are you ready?
Gale,Please... this will be so much easier knowing that my memory lives on with you.
Gale,"No. Let me do this on my terms. Besides - I need someone left to sing my praises, after I'm gone."
Gale,No... I would not presume that. I know quality when I see it.
Gale,"It has. And a pleasure, a privilege, a tale for the ages, and if I'm being honest... the very best time I've had in my entire life."
Gale,"Naturally. Irenicus, or 'The Exile', sought to extract divinity from Bhaalspawn blood. Needless to say, he failed in quite catastrophic fashion - hence the cautionary part of the tale."
Gale,"Until we wake, my friend."
Gale,"Until we wake, my love."
Gale,The way we handled Nettie when she wanted to poison us.
Gale,"What, no rest for the dashing? Pish posh."
Gale,"Spare me a moment, if you please. I've something important to discuss with you."
Gale,"That said, necessity compels me to set aside my reservations. I have no choice but to speak."
Gale,Command it to die. Quickly! 
Gale,Ignore it. Nothing but a vile death rattle. 
Gale,We've been travelling together for a while now and I think it's safe to say we don't always see eye to eye.
Gale,"But it won't come to that, for I have the means to spirit away those I care about to a safe remove, before the final curtain."
Gale,We've been travelling together for a while now and it's just about time that I shared something with you.
Gale,"Tiring business, isn't it? All this travelling and adventuring."
Gale,"So, all it took to get Mystra's attention was to learn how to reforge an artefact that once destroyed her. "
Gale,"Up you go then, Gale. Best make this count... The whole world's watching."
Gale,"Thrall? No, I think you're mistaken. The name's Gale of Waterdeep. A pleasure to make your acquaintance."
Gale,"We've tried our very best, but it seems victory is beyond our grasp, I'm sad to say."
Gale,"At least, victory in which we live to tell the tale."
Gale,"Don't worry - I'll handle matters from here. And gods willing, there'll be plenty of folk left to tell our tale after we're gone."
Gale,"It's a rather personal matter that I'd have preferred to keep quiet, but needs must when the devil drives. I have no choice but to speak."
Gale,"Your duty, perhaps. Mine was quite the opposite. Every breath I take - however gratefully -  is proof of my dereliction."
Gale,"I thought I meant more to you than a sacrificial lamb. Clearly I was mistaken. I will not cast everything away, not when I know what's out there, almost within my grasp."
Gale,"You urged me to this point, and now you falter? What would you have me do, sacrifice myself and hope that Mystra eulogises my ashes?"
Gale,"There's endless wonder out there. Infinite possibilities. Perhaps fate will bring us back together, before the universe dims."
Gale,Fugamus inferni blandimenta.
Gale,"What I want is a life I could share with you, but alas... knowing you're still out there will suffice for now."
Gale,"What I want? Perhaps not... But what I need? I believe so. But it may not be the last turn of the page, even if it seems so."
Gale,"Still, you will be taking unnecessary risks by proceeding. This could all be over in mere moments, if I ascend alone."
Gale,"True, but it's not too late to reconsider. This would all be over in mere moments, if I ascend alone."
Gale,"As much as I enjoy your company, I'm not willing to kill you just to wring out a few last moments."
Gale,The Netherstones might prove more effective if we use them now.
Gale,The figure from my dreams...<br>
Gale,What in the Hells are those?
Gale,As viable a plan as any while staring into the maw of perdition. Shall we?
Gale,Besides - such a sacrifice won't be necessary if I claim the Crown of Karsus.
Gale,"If there is even the slimmest chance of success once we ascend, I wish to pursue it."
Gale,"If I live at all, it will be no thanks to her. She didn't even deign to speak to me herself. Let her burn with fury - I choose to live."
Gale,No. I can't give up... and I don't want this to be how I part from you. Let us at least try.
Gale,"For now, at least."
Gale,"Lead on, then. I shall stay my hand as long as I can - but if the tide of battle turns against us, remember I have the means to bring a swift end to this."
Gale,Mystra won't be pleased... but perhaps trying to please the gods is a fool's errand.
Gale,But... I only made it this far thanks to you. Who am I to question such sterling guidance now?
Gale,"If you're wrong, we'll have squandered the chance for a better world. You understand that, don't you?"
Gale,"But... perhaps saving the day will suffice for now. A better world can always follow, so long as we survive."
Gale,So be it - lead on.
Gale,Your fears are misplaced - the Crown will lead to a better world for all. I cannot ignore that.
Gale,"Then I think it's about time we ascended, don't you?"
Gale,"Should it come to that, I will not hesitate. But I think a different destiny awaits us."
Gale,"I can end this now - stop the Absolute, and spare the city. The stage is set for my final act. Mystra's bidding. And the redemption that lies beyond."
Gale,"If the fight should turn against us, and we have no other option, then rest assured I shall unleash the orb. But I believe there is a much grander destiny in store for us."
Gale,"You've brought me right where I need to be - I have no right to ask more of you. It's time I spirited you to safety, for this is a fate I must face alone."
Gale,"It's just a choice between two deaths. Quick and meaningful, or torturous and pointless."
Gale,"I'm sure such an outcome is possible, but why risk it? If we ascend there, and try to fight the good fight... well, there're no guarantees."
Gale,"But this way, we'll know the matter is done, and we'll know exactly what it shall cost - me, and me alone."
Gale,"It's now, or never."
Gale,"This isn't giving up it's securing victory, at a price I am willing to pay. And everything we shared can live on - with you. "
Gale,You'd be dying in vain. I don't need company to sacrifice myself.
Gale,"If you're mistaken, this could be the end of everything. We will be failing, right at the last hurdle."
Gale,"What's the alternative? I allow the Absolute to have its way? Die in vain along with all its victims? Or flee, and live on in shame?"
Gale,"I won't lie. I'll miss our group. Hells, I'll even miss sleeping rough in the wilderness, to an extent.<br>"
Gale,Truly? I don't know how you could even contemplate taking to the road after the journey we've been on.<br>
Gale,"Perhaps we can circle back to that one, once the fires have died and the rubble's settled. I do think we deserve a little rest."
Gale,What are you doing?! Stop!
Gale,"No doubt she needs a moment alone with her thoughts. Who wouldn't, after all she's been through?"
Gale,She's taking the long route back to camp. Her time with us is running short - no doubt she's many thoughts to get in order.
Gale,We're short a tiefling - where is Karlach?
Gale,"Take whatever time you need to consider. I hope, when the reality of my condition sets in, you may yet be convinced to change your mind."
Gale,"Keeping me in suspense, are you? Come on, tell me, do we have an agreement or not?"
Gale,"It's a simple question, isn't it? What gives you pause?"
Gale,What?!
Gale,You used that thing against me? And you saw! After I told you...
Gale,You had no right! None at all! I've a good mind to turn around and depart this little company of ours immediately.
Gale,I'd rather be alone than spend another moment in the presence of someone inclined to such unjustified invasions of privacy.
Gale,"The need remains debatable, but I recognise your responsibility."
Gale,"Perhaps my reaction was a tad volatile, the irony of which is not lost on me. Though it needs remain so on you, for the time being."
Gale,I hope that the glimpse you caught on my condition convinced you of the urgency in treating it. Can I count on you to give me the artefacts I need?
Gale,That is a lie and you know it.
Gale,"I think it might be time for you to find a shadier spot, my friend. If I'm not mistaken, you're beginning to burn... "
Gale,Very well. You're clearly in no mood to be receptive to my request at present.
Gale,I don't know how else I can explain the imperative nature of this issue. You can't simply dismiss it.
Gale,"If you think iron bars will be enough to contain you, I fear you'll be in for a rather nasty shock. It's your mind that is your greatest asset, always has been. That's the one I'd watch. "
Gale,A wise suggestion. 
Gale,I fell to hubris once before and landed myself with this orb. I think I'd rather not make the same mistake again. 
Gale,"With the Crown in my hands, I would be unstoppable."
Gale,"And once I have, I'll take it to Mystra. "
Gale,"If I salvage the stones, I could retrieve it. "
Gale,Perhaps even wield it. 
Gale,Perhaps that's the best place for it. Away from the meddling of mortals and Mystra alike. 
Gale,This is where we part ways.
Gale,"It's not exactly the outcome Elminster hoped I would achieve, but it's the best I could do with the time his charm bought for me."
Gale,But it's a journey I'd rather set out on with a good meal and a rest to my name. And a nightcap wouldn't go amiss. 
Gale,"A sound idea. It shouldn't take long to find him either - a wizard who cannot refrain from imparting his wisdom to the world... well, you know yourself how easy it is to find one of those. "
Gale,Fear not - the orb is quite safe for the time being. I've a window in which to consider my options. 
Gale,"If you'd prefer me to follow my own course from here, I understand. I've no desire to put you, or what's left of this city at risk. "
Gale,"If there's one thing I've taken from this adventure of ours, it's that some things are best left well alone. That Crown being one of them. "
Gale,Such a force of destruction deserves to rust in a watery grave. And I've no intention of diving down to salvage it. 
Gale,"No, all I want now is a meal, a rest, and perhaps a nightcap to round it all off. "
Gale,I feel the faintest pricklings of hunger from the orb already. It will not remain under the sway of his spell forever. 
Gale,I have to admit you're right about that.
Gale,I am a fool. A fool to have trusted you.
Gale,So be it.
Gale,"Speaking of githyanki, what about you Lae'zel? Will you be joining them? "
Gale,"I am what I am - I never lied to you, I've merely been economical with the truth. "
Gale,"Thank you for the offer, but the treatment for my condition is very specific."
Gale,"I was being quite sincere, I assure you."
Gale,"Be that as it may, my trust is yours."
Gale,The way we got that boy out of a harpy's clutches.
Gale,Your intellect will be valuable indeed. So long as it remains uncorrupted. 
Gale,The githyanki are departing in peace. A curious sight in a day already full of them.
Gale,"And so long as it doesn't please you to munch on my cerebellum, I'll be right behind you."
Gale,"The Underdark? Not exactly on the top of my list, but I think I understand why the idea appeals to you. "
Gale,We should drink. Perhaps there's an inn still standing. Every drop will be well-deserved.<br>
Gale,"I suppose that's the last time any of us will see him, and the last time he'll ever see the sun. "
Gale,"Now, without wishing to cause undue alarm, might I suggest we find some shade? I think the sun is reneging on that truce of yours."
Gale,There are many heroes' graves that will need to be dug. Many eulogies to be written.
Gale,Let's honour them each and all - but preferably with a drink in hand.<br>
Gale,"You're right of course. But, well... I'll miss you, friend. Your companionship has been quite the education. "
Gale,"It's far from the fate you deserve for the scale of your sacrifice, but I understand why you feel the need to do it. "
Gale,And what kind of god would I be? 
Gale,"Lae'zel, don't!"
Gale,"No - no, it's nothing like that. Magic isn't a narcotic to me, it's quite literally a life-saver."
Gale,What are you... You're using the tadpole against me?
Gale,So? Do you agree?
Gale,"I'm afraid that's not going to work on me. Look, I appreciate your curiosity, but don't pursue this path."
Gale,Let us agree on actions first and explanations later. Yes?
Gale,Then I suggest you look closer.
Gale,"Against all odds, we cured ourselves. Free from the parasite. Free from the prospect of ceremorphosis. I can hardly believe it. I will not become an accursed illithid!"
Gale,"Against all odds, we cured ourselves. Free from the parasite. Free from the prospect of ceremorphosis. I can hardly believe it. We will not become accursed illithids!"
Gale,"I would not burden anyone other than myself with this were the stakes not so high, and the means of obtaining such artefacts challenging for a humble wizard to face alone."
Gale,It's over. It's truly over.
Gale,We've already done the finding. In fact you have one in your possession.
Gale,"You know for yourself how hard won such an item was, and it will be no easier when even more are required to assuage my hunger."
Gale,"A fair point - however, until recently I was able to rely on a supply of artefacts stored in my tower in Waterdeep. A  supply that has now run dry."
Gale,The reality of the matter is that a lone wizard with a chronic impairment such as my own is not in the most ideal of situations with regards to self-defence.
Gale,The manner of artefacts I need are not often found waiting patiently on a shop-keep's shelf. One usually has to lift them delicately from trap-filled tombs or prise them from the hands of violent ne'erdowells.
Gale,"You have my thanks. And fear not - your implicit trust is well placed, and will be rewarded with any and all means at my disposal."
Gale,Please. I've better things to do with my time than hoodwink gullible adventurers out of their trinkets.
Gale,"The loss of a mind is a terrible thing... but this time, I think I'll make an exception."
Gale,Plenty to look forward to.
Gale,"Cruelty and cleverness are all too common bedfellows. Let's side with cleverness alone, shall we? See what we can do to save this verse-loving pixie."
Gale,"Gods, I'd pay a king's ransom for a hot, lavender-scented bath - minstrels serenading as I close my eyes and let the water's warmth dissolve all woes."
Gale,"A fascinating structure. Made of living flesh, or merely a simulacrum? "
Gale,"A question for another time - for now, we'd best focus on finding a way out."
Gale,Let's hope Shadowheart's actions do not return to haunt her. I know they would haunt me.
Gale,Halsin does not deserve to die on such a craven's altar.
Gale,"A natural impulse to try and shield one's loved ones from danger, especially when you feel a moral compunction to run head-first towards it."
Gale,"I suspect any child of Jaheira's will share her self-destructive sense of justice, but at least her words give them pause for thought."
Gale,"A shame it's so dank and decayed down here - I suspect there's a wealth of history to be uncovered, if any could hold their breath long enough to find it."
Gale,"At last, we find a beacon of light amongst the darkness. And not a moment too soon - I'm quite ready for some respite."
Gale,I think it's about time we imposed ourselves on Raphael's hospitality for a change.
Gale,"He's laid a fine trap for you, Mol. But it looks to me like his Cyric could be dethroned."
Gale,"That's... certainly another strategy. A losing one, but a strategy nonetheless."
Gale,"I see that glint in your eyes. You've a strategy in mind. The same one as me, I'd wager."
Gale,"Don't worry, I've no interest in prizing that artefact from your grip. Your secrets are yours to keep."
Gale,"This is the seat of the Absolute's power. Whatever the 'Heart' is, it's connected to this place somehow. We must find out."
Gale,"What joy, to have found the nadir of common decency. Let's conclude our business here quickly, and never speak of it again."
Gale,"Whatever these dark powers of yours may be, they serve no purpose if you cannot control them. Or yourself. What a terrible waste."
Gale,At least Shadowheart is armed with the truth now. May its keen edge draw forth whatever vengeance she desires.
Gale,"Your head must be spinning, to learn such a truth. Dame Aylin's revelations can't have been easy to stomach, but know that you will not be alone, when the time comes to act upon them."
Gale,"Still, such conflicts will not serve our party well in resolving this little parasite problem of ours. Best we cast from the same spell book from now on."
Gale,"So, a vampire lord walks among us. A powerful ally to have at our side, and a powerful enemy should our intentions diverge. "
Gale,Things get more interesting by the moment.
Gale,"I sense the difference in you already. You seem sharper, leaner, hungrier."
Gale,I quite like it.
Gale,The Astral Plane. Mortals such as we are not meant for this place. We must tread carefully.
Gale,Time for us to take a rather literal 'leap of faith'.
Gale,"Shar may punish you, but she does not have claim on you any longer. Resisting her is a triumph in itself, however much it hurts."
Gale,"Behold, the consequences of your actions."
Gale,Poor Shadowheart. The gods are nothing if not vindictive in their vengeance.
Gale,The Gur are certainly efficient. Astarion's fate will not be an easy one. Nor painless.
Gale,"What a thrill, to wander the corridors of the forge of tyranny itself. Better keep our thoughts to ourselves - who knows what might be listening to us here?"
Gale,An ally fresh from the Hells themselves. Our company grows stranger by the minute - and all the better for it.
Gale,"That's one scourge eliminated. A vampire with that much power would be a death sentence for this city. A pity Astarion didn't understand that. Or rather, didn't care."
Gale,"Of all the places I expected we'd find this Minsc, crawling from the broken jaws of a mimic wasn't high on my list. What's life without a few surprises, eh?"
Gale,We cannot afford to lose focus now. Not when the brain is so close. We press on.
Gale,"Lae'zel had the makings of a formidable ally, if one prone to acts of impulsive violence."
Gale,Shar's domain is a far cry from Mystra's. The Weave's light is truly extinguished by such darkness.
Gale,"But you don't need me to tell you this. You're here about something else, I'll wager?"
Gale,"Hunting one devil, allying yourself with another. Our journey gets more curious by the second."
Gale,"Such creatures are not to be trusted, as a general rule, though this one does appear to have had a significant hand in our survival up to this point."
Gale,"You did a good thing back there. I won't dwell on the matter - I know that's not a sentiment you're accustomed to revelling in, but rest assured - your actions have spoken for themselves."
Gale,"A savvy move, recruiting Halsin to our cause."
Gale,"The hammer we claimed is of incredible arcane craftsmanship. No wonder it was so fiercely protected. In the wrong hands, who knows what it might shatter..."
Gale,"I hope you're still in one piece after that little reunion. Take it from me - your taste in company has much improved, if those spawn were anything to go by. Good riddance to them."
Gale,"Not the kind of excitement I usually enjoy being woken up for. Still, better than not waking up at all. Or waking up as something else entirely."
Gale,"A disturbed and disturbing night for all of us, but worth it. With due diligence, your impulses will soon be mastered. Or at least, prevented from causing further harm."
Gale,"Revenge is a dish best served hot, it seems. At least when Karlach is in charge of the menu."
Gale,"She deserves more time to enjoy her victory. Still, there's solace to be found in surrendering one's mortality in a blaze of glory. Or so I hear."
Gale,The underdark has a certain menacing beauty to it. Though I'd be happier admiring it from a safe distance.
Gale,"Civilisation beckons at last. It's no Waterdeep, but Baldur's Gate is a respectable runner-up. Or at least a close third."
Gale,I've not felt the presence of the Shadow Weave like this since we left behind that cursed darkness. We must be on our guard.
Gale,"Bested by simple vampire spawn, our companion snatched like a rattle from a babe. "
Gale,"Astarion's fate depends on us. Given our resounding failure to protect him in the first place, I'm not sure I fancy his chances."
Gale,Do you feel as flattered as I do? Invited to dine with a devil...
Gale,Come now. Of all people I'd think you'd see through his bluster.
Gale,"Jaheira made her choice, however unwise it may be to divide our efforts at this juncture. A shame, but we'll forge ahead without her."
Gale,"A pity Shadowheart was the price of it, but the 'Lady of Loss' will take her dues. Our loss is our gain, so to speak."
Gale,"Quite something, to have devotees of the Shar herself sworn to our cause."
Gale,"Hardly the noblest conflict we've encountered, but criminals will have their squabbles, even in the looming shadow of utter annihilation."
Gale,"At best, an ally whose motivations remain shrouded in deceit. We should be wary of what such an alliance may cost us."
Gale,"So, this is the seat of the Absolute's power? Every bit as vile as the cultists who flock here, by the looks of it."
Gale,"Another day, another god trying to make us her playthings. We'll have the whole pantheon interfering with us if we're not careful."
Gale,"Gods, I hate spiders."
Gale,"At last, we stand on the cusp of victory. A narrower precipice than I hoped, but it's our destiny to traverse it nonetheless."
Gale,"The brain will succumb, and these halls will echo with our deeds for generations. Greatness awaits."
Gale,"If there's heroism to be found in politics, I'm sure you'll find it. Somewhere..."
Gale,"Quite the rug pull, eh? A mind flayer manipulating us this whole time."
Gale,"If there's heroism to be found in politics, I'm sure Wyll will find it. Somewhere..."
Gale,"I've known a few warlocks in my time. Talented, of course, though sometimes too eager to listen to the devils on their shoulders. Comes with the territory, unfortunately."
Gale,"Time and again, your plight reinforces my decision not to pursue the path of a warlock."
Gale,"Time and again, Wyll's plight reinforces my decision not to pursue the path of a warlock."
Gale,"It's one thing to make such a sacrifice in the pursuit of such a pact, but to do so in order to escape one. Truly, it leaves you with nothing."
Gale,Nothing like the stench of human effluence to make you regret any and all prior life decisions. 
Gale,"Fascinating as our surroundings are, we must press on. If our runaway general is down here, the Heart of the Absolute will be too."
Gale,We must reach Ketheric. He will lead us to the Heart of the Absolute.
Gale,You should try to get some rest. Hard to save the world if you're stifling yawns.
Gale,Your siblings could use a dose of your cynicism. Anyone cruel enough to pursue such a means to power has no intention of sharing it. 
Gale,"Karlach's fate may be ordained, but her actions are not. She will make each breath count - we can be sure of that."
Gale,"Your fate may be ordained, but your actions are not. Make each breath count, and what time you have with us will never be wasted."
Gale,"A valid point. But I think it's safe to assume that were the boot on the other foot, they'd have few regrets. Ruthlessness cuts both ways. And crushes too."
Gale,"Not all deaths are so laden with import, on this plane or any other. The best we can do is live well, and hope the death that comes for us is quick. And preferably painless. I think we gave them that, at least."
Gale,"What's done is done, and what remains to be done allows no great periods of introspection on such matters. Unless there's something else to discuss, we should press on."
Gale,"What you did for your parents was a profound act of love. I won't dwell on the matter, but know that you showed immense courage. They would be proud."
Gale,"What Shadowheart did for her parents was a profound act of love. Her courage is... well, it's quite something to behold."
Gale,There's no more radiant sight than that of someone who's learned to love themselves anew. 
Gale,"Shadowed in name, but no longer in spirit. It suits you."
Gale,"Shadowed in name, but no longer in spirit. It suits her."
Gale,"Druids will always follow nature's purpose over any mortal threat. Halsin goes where he is needed, as must we."
Gale,The bustle here takes some getting used to. A crackling fire and a tressym for company is usually more my speed.
Gale,"Still, we must flow with the current we find ourselves in, however tumultuous it may be. If you've need of me, I'm glad to help."
Gale,Sounds like we're not the only ones tracking down this 'Minsc' fellow. Let's hope Nine-Fingers' bounty doesn't attract too much competition.
Gale,"That githyanki officer didn't come here merely to fill our ears with idle gossip. Who resides within the artefact, I wonder?"
Gale,Whatever Voss might have known about its occupant is lost to us now. Let's hope he and his alliance are aid we can do without.
Gale,"Even the venerable Harpers are compromised by the Absolute's poison. A grim turn of events, but one we must take in our stride."
Gale,"A valid point. As survival strategies go, raising your young in a building rigged to self-destruct is a rather poor one. No doubt they'd have found that out for themselves eventually."
Gale,"I know those githyanki weren't your kin per se, but I hope you know it gives me no pleasure that our actions condemned them to such a fate."
Gale,"Of all the things I anticipated our foray into that monastery achieving, bringing the whole thing down around our ears wasn't one of them. Life is just full of surprises."
Gale,"Not entirely sure that was a wise decision. Better the devil you know, I suppose. The one Wyll knows, at least."
Gale,"Given the magnitude of what we're up against, I see no harm in considering the benefit this offer might afford us. It could be the only way to reach this 'source' in one piece."
Gale,"Dame Aylin has little to feel sorry about - Lorroakan would have inflicted a far worse fate on her, given the chance."
Gale,You look remarkably perky. Nothing like a good night's sleep to restore the senses.
Gale,"Githyanki patrolling these wilds is an unexpected surprise. Whatever they seek, they'll not hesitate to kill us if we stand in their way."
Gale,"I didn't expect to meet your kin patrolling these wilds so openly. Whatever they're seeking, they clearly feel no need to hide their efforts. Or their urgency."
Gale,"Hmm. Go on then, state your business with me. From a safe distance, if it's all the same to you."
Gale,"A brave choice, to kill the child of one god at the behest of another. Your loyalty plumbs darker depths than I anticipated.<br>"
Gale,"Do not be lured in by the Astral Plane's beauty. It is a lethal expanse, one we should be careful in attempting to cross."
Gale,"A brave choice, to kill the child of one god at the behest of another. Shadowheart's loyalty plumbs darker depths than I anticipated."
Gale,"Let's hope the fruits of this cruel labour are to her advantage. And ours, of course."
Gale,"Raphael revealed a cruel truth, but believe me when I say it is one you are more powerful for learning."
Gale,"My opinion on such matters would be an uninformed one, I'm afraid. But is there anything within my expertise you wished to discuss?"
Gale,The people of Faerûn will be well served with you as their champion.<br>
Gale,The people of Faerûn will be well served with Wyll as their champion.
Gale,'The Blade of Frontiers. A fitting title for one so steeled with purpose.
Gale,"Not entirely sure that was a wise decision. Better the devil you know, I suppose."
Gale,"Let's hope the fruits of this cruel labour are to your advantage. And ours, of course."
Gale,Your new lease on life suits you rather well. What do you and your newborn vitality require of me?
Gale,"Trust me when I say you're better off living unshaded by Shar's influence. Such a goddess would take everything from you, and still demand more."
Gale,"I hope Shadowheart's parents are a welcome balm for her wounds. There will be pain in defying such a malicious goddess, but perhaps no more than in obeying her."
Gale,"Some thoughts are best left unfinished. Now, please tell me there's some other subject you wish to occupy my mind with?"
Gale,Glad to see I'm not the only one on the wrong side of an omnipotent authority figure.
Gale,You did well to break free of Vlaakith's manipulations. Though I doubt Vlaakith will let such insubordination go unpunished.
Gale,Lae'zel did well to break free of Vlaakith's manipulations. Though I doubt Vlaakith will let such insubordination go unpunished.
Gale,Not sure now is the time for chatter. There's a raging inferno surrounding us.
Gale,"No amount of contracts will save Raphael from the fate we forced upon him. A devil well-slain, if I say so myself."
Gale,"This Orphic Hammer sounds like quite the artefact. One I'll have no desire to consume, if that's your concern."
Gale,"Is it me, or is the ground here particularly sticky? Almost as if..."
Gale,"Whatever ancient purpose is imbued in these halls, it may not welcome our presence here. We should be wary of whatever lurks beneath the dust."
Gale,Glad to see we all made it through the night intact. A promising sign that we may be able to curb those urges of yours.
Gale,"Now as the saying goes, 'What's left undone should be left unspoken.' Is there some lighter subject you wish to discuss?"
Gale,"The living may not be prevented from crossing a vampire's threshold, but that doesn't make us any more welcome. Tread carefully."
Gale,I feel the Weave growing more distant by the moment. We walk Shar's path now - best we don't spend too long in her shadow.
Gale,"Your father owes you his gratitude. I hope for your sake he is gracious enough to offer it, given what it cost."
Gale,"Wyll's father owes him gratitude. I hope for his sake Ravengaard is gracious enough to offer it, given how much it cost."
Gale,"I know well the pain of seeing your life's hourglass running empty, grasping at any means of slowing the grains as they slip inexorably through your fingers."
Gale,"I've never had cause to visit a druid's grove before. Magic weighs heavier here, seeking solace in root and soil. Grounding, one might say."
Gale,All that talk of desperation? It merely illustrates his own.
Gale,"Fear not - I shall do nothing to embarass you amongst your peers. Where you lead, I follow with good humour, and the hope we might yet leave with both dignity and spleens unpunctured."
Gale,A real githyanki crèche. Few outsiders learn the secrets of such places. Fewer still live to share their observations. A keen eye and a quiet tongue may serve us well here.
Gale,Well that's my chances of a beauty sleep thoroughly ruined for the evening...
Gale,I imagine Wyll thought he'd have longer to enjoy the perks of his powers.
Gale,Such pacts always collect their dues in the end. His suffering has only just begun.
Gale,"Orin toys with us where she could destroy us. Whatever her motivations, I hope she reveals them quickly."
Gale,What's done is done. No sense delaying further.
Gale,"Come on then, don't leave me in suspense. How are you feeling? No errant tentacles? No sudden cravings for a more cerebral diet?"
Gale,"Wonderful. Advantages are a more precious commodity than I'd have hoped, given the nature of our predicament. "
Gale,"You can learn a lot about people when you understand the manner of their upbringing. Our time here will shed new light on your little quirks, I'm quite sure."
Gale,"I commend you on your willingness to take such a risk. Now, let's hope your new, illithid-fuelled prowess tip the balance suitably  in our favour."
Gale,"Famously humourless, illithids. The tyrannical enslavement of all other living creatures hardly lends itself to levity. Should your wit begin to suffer, only then must we worry."
Gale,"I was rather more curious to know what benefits the tadpole might have bestowed, but no doubt the benefits of your change in diet will become apparent soon enough."
Gale,Was there another matter you wished to discuss?
Gale,Do you feel that? The Hells themselves tremble to face such a scourge as you threaten to be.
Gale,Do you feel that? The Hells themselves tremble to face such a scourge as Wyll threatens to be.
Gale,"'The Blade of Avernus.' Forged by a cambion, whetted on a dragon's hide. Those devils won't know what's coming for them."
Gale,"Tyranny offers only two fates for the tyrant - infamy, or ignomy. I'm glad we were able to offer Gortash the latter. "
Gale,"Replete with ribaldry, as always. Well, you could provide no better proof that you are not, in fact, about to turn into a mind flayer. "
Gale,I think he wants something from us. Badly. And in that knowledge lies our opportunity.
Gale,"Conjecture, yes - that much I concede."
Gale,But let me play the devil's advocate: the man is too eager. Do not dismiss his offer out of hand.
Gale,"I made a promise to my goddess. One I will do my best to keep. For the sake of this city, I can only hope that my best will be enough."
Gale,"I challenged my goddess, defied her will, and promised her destruction. "
Gale,"Fail to get the crown after all that, and if the embarrassment doesn't finish me off, Mystra might."
Gale,"I don't dare to picture the crown in my hands - not when there's the small matter of an enormous, city-conquering brain beneath it."
Gale,I don't dare to imagine making such a decision when there's the small matter of the enormous brain beneath the crown still to overcome.
Gale,"Ask me again when the illithid scourge has been wiped from this city, and I'll have an answer for you. Until then - it's best not to count on anything."
Gale,"Perhaps its for the best. Freeing them could have unleashed chaos, and the thought of killing them is more than I could stomach."
Gale,So many dead... we'll never wash this blood from our hands.
Gale,They have their freedom... but what of the city? Have we just unleashed a plague onto the streets?
Gale,"I'm cautiously optimistic. Though with the time left to us, and the amount still to be done, it's best we don't take anything for granted."
Gale,"Who knows what shape these final moments of ours might assume? Not I. Not Mystra. Not even you. But whatever my fate might be, I'll be glad to greet it in such fine company."
Gale,"Strolling these streets together would have been quite magical, in other circumstances. This is all a tad apocalyptic for my liking."
Gale,You're okay - thank the heavens and hells and everything in between. I thought the brain would take you from me.
Gale,"I'm not sure I ever considered the Emperor an ally, exactly, but even so, it's strange to know we're on our own at last."
Gale,"The High Hall was once a beacon of promise, of wisdom, of celebration. Now... well , it's just a beacon, and for all manner of horrors. A pity."
Gale,"'When?' I'm glad you have such confidence in our endeavour. I confess, my own's not constructed from such immutable materials."
Gale,"But I'm ready, if that's the word you need to hear. If you call on me, I will not let you down."
Gale,I'd need a ream of parchment longer than an elder brain's stem to capture the tumult I feel at that particular prospect.
Gale,"When this is all over, we'll have time enough to unpick the specifics of your new condition. Psionics alone could take months to thoroughly evaluate, not to mention the matter of your diet - "
Gale,"Fate seems determined to make a mindflayer of you. It remains your choice, as the crown remains mine."
Gale,"The scent of Netheril hangs heavy in this place. The brain is close, as is the crown. I'm glad we face such a monster together."
Gale,"The aura of Netheril hangs heavy in this place. The brain is close, as is the crown. As is victory, dare we begin to hope..."
Gale,"These tadpoles come from an ancient colony down below the tower. Whatever we do with them, we must deny their use to the Absolute.<br>"
Gale,"Burn them, I say. Burn them all."
Gale,I don't think it was. 
Gale,A sorry creature. Just enough wits to be able to serve the Absolute.
Gale,"Well, now that we know what it is, I suggest we leave it well alone."
Gale,Curious. Ghouls aren't exactly known for their religious fervour. Why does this one care for the Absolute?
Gale,"Though I confess, the prospect of trying to outwit a brain the size of Mount Waterdeep is a challenge even for me."
Gale,I hope that wasn't our last kiss. I'd take a thousand more if I could.
Gale,They're dead. Z'rell will want to hear of this.
Gale,Z'rell won't be pleased about this - she strikes me as the type to enjoy a little bloodshed.
Gale,I'd reconsider. He's not exactly open to attack just now.
Gale,Minsc - the very same Jaheira seeks.
Gale,"I'd be lying if I said it wouldn't take some getting used to, but what can a few extra tentacles do to a bond as strong as ours?"
Gale,To be so favoured and so blessed! One feels positively riddled with envy.
Gale,Enough of this - release yourself! 
Gale,"Well, you've certainly piqued the interest of the Absolute. Though I can think of at least a dozen gods I'd rather meet."
Gale,"Someone pinch me, please. I'd really love to wake up from this nightmare."
Gale,Continual Flame - an unquenchable light. Costs a queen's crown worth of ruby dust to summon.
Gale,"Gods, it's like a draught of cool water soothing a parched throat - welcome and wonderful."
Gale,He's scarpered - and I suppose it's up to us to find him.
Gale,There was a lot of magic in this artefact. I can't quite remember a time I've felt so peaceful inside.
Gale,It's good to perceive this constant fear repressed into a quiet scare. Let's hope it will last a good long while.
Gale,And I'm impressed once more by your benevolence!
Gale,"I say that with great sincerity. Mere days have passed since our first acquaintance, but you've gained the respect of years."
Gale,"Those beasts still prowl the eternal night, but at least they're afraid of the fire."
Gale,"As such, I do not wish to give you false hope. We're only treating the symptoms, not the cause.<br>"
Gale,Then again - keeps you on your toes.
Gale,"On a more serious note, I do not wish to give you false hope. We're only treating the symptoms, not the cause."
Gale,"That said, this newfound calm I'm experiencing gives me reason to accept without prejudice a certain degree of optimism."
Gale,"Time is a precious gift. With time, we may even reach Baldur's Gate, a city rife with magic, wizards, scholars, and perhaps: solutions."
Gale,And here's to your company.
Gale,"Oh, I can picture it now: academies, libraries, laboratories - the assembled knowledge of centuries that may just set us free."
Gale,"Better yet: soft beds, home cooked meals, and all the other little luxuries this wilderness so brashly denies us."
Gale,"Unpleasant, certainly. Gut wrenching too. Heart rending even, if pinched for an adjective."
Gale,"If it's an audience she desires, an audience let us provide."
Gale,"So long as none of us are on the pointed end of Astarion's hunger pangs, I think he deserves a chance.  "
Gale,"So long as none of us are on the pointed end of his hunger pangs, I think he deserves a chance."
Gale,Please - I need a moment.
Gale,"I can feel the storm abating. Yes, this will keep my condition in check - for a precious while."
Gale,"If they move freely, they must have a Moonlantern. Let's have a little war with that convoy and claim the spoils."
Gale,"If they move freely, they must have some kind of magic that protects them. I'm not averse to claiming that magic indeed."
Gale,This is no typical gloom. Need to stay alert.
Gale,"It's hard to predict the effect any given artefact has, but my condition is hardly a patient one."
Gale,Better be careful around here...
Gale,"You're being rather philosophical about all this, Karlach. I was expecting a more heated response. "
Gale,Rather soon I will feel it stir again - like a distant thunder sending tremors through the soul.
Gale,"In the meantime, my thanks again."
Gale,"My liege, I bow to your boundless kindness!"
Gale,"As long as we travel together, what's mine is yours. And if we survive our many ordeals, I'll host you a banquet in Waterdeep the likes of which you've never seen."
Gale,Such promises will have to wait however. My condition is hardly a patient one.
Gale,Spot on!
Gale,Must have been a wizard at work. I know a Continual Flame spell when I see one.
Gale,A feeling you may have to grow accustomed to while I'm around. My condition is hardly a patient one.
Gale,I will need to consume another artefact before the lightning strikes. There's no choice but to find more.
Gale,"I could simply tell you what you want to hear, then ascend by myself and take on the brain alone, you know."
Gale,"I confess, in my head I saw that going a lot less amicably. I hope our newly-freed ally proves more reliable than the last."
Gale,"There is, of course one more course to consider. The orb. None need shoulder the illithid's burden, if that is what you decide."
Gale,Yours was an escape narrow enough to defy even the tiniest of measuring sticks. Best to apply a touch more caution when agreeing to ambiguous medical procedures in future.
Gale,"We have our orders, from the queen of the githyanki herself, no less. Now might be the time to consider obeying them."
Gale,"We have our orders, from your queen herself, no less. Now might be the time to consider obeying them."
Gale,It seems the brain's more reluctant to let go of the crown than we anticipated.
Gale,Separating the crown from that monstrosity will be harder than we imagined. It might be time to reconsider our strategy.
Gale,We've a city to save. I think it's about time we got started.
Gale,"Quite the choice you're faced with: surrender the Netherstones to a mind flayer, or surrender your soul and become one."
Gale,"If you need advice, I'll do my best - though I have to say I've not much to draw on in this case. It's rather a unique predicament to have landed yourself with."
Gale,The orb? Why ever would we need to talk about that?
Gale,"I assure you it remains stable as ever, in spite of our encounter with the Netherbrain. "
Gale,"The Karsite Weave is primed for godhood, as soon as we have the Crown within our grasp."
Gale,"I stand here on the precipice of divinity - a course you encouraged me to pursue, I might add - and now you come to tell me to blow myself up?"
Gale,I'm getting rather tired of how often those I care about seem to reach the same conclusion.
Gale,Even you - after the dreams we've shared.
Gale,Pessimism like that is hardly going to improve our chances. But - I will begrudgingly admit that circumstances have somewhat changed.
Gale,"I hope your business with me isn't so contentious. I much prefer to settle matters with debate, not daggers."
Gale,I'll say one thing for our troupe - we're not short on drama. I'm glad Shadowheart and Lae'zel settled their differences peacefully. Eventually.
Gale,Even being in the presence of that amulet makes my skin crawl. It's like feeling the eyes of Bhaal himself settling upon us.
Gale,Thank goodness that's all dealt with. The odds are stacked high enough against us already. No need to turn on each other.
Gale,By figuring out his true intentions.
Gale,Fine - but my reasoning is this:
Gale,"Admittedly, it's an area in which I have a modicum of expertise. And based on the evidence before us, it's hard to imagine any other motivation."
Gale,Fact one: there's something very strange and very powerful about our tadpoles.
Gale,Fact two: a devil offers to take it away.
Gale,"So I say for now - we wait. If I'm right, Raphael will seek us out again. And when he does, there's a mighty bargain to be made."
Gale,Remember his Cormyrian rhyme? 'Down came the claw'. Perhaps we should start growing our nails.
Gale,"Now, let's drop the matter, before I feel obliged to detonate the orb just to put an end to the bloody business altogether."
Gale,Our souls. But I suspect that's but his opening offer.
Gale,There's no such thing as an absolute certainty.
Gale,"Believe me, that was a devil's equivalent of serenades and roses."
Gale,Don't let his bluster fool you. All that talk of desperation? It merely illustrates his own.
Gale,"Yes... They offer you an apple, but they're the worm that lurks within."
Gale,Still - don't let his bluster fool you. All that talk of desperation? It merely illustrates his own.
Gale,"Even feigning a mortal form it was easy to detect the whiff of sulphur about him, to spot the flicker of hellfire in his eyes."
Gale,After all he'd been through... Zevlor did not deserve such a death.
Gale,Let me play the devil's advocate: the man is too eager. Do not dismiss his offer out of hand.
Gale,"As for your current predicament - it doesn't matter to me who holds the Netherstones, so long as they they are mine to claim once the brain is dispatched. "
Gale,"Beyond that, the choice is yours to make, and I wouldn't dare to impose myself on one faced with making such a sacrifice."
Gale,Come now - turning on each other will hardly improve our chances of survival.
Gale,"Though... Mystra's eyes may be upon me, and she'd forbid me dabbling with such magic. She'd want it destroyed. Wasted, arguably."
Gale,"Deal with it how? I hate to pull rank, but I was once Mystra's Chosen. Destroying magic like this was my bread and butter."
Gale,Or did you wish to use it? I assure you - it's pointless. You'll have nothing more than a sore head and a very dissatisfied wizard to show for it.
Gale,"Oh, charming. I hope the Shadow Weave was to blame for that little outburst of unwarranted discourtesy."
Gale,"If you think you know best, go right ahead."
Gale,"Some room then, if you please."
Gale,"Not bad for a wizard who slept through his Calishite lessons, eh?"
Gale,"The discarded pixie corpses might still contain enough essence, and with one of the broken lantern casements..."
Gale,"Gods, you're obstinate."
Gale,Not how I would have done it.
Gale,"Very well. Stand back, if you please."
Gale,"I'd advise against it - in your case, at least. No disrespect intended, but this is not your typical magic."
Gale,"Well, it wasn't in his published archives - it was merely a sketch. He invoked Mystra's guidance on how to complete it. "
Gale,"It was a quite fascinating design, though the version created here is a strange corruption of the Weavepasha's original intent."
Gale,"If the path we tread were easy, there'd be a queue of fools willing to walk it. Alas, it isn't. And such grim choices must fall to us."
Gale,"I trust you to know the course we must take. But my offer stands - if none wish to shoulder the illithid's burden, the orb would achieve the same ends."
Gale,"Go ahead, then. Do your worst."
Gale,"But even so, I have the unfortunate suspicion your survival is still very much in jeopardy."
Gale,"It's inert, if that's what you mean. But it still reeks of the Shadow Weave, and its polluting magic will continue to escape for as long as it lies abandoned here."
Gale,"The sigils are written in a curious mix of tongues - ancient Calishite, Netherese, and something else I can't quite make out. If I'm reading it correctly - it was used in the creation of Moonlanterns."
Gale,"However, the sharpest tongues sometimes make the finest points. And your urgency is not unwarranted -  our circumstances have changed."
Gale,"The elder brain was already a formidable foe, but the Netherbrain is on the cusp of achieving a godhood of its own. "
Gale,"Sacrificing myself to destroy it wasn't exactly the form of immortality I hoped for, but perhaps the time for hope has passed altogether. Now we need certainty."
Gale,"So be it - I will be ready, whatever you decide."
Gale,Is that not the very nature of chasing divinity?
Gale,"Good. We'll put that little outburst down to the shock of the circumstances, and move swiftly on."
Gale,You'll soon have far greater things to be glad of - I promise you that.
Gale,"It's been mostly drained, but even now contains a powerful dose of Shadow Weave."
Gale,"As it stands, I see no option free of sacrifice in one form or another. So the question becomes - what are you willing to give up?"
Gale,"Keep the stones, and you relinquish the very essence of your being. Your soul, your emotions, your purpose. You would lose everything, and might live with such a loss for eternity."
Gale,"All I can say is - whatever choice you make, if it leads us to taking the Crown it will be worth it. And I will ensure you are well taken care of."
Gale,"Whatever you decide, do not delay for too long. Every moment we hesitate, the Crown may slip further out of reach."
Gale,"If you seek my input, you've only to ask."
Gale,"Fate seems determined to make a mindflayer of you, as it would make a cataclysm of me. Make your choice - the orb will be there regardless."
Gale,Please tell me you don't mean to jump down that... oesophagus. The thought alone makes my own jump the other way.
Gale,"A ritual circle... and a complex one, at that. I've seen such a construction before, in the writings of the Weavepasha of Almraiven, though his vision was not so... tainted."
Gale,"Relinquish the stones, and you place your fate in the hands of a creature whose trustworthiness is hardly guaranteed."
Gale,"I'm too long in the tooth to play sacrificial lamb - sacrificial bearded goat, more like. I will not just give in to the orb. Not when I've made it this far."
Gale,"Should circumstances become that dire, I will not hesitate. But I dearly hope that will not be necessary."
Gale,I'm glad. It would be more than a touch awkward if you tried and I had to turn on you.
Gale,"Brave, or stupid. I've proved myself the latter too many times where she's concerned. "
Gale,"It certainly wasn't the reunion I was hoping for. Though if anyone had to deliver such a message, I'm glad it was my old friend."
Gale,"No comment on a visit from the finest wizard in the realms, the famed Elminster of legend and lore? You are hard to impress."
Gale,"So, what did you wish to speak about?"
Gale,"I can't believe Mystra granted me an audience, and I failed to hear her out."
Gale,She won't extend that invitation twice. We'll have to figure things out ourselves from here.
Gale,[TagCinematic] 
Gale,"Oh, yes of course I can see how the hammer we didn't know existed until Raphael generously enlightened us would take precedence."
Gale,He's always struck me as the trustworthy type.
Gale,"We already know the potential that Crown possesses. We read it, written in Karsus' own hand."
Gale,"I thought you understood that, but it seems I was mistaken."
Gale,"If you'd rather put such power in the hands of a devil than in me, your trusted companion, well... that companionship might prove a rather fleeting one."
Gale,No - what we should be pursuing is knowledge. We need to learn more about that crown. 
Gale,We should pay a visit to Sorcerous Sundries. Their book collection is the envy of the Sword Coast - I'm certain the truth lurks somewhere on their shelves.
Gale,Why are you so certain we shouldn't?
Gale,"It's not a demand he wanted to make of me. As Mystra's Chosen, he had no choice but to deliver her message, however much it pained him to do so."
Gale,Of course. Kind of you to stop by.
Gale,I had no doubt I could rely on you.
Gale,"Let's save such certainty for the moment such a decision is upon us. You may feel differently, once we know what we're truly up against."
Gale,"Hint taken. We'll leave that particular fuse unlit, for now. What do you need of me?"
Gale,"Oh. Well, in that case, I suppose we'll just move on."
Gale,"I'd have hoped to introduce you to him in less dire circumstances, but those are hard to come by these days."
Gale,"The doddering act is merely an illusion, one he's most adept at maintaining. Elminster is the most formidable wizard in the realms, perhaps in existence."
Gale,A wizard doesn't reach Elminster's age without enjoying their home comforts. Those who seek danger over cheese don't tend to live as long.
Gale,For Mystra to have sent him... The severity of her bidding could not be clearer. Or weigh more heavily on me.
Gale,"Time seems so infinite when you are young... a month is an age, a year is a lifetime... it is a strange feeling, to realise how little of it one might have left."
Gale,"I'm glad to hear it. But you realise, we can't just tell him we changed our minds."
Gale,"Of course - he offered the clearest solution to our problem. All I have to do is find the right place and time, close my eyes, and let go..."
Gale,...and I along with it.
Gale,"Possibly the most spectacular one ever conceived, but essentially, yes."
Gale,"I am living on borrowed time, in more ways than one. Perhaps... perhaps this is how it must be."
Gale,"If there was, I'm sure the goddess of magic and the greatest wizard who ever lived would have identified it, but alas... only one solution is offered."
Gale,"That's the one saving grace. It seems the orb is now stable, at least until I get to where I need to be."
Gale,But that remains ahead of us for now. The Heart of the Absolute must be discovered before I can stop its beating.
Gale,Then I suppose there is nothing more to be done but find the Heart of the Absolute... and stop its beating.
Gale,"Then the slate will be clean, wrongs will be righted, the Absolute will be gone..."
Gale,"I'm sorry, and I assure you - you were never at risk. However, the cause of my condition is... complicated."
Gale,"You signed an infernal contract, not some half-baked deal on the back of a napkin. If this scheme of yours fails, the Crown of Karsus is Raphael's, whether you 'intended' it or not."
Gale,"I assure you - the hammer Raphael offered is mere scrap metal in comparison, whatever use he claims for it."
Gale,"I knew it was powerful, of course, but I could hardly analyse something trapped within my own body."
Gale,"Let me assure you - the Karsite Weave has no more inherent evil to it than a - a child in the womb, or an axe half-forged on the blacksmith's anvil."
Gale,"It is a tool, ready to be shaped by its wielder. By me. And you know me to be someone of reasonably sound moral judgement, don't you?"
Gale,"It's a wonderful feeling, to care for someone so deeply. Treasure it."
Gale,"But they didn't. I always thought it was a miracle that I survived, but I'm starting to wonder if there was more to it."
Gale,I don't think you're quite seeing what I'm seeing.
Gale,How can I not?
Gale,"Think about it - the Crown of Karsus, the Netherstones, the Karsite Weave - no more than a tadpole's breadth from being reunited."
Gale,"This is my chance to get back everything that was taken from me. Everything Mystra denied me. And once I have it, I can forge a better world. Be a better god."
Gale,I want you to help me.
Gale,I thought you more ambitious than this. I see I was mistaken.
Gale,Very well. I'll drop the matter - for now.
Gale,Well then - what more is there to discuss?
Gale,"All we need to do is stay focused on the task at hand: defeating that elder brain. After that, you can leave the rest to me."
Gale,I'm seeing exactly what's before my eyes. If you prefer to keep yours closed - that's up to you.
Gale,"Slim to none, I hope. Mystra has no right to prevent another ascending to the pantheon. Only Ao can decide that."
Gale,So do I. Though I'm not sure that's the purpose I'd apply it to.
Gale,"Evil is a reductive term, too often used to dismiss choices the observer lacks the imagination to understand."
Gale,"Of course I couldn't control it. I was mortal. But once I reforge the crown, the power of a god will be mine to command. The orb will answer to me."
Gale,So the devil himself is pursuing the crown. 
Gale,"As for whether it's truly the Crown Karsus forged? Well, I think it's safe to assume we shouldn't take anything Raphael utters at face value."
Gale,"Hearing it said out loud - yes, I fear it is true. Fate seems determined to make a sacrifice of me."
Gale,"Nor should we have signed any contracts with him, though that particular ship has already hoisted anchor and set sail with full crew and cargo..."
Gale,Please - this has gone on long enough.
Gale,"I was quite clear about the imperative nature of my request to you, and despite that  I've seen neither hair nor hind of a magic artefact."
Gale,"Already, I've allowed myself to go untreated for too long. I fear it's already too late - I've no choice but to depart this company of ours, and pray I find something for myself."
Gale,"I knew any artefact that could command an elder brain must be close to omnipotent, but for it to be the very crown Karsus forged... it verges on unbelievable."
Gale,"Unless your 'word' is an artefact infused with an unusually high concentration of Weave, it's useless to me."
Gale,Arsehole.
Gale,There's something I've been trying to tell you - I have a condition that requires me to consume potent magical artefacts.
Gale,I'm afraid my condition has escalated to the point we may be in some considerable danger. I must ask you to give me a suitable item. Immediately.
Gale,"I'm afraid my condition has worsened to the point I cannot in good conscience stay in this company of ours. I need to leave, and seek an item to consume before it's too late."
Gale,"It's my own fault. Somehow I never found the right moment, and now it's far too late."
Gale,The Karsite Weave... I had no idea. Do you realise what this means?
Gale,The orb is no stray piece of ordinary magic. It is something entirely different - the nascent form of a new divine power.
Gale,"I know what I need, and I've spent too long trusting others to find it for me. It's time I shouldered my own burden, and let you shoulder yours. May we both get what we deserve."
Gale,"Ah. Well, that's rather a long and complicated story."
Gale,"I suppose it's time we dealt with the hollyphant in the room: you have questions for me, and I promise I have answers."
Gale,An audience with Elminster is never less than memorable.
Gale,"Were I a more superstitious man, I confess I'd be inclined to see a certain divine destiny in the greatest of Karsus' creations re-emerging at the same time as one another, in the same city."
Gale,What if this is my chance? I'd be a fool not to take it...
Gale,I suppose you're right. No sense adding the all-powerful goddess of magic to our list of enemies. We've enough of those already.
Gale,Onwards to redemption then. And whatever lies beyond...
Gale,The futures unfolding for us would be infinite - impossible for me to describe. But possible for me to show you.
Gale,True enough. There's a reason such unwitting heroes have been the backbone of lyric and legend for as long as both have existed. 
Gale,"Even so - I was hardly some naive apprentice at the time. I considered myself an archmage, and yet was fool enough to be mistaken for a common conjurer."
Gale,"As always, I endeavour to be invigorated by your candour, rather than eviscerated by it."
Gale,"Blunt as your summation is - it's correct. I dared to call myself an archmage while acting the apprentice. The hallmarks of a most excellent idiot, unfortunately."
Gale,"If Mystra were here, I don't think she'd be best pleased with me for doing that."
Gale,She was always rather fond of pixies.
Gale,"Still, I'm sensing no signs of any divine retribution incoming. I'm not quite sure what to make of that."
Gale,True enough. She'd certainly not want to jeopardise the completion of this little mission she and Elminster have concocted.
Gale,"It may not be the most savoury kind of magic, but it will taste sweet enough if it brings us to the Heart of the Absolute in one piece."
Gale,We're up against the greatest threat Faerûn has ever faced. I don't mind getting my hands dirty if it gives us a better chance of surviving.
Gale,"It would be quite something to wake up in the morning without regret, and live each day knowing another will follow, like as not. "
Gale,"Well, what's a ginormous elder brain once you've grappled with your own crippling anxieties?"
Gale,Imagine - being able to picture one's life ending in something other than a cataclysmic explosion. What a treat.
Gale,"I - I don't know. It's been so long since I dared to imagine an end to the orb's hunger. I'd better start thinking about it, hadn't I?"
Gale,"As if it wasn't enough to have seen her again, she didn't exactly summon me there for small talk."
Gale,"And what you felt was but the slightest drop drawn from the rushing torrent that is the Weave. I confess, without my former prowess even I struggled to stand her presence."
Gale,The effects on the mortal body of such unfettered magical exposure cannot be overestimated. She held back in order to protect us. To make sure I heard her.
Gale,She gave us the secret of the orb's power. I'd call that extremely useful knowledge to have.
Gale,"The Karsite Weave, within me this whole time..."
Gale,"I knew the orb was no ordinary ball of magic, but for it to be Karsus' malignant creation... gods, how did I not see that?"
Gale,"What right had I to go about declaring myself an archmage, when I was as foolish as a common apprentice in setting such an entity loose?"
Gale,Refusing to compromise my morals would be rather a selfish thing given how many lives are at stake.
Gale,At least now I'm armed with the truth. And Mystra's expectations.
Gale,"It sounds like the door to redemption is open at last. All I have to do is walk through it, carrying the Crown of Karsus."
Gale,"I see few other options open to me, if I ever want to reclaim those parts of myself the orb snatched away. "
Gale,There aren't many I'd trust to stand beside me on such a journey. Fewer still who would do so because they believe I deserve such a chance.
Gale,I'll have to disagree with you there. Having not one but two parasitic entities within your body does very little for one's faith in one's personality.
Gale,I will not let you down.
Gale,"Now, I believe we've a date with an elder brain to get to. Shall we?"
Gale,Needless to say - I've work ahead of me before I'll feel myself truly redeemed of the damage I caused. But I intend to try.
Gale,"Once I bring the Crown of Karsus to her, I can put everything right. The orb too. I'll be myself again - for all that's worth."
Gale,"That's good to know. Although, I should say I do what I do out of a sense of utility and pragmatism, not a love of the unsavoury. "
Gale,"Whatever advantage I can gain for us, I will. And I refuse to feel guilty for it, no matter how much Mystra's chidings might echo in my skull."
Gale,"Quite the pair of legs you've got on you, to make that kind of leap."
Gale,I wouldn't have her any other way.
Gale,"I'd actually been thinking about introducing the two of you anyway. Over a sumptuous home-cooked meal, if that sounds at all to your taste?"
Gale,My tower in Waterdeep boasts an excellent kitchen and a wine cellar to rival Ondal himself. Not to mention a larder stocked with my homemade hundur sauce.
Gale,"A Waterdhavian delicacy, spiced to leave exactly the right amount of heat lingering on the tongue, and served with that most sharp-toothed of aquarian residents, the quipper fish."
Gale,I make it to my mother's recipe. It packs quite a wallop. As does she.
Gale,More than you could possibly believe.
Gale,"Ah, you have something more private in mind? No - don't tell me. I'll let my imagination fill in the gaps."
Gale,"That's Tara - loyal, intelligent, brave, and apparently unwilling to follow even the most basic of instructions when her own safety is at stake."
Gale,"Now that we've got something to look forward to, I think it's time we went and saved the world. Don't you?"
Gale,"I thought we'd be in Waterdeep. You, curled up before a roaring hearth while I prepared us a ridiculously extravageant meal, served with a batch of my homemade hundur sauce."
Gale,I fear mine is a dream for another life. But a fine one nonetheless.
Gale,"As for this one, I think we've still got a world to save. Unless there's anything else?"
Gale,"Gods, I love your optimism. Contagious in the most endearing way."
Gale,"I know you love me. Perhaps it was too much to expect you to love my cat as well. I mean, tressym."
Gale,"Oh, I'm sure she had her reasons."
Gale,"The Absolute should be a thing of the past, and I with it... yet at the risk of angering Mystra further, I'm glad it didn't come to that. Given what has come to light."
Gale,I always imagined what it would be like when you finally got to meet her. This wasn't quite what I pictured.
Gale,"Gods, it's refreshing to share the company of someone who sees things the same way I do."
Gale,"I agree. And on the plus side, if I get myself into any truly cataclysmic straits during the remainder of our journey, my family name will go untarnished."
Gale,Was there anything else you needed of me?
Gale,"No, Mystra wouldn't have issued an order like that if she was content for it to be ignored. She meant it. Perhaps so much so that's she's willing to overlook transgressions like this..."
Gale,Then thank goodness I have you to keep me in check.
Gale,"Now come, we'd best keep moving. We have many more shadows to face before we reach the Heart of the Absolute."
Gale,A valid and most astutely observed point. 
Gale,"It certainly seems that way, doesn't it? And I supect that suits her rather well for the time being. "
Gale,"Mystra would certainly exercise caution were she to make her presence felt in these cursed lands. But if she wanted to do so, even Shar couldn't stop her."
Gale,"No, if she's remained silent then it goes withat saying that such silence carries import of its own."
Gale,"Anything you ask, I'll answer as honestly as I can. I'm an open book, requiring only your gentle hands to turn my pages."
Gale,"So long as I have her mission ahead of me, I suspect she'll not want to distract me with any undue moralising."
Gale,"Tara remains as wilful as ever, but I'm glad you've finally made her acquaintance."
Gale,"Given the length of my time away, I feared she might have given up on me. I should have known better - she'd never do such a thing."
Gale,It's been so long since I've used it. 'Gale Dekarios' cuts a poor figure next to the wizarding prowess of 'Gale of Waterdeep.'
Gale,You like so many things about me I'd have sooner discarded... Your generosity is quite wonderful.
Gale,"Gale Dekarios likes you too. Very, very much. Though let's keep his existence between ourselves for now."
Gale,"Oh, she's happy if I'm happy. Morena couldn't care one jot what I call myself. Tara's the real stickler for using it. Has done since I summoned her."
Gale,"I'd prefer you not follow her example, if that's all the same to you. 'Gale' is more than sufficient."
Gale,I hope you're here to discuss that contract you just signed. Agreeing to give away our greatest hope of salvation wasn't the wisest of moves.
Gale,"I was supposed to sacrifice myself to stop the Absolute - yet I don't think I could have gone through with it, in truth. And I'm glad that I didn't, given what has come to light."
Gale,"I've been threatened with the sharp end of a dagger before, but never with such a monster as Orin holding the blade. "
Gale,"It certainly would have been a disappointment to spend so long resisting the instructions of my own god, only to die as the play thing of someone else's."
Gale,"The insertee we speak of, this parasite - are you aware that after a period of excruciating gestation it will turn us into mind flayers?"
Gale,"It's a process known as ceremorphosis, and let me assure you: it is to be avoided."
Gale,"So speaking about divine intervention, you don't happen to be a cleric, by any chance, do you? A doctor? Surgeon? Uncannily adroit with a knitting needle?"
Gale,"You don't happen to be a cleric, by any chance, do you? A doctor? Surgeon? Uncannily adroit with a knitting needle?"
Gale,"Most, no doubt. But I find myself hoping to be in the presence of the few. You don't happen to be one of them?"
Gale,Then it looks like we're both starved for answers.
Gale,"A cap would keep the parasite nice and cosy, but its comfort is hardly my priority."
Gale,I suppose few enough can. It's not exactly a common affliction.
Gale,"We're most certainly going to need a healer, and soon too. How about we lend each other a helping hand once more and look for a healer together?"
Gale,"Are you certain? There might be danger around the next corner, and a wizard is excellent company to keep."
Gale,Most excellent. A parasite shared is a parasite halved. Or something to that effect.
Gale,Oh! But before you think you're about to embark on a journey with most ill-mannered a man: thank you for pulling me out of that stone.
Gale,"It was an act of foresighted kindness I assure you, for I have the feeling ample opportunities will present themselves for me to return the favour."
Gale,"Oh, but I see now you're travelling with plenty of company already. Perhaps I can join you later instead."
Gale,"I'll make my way to your camp, and embark upon a succulent slow-cook to be consumed upon your return."
Gale,I don't feel right. Not even close.
Gale,Getting weaker by the moment.
Gale,Feeling more unwell than ever.
Gale,What I wouldn't give for some respite.
Gale,"Very fine drow weave indeed, if you'll excuse the pun. I can most certainly use it."
Gale,A fortunate find indeed. Allow me to take it off your hands.
Gale,It brims with Weave. It is... quite remarkable.
Gale,"A hag's magic is nothing to be scoffed at. Yes, this will suit perfectly."
Gale,Indeed. Exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for.
Gale,"Ah, a Thayan artefact. Yes, this is very promising."
Gale,Interesting workaround... though not one that can be counted on it all circumstances.
Gale,"Oh, but I've just come to realise you're not the leader of this little troupe. My joining your ranks is not your call to make, I'm afraid."
Gale,My condition's only getting worse.
Gale,"No use sugarcoating it, is there?"
Gale,Gotcha. Private. Nothing to do with me.
Gale,"And yet, if we indulge in the hypothetical for a moment..."
Gale,"As a githyanki, it's no news to you that this parasite will soon turn us into mind flayers - an outcome I'd rather like to avoid."
Gale,Struggling more with every moment.
Gale,I hope I don't deteriorate further.
Gale,"Gods, this is bloody uncomfortable."
Gale,"Back on the ship, you too were on the receiving end of a rather unwelcome insertion in the ocular region, were you not?"
Gale,"Hail your party leader, would you? I'd like to join if deemed amenable."
Gale,"Ugh, I feel rotten."
Gale,"One step in front of the other, Gale."
Gale,"Most excellent! Then without further ado, let's be off!"
Gale,"As such, I'm feeling magnanimous enough to let bygones be bygones. A healer is what we need. Shall we?"
Gale,"That said, despite my return to the land of the living my predicament remains, and so of course does yours."
Gale,"I'd thank you for bringing me back to life, but your ending it in the first place has me rather in two minds about you."
Gale,"My, I hope it has been made abundantly clear that to kill me is... counterproductive."
Gale,"Ah, my saviour! I'd be in quite a bind if not for your valiant tugging."
Gale,"Whatever you're doing, it's working wonders! Now a quick little pull should do the trick."
Gale,Here's hoping we come across a powerful healer and a powerful wizard both.
Gale,No! I can't make it out by myself. I'll perish in here!
Gale,No! I'm slipping away! I'll perish in here!
Gale,"Apologies, I didn't exactly memorise my cephalopodian banishment spells last night. Wasn't the best prepared for an attack-by-squid."
Gale,Then you leave me no choice but to answer your folly with fury.
Gale,Ten years of bad luck if you kill a wizard. Why take the risk?
Gale,"Your quite significant loss. Farewell then, and good luck."
Gale,"As we've established, few enough can. It's not exactly a common affliction."
Gale,"It is a valuable commodity, to be favoured so by the gods."
Gale,I'll perish...!
Gale,"Forged with Selûne's blessing. Yes, I can most certainly use this!"
Gale,"I'd happily accept, but you're not the leader of your little troupe, are you? Not your call to make, I'm afraid."
Gale,"You've grown none the wiser, I see."
Gale,"I'd be rather enjoying this journey, were I not wracked with pain."
Gale,"Deep breaths, Gale. Hold it together."
Gale,I'm feeling rather unsteady...
Gale,Ugh... I'm fading. I need a pick-me-up. Something with the essence of the Weave.
Gale,Ah... much better. The Weave makes me feel like a new man.
Gale,"There's a tension between us no doubt, but it's not the chemistry I took it for. I just don't like you very much. So, if you'll excuse me, I've better places to be."
Gale,"I'm afraid that goes for our relationship as well - I'll make my own way from here. Alone, again. What a disappointment."
Gale,"And I'm flattered, I'm sure - but it seems you're travelling with a substantial amount of companions already. Maybe later, yes?"
Gale,"So unless an honest effort is made on your part, I don't think we'll be travelling together much longer."
Gale,I think our relationship needs a bit of work. Or else I might need a bit of space.
Gale,"The more time we spend together, the less I feel I know you."
Gale,"Perhaps we're not as well-matched as I thought. I'm not giving up yet, but I have to warn you, I know when to walk away."
Gale,"I consider myself as open minded as the next wizard, but I have to say, I think we're beginning to lose the magic a little."
Gale,"How about we both try a little harder, yes? That - or part ways."
Gale,"Look, I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot here."
Gale,Exploration merits companionship though. Shall we?
Gale,"Listen, I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion our joint travels are destined to fail. I could say it's me, not you, but that would be a lie."
Gale,"Relieved. Drained. Proud of myself, for summoning the courage to go to her in the first place. And, if I'm being totally honest - a bit light-headed."
Gale,"A fine blade. Almost a pity to absorb it's magic, but I do so have need of it."
Gale,"From what I can gather from afar, they do seem mighty interesting."
Gale,"Harder! Come on, put your back into it!"
Gale,"Persistent, isn't it? Looks like you made a new friend for life."
Gale,The artefact claims a new owner. So much for mourning the last one.
Gale,"Looks like that box has taken a shine to you. So unconditional, isn't it, the affection of inanimate objects?"
Gale,A box that simply refuses to be toyed with. Happens to the best of us.
Gale,"Curious artefact, isn't it? Ancient, beguiling, cryptic - the ABCs of mystery. "
Gale,"That's it! Go on, keep pulling!"
Gale,"Ooft, hello. I'm Gale of Waterdeep. Apologies, I'm usually better at this."
Gale,"A bit shocked, but friend, it's a relief and a pleasure to make your acquaintance."
Gale,At magic.
Gale,"Say, but I know you, don't I? In a manner of speaking. You were on the nautiloid as well."
Gale,Then I can only assume you too were on the receiving end of a rather unwelcome insertion in the ocular region.
Gale,"I don't know what transpired exactly, but the ship broke into pieces and I suddenly found myself in freefall."
Gale,Quite. And I must say - I'm glad you've taken my plight to heart. I see my trust in you was most excellently placed.
Gale,"Yes, I was afraid you'd say that."
Gale,Just your average traveller stuck between realms. Pull me out and we'll get properly introduced.
Gale,"By Mystra's eyelids, stop! Cease, you loon! Agh! Agh!"
Gale,A hand? Anyone?
Gale,"A pity. I thought I sensed rapport, the promise of adventure, a flutter of excitement right here in my breadbasket... but perhaps it was merely indigestion."
Gale,"I'm not sure I'll ever truly recover from the embarrassment of falling for her tricks, but physically - I'm absolutely fine. Rather well rested, as a matter of fact."
Gale,"Whatever modicum of reason lurked in that warped mind of hers led her to spare me, rather than skewering my corpse over her temple door."
Gale,"She appeared to me as Elminster. Came to our camp while you were gone, telling me of a Netherese artefact he'd found. One he thought could turn the tide in our favour. "
Gale,"Part of me thought it was too good to be true, but the greater part decided to trust my old friend. I should have known it wouldn't be so easy."
Gale,"I hope we never see Orin's like again. Mind flayers and Absolutists I can handle, but she was nothing but cruelty and carnage. Another whose god should go unworshipped."
Gale,"I'm grateful that you did. Most would have abandoned me to my fate, rather than take on a Chosen of the god of Murder."
Gale,Glad to hear it. I'd rather leave that creature's memory firmly behind us. What do you need?
Gale,"But a necessary one! Scrolls of True Resurrection don't grow on trees, you know."
Gale,Listen here - we've reached the point of no return.
Gale,It is time we part ways before our enmity spills over into violence.
Gale,"No, ours was not a bond of strength but of convenience. It's outstayed its welcome."
Gale,"I'd wish you a bright future, but since you cannot escape your own company, that would be a futile gesture."
Gale,So long. It hasn't been a pleasure.
Gale,Couldn't agree more.
Gale,That much we agree upon.
Gale,The currents of Weave around these sigils are absolutely fascinating. So much to explore!
Gale,"We're not compatible, you and I - neither in thought nor in temper."
Gale,Nothing would give me greater pleasure. What's the subject of the day?
Gale,"Now, I believe adventure awaits. Or misadventure, perhaps. Shall we?"
Gale,I think I've already proven I take my secrets to the grave.
Gale,I told you how I sought to win the favour of Mystra. I did this by trying to control a form of magic only one wizard ever could.
Gale,"I am dangerous. Not because I want to be, but because of... an error I made in the past."
Gale,If I can.
Gale,To the best of my ability.
Gale,Tell you what: I will answer one question that you may have.
Gale,I apologise if that sounds thankless. It's just that some secrets simply cannot be revealed.
Gale,Only fair to warn you I've precious few answers to spare.
Gale,I failed to control it. Instead it infested me.
Gale,"That said, I assume you have some questions for me."
Gale,"My hands are still cold so that handshake will have to wait, but in the meantime: thank you!"
Gale,"My word, you did it! Ha! Oh, it's good to be alive!"
Gale,There's an air about it like a soft mist. Weave to be sure.
Gale,Moonmaiden's magic. Both beautiful and powerful indeed.
Gale,Drow magic radiates from it. And drow are masters at magic.
Gale,Silvanus is an ancient and powerful god. I'm sure the magic in that idol is... delicious.
Gale,I think you're on to something.
Gale,It's a relief to be back on beautiful Faerûn. The dreariness of the Fugue Plane oppresses one's soul so very quickly.
Gale,I can almost taste it's magic. Yes. Just the thing.
Gale,"I quite agree, but I have the unfortunate suspicion your survival is still very much in jeopardy."
Gale,"That vast, burning wreckage behind you somewhat contradicts your story, but here you stand, so who am I to argue?"
Gale,"And yet, there's too much a few answers could undo..."
Gale,"I... I suppose that after all you've done for me, I should be at least a little bit forthcoming."
Gale,I do trust you. But some things... Some things are kept in the dark for good reason.
Gale,"I did say that. And I did mean it. And I do suppose that after all you've done for me, I should be at least a little bit forthcoming.<br>"
Gale,There's no knowledge in a glimpse of darkness. My secrets are still my own.
Gale,"That's... Well, that's very kind of you. If the roles were reversed I don't know if I'd have your patience."
Gale,That makes me dangerous - even in death.
Gale,"Still, swashbuckling heroics aside, I have the unfortunate suspicion your survival is still very much in jeopardy."
Gale,"It is magic  from another time and another place. It is something that is beyond me, yet inside me."
Gale,"Because it was the truth, and the truth is a great motivator."
Gale,"You brought me back to life, and for that I'm in your debt, but we're surrounded by danger. It could happen again."
Gale,It makes me dangerous - even in death.
Gale,"As I was plummeting to certain death, I spied a glimmer quite near where I estimated my body to impact with less-than-savoury propulsion."
Gale,"Recognising this glimmer to be magical in nature, I reached out to it with a Weaving of words and found myself on the other side as it were."
Gale,How about you? How did you survive the fall?
Gale,"Fair enough. But even so, I have the unfortunate suspicion your survival is still very much in jeopardy."
Gale,"When I told you I need powerful magic to keep my condition under control, I didn't tell you why. Well, here's part of the why:"
Gale,"She even offered me greater powers, the result of some manipulation of the tadpole's psionic abilities."
Gale,"Back on mortal soil once more. I can't believe I saw her, after all this time..."
Gale,Apologies - I got rather lost in the metaphor there. Allow me to provide a map -
Gale,"No, no. I've never been more sure of anything."
Gale,I see you're still lost for words about the whole thing. No matter - what can I do for you?
Gale,I wanted to talk to you about our night together...
Gale,"Have you ever walked to the very edge of a great precipice, and shuddered at how easy it would be to step into the void?"
Gale,But you - you led me away from the edge. 
Gale,"Without your words, your touch... I fear I would have sought purpose and solace in that void. You reminded me what living can feel like."
Gale,"Well, generosity is always a noble virtue - whether it be in the streets, at the charity box, or betwixt the sheets."
Gale,"We are all sensual vessels. Illusory magic lets us sail farther, and feel more deeply."
Gale,I hope the end is much farther away than I had suspected. I hope that night meant as much to you as it did to me. And I hope we will have more time together. Together... alone.
Gale,I'll see that there is - woe betide anyone who tries to stop me.
Gale,I see.
Gale,"The dignified thing for me to say is 'No, of course not. Forthrightness before all', but honestly? Yes... I would have rather you lied."
Gale,"I'm just a man. An imperfect one, with needs, wants, and flaws by the bushel. A fragile vessel in which to place potentially world-ending power."
Gale,Perhaps it would be better to not shake such a vessel.
Gale,"Oh... well, I hope I didn't make too much of an ass of myself just now."
Gale,"Thank you, for your candour, and your company. That night was still... very special for me."
Gale,"I see. Then we should rest the topic for now, then. Perhaps the dream will yet prove true... or I will have to wake and face reality."
Gale,Was there anything else you wished to discuss?
Gale,"When I indulge impulsivity... as you know, the results can be quite catastrophic. But any path we walk together is the right one. I'm sure of that."
Gale,"Since our conversation, I'd resigned myself to my fate. Each day bore the possibility of being my last, and I accepted it."
Gale,"I'm only standing here now because I failed, to put it in rather blunt terms. Mystra is unlikely to let me try again. Yet, even in spite of that - I'm glad to have more time with you."
Gale,"Since you still have me, was there anything else on your mind?"
Gale,"I wanted to... to thank you. I was sinking into a dark place, but you reminded me there is still light in the world, if I should care to look for it."
Gale,You... you may well have prevented me from doing something very rash in the near future. I count myself lucky to call you a friend.
Gale,Careful - I may just take you up on that.
Gale,Understandable. And you won't be. Not if I can help it.
Gale,I'll see that there is indeed more to come - woe betide anyone who tries to stop me.
Gale,I'm glad to hear it. And I intend to prove myself worthy of the sentiment.
Gale,"I had hoped to have a word with you about that, in fact. Our little voyage to the stars."
Gale,"What I proposed to you was something bolder than most mortals ever have to contend with, and yet your resolve was firm."
Gale,"I wanted to see how you felt, on terra prima. Did our dream survive the waking from it?"
Gale,Then my sore arms thank you - I can finally stop pinching myself.
Gale,"I can't tell you how glad I am not to face such an undertaking alone. We will succeed where Karsus failed, I'm sure of it."
Gale,"Standing side-by-side, even against such intimidating odds - how could we not?"
Gale,"You know me too well. I'm second-guessing things, as usual."
Gale,"I hope the city doesn't seem too small and quaint to you, now you've caught a glimpse of what lies above and beyond..."
Gale,"I suppose one might say I'm rather adrift, to be honest. "
Gale,"Yes... yes we do. And perhaps the sooner it's done, the better."
Gale,"Besides, given my propensity towards verbosity, it surely can't be a surprise that I have a practised tongue."
Gale,I suppose I invited that caution I hear in your voice. And I will do my best to ease any lingering misgivings.
Gale,"The highest ambition I harbour now is to see you smile, always."
Gale,True. Perhaps my notions leaned too optimistic. I would not wish Karsus' past to become my future. Not while I have you.
Gale,"We really ought to go speak to Elminster. If not out of curiosity, then at least to make sure he doesn't eat his way through all of our supplies."
Gale,"My condition is worsening again. I need to consume some powerful magic, or it may become volatile."
Gale,"It's Astarion, isn't it? I've felt the tension between you. I told myself it was casual, not a matter of the heart... but clearly I was wrong."
Gale,You two have grown closer than I thought possible. And it looks like I'm the last to know.
Gale,"I... I thought you would show me the respect of telling me first, but no matter. You can tell me now - who is it to be? Me, or him?"
Gale,"I see. Well, I suppose he does have a certain charm about him. If you're into that sort of thing."
Gale,I'll just put my feelings to one side. I think that's best for everyone. It's certainly the best thing for me.
Gale,"I won't leave - not unless you want me to, or until fate forces my hand. If your friendship is all we have, then I will be happy to have it. Eventually."
Gale,And I am lucky to have met you... my friend.
Gale,I could no more hate you than I could go without air.
Gale,"I'm sorry, but to know I had less than the whole of your heart - I can't do it. Not when I would give all of myself to you."
Gale,"Call me greedy, stubborn, old-fashioned... but I cannot change who I am, or how I love. "
Gale,"I don't deserve you, truly. But I will do my utmost to earn the right."
Gale,"What divine calculus plucked each of us from the ether, and thrust us together?"
Gale,I hope you don't think less of me. Great ambition should not come at the expense of what you already hold dear. I see that now.
Gale,Neither have I - the closest thing to a deserving canvas on which to place your beauty. But I've also not forgotten why I took you there.
Gale,"Indeed. I'll guard my resolve like a lit flame in a... well, in a gale."
Gale,I had been hoping you'd say that. To be an object of pity... I couldn't live with that.
Gale,"No crutch - I can stand tall now, thanks to you. You've renewed my taste for living. I will not be a burden to you."
Gale,"Indeed, most practical of you... I can only hope you did not find it an unpleasant endeavour."
Gale,Very well.
Gale,"It's quite thrilling, to fight off such grim creatures as this region throws at us. Especially being at your side."
Gale,I once read a book that explained in some detail the effect a brush with danger has on one's desire for... other forms of stimulation.
Gale,"I see. Well, at least it was a night to remember... for one of us. I'll trouble you no more on the matter."
Gale,Have you ever read anything on that subject?
Gale,"Perhaps it's just the thrill of our near-undead experience talking. But standing at your side through such darkness and disrepair, it only makes me want you more."
Gale,"Unfortunately this is neither the time nor place to indulge such feelings. So, we must be patient and push all such thoughts aside. For now."
Gale,"I believe you. You never look so beautiful as at the end of a stirring battle, your cheeks flushed, gaze bright, muscles glistening..."
Gale,"I can't imagine anywhere that could turn my heart from you, cursed or otherwise. You'd always be as beautiful, and as impressive."
Gale,"You have? Then I might suggest we pool our knowledge. No sense in letting valuable first-hand experience go to waste, after all."
Gale,Of course. Such distractions are hardly the most important thing to discuss at present.
Gale,My love. I hope you enjoyed our voyage through the cosmos? I was hoping you might have a moment to talk about it...
Gale,Only that I find you quite irresistible. Even illuminated by such rotten light as this place produces.
Gale,"I was hoping to speak to you, as a matter of fact. About the night you were kind enough to keep this melancholy wizard company..."
Gale,Both of us have been blessed with a new dawn - you should feel no shame at the nature of yours. And mine...
Gale,"I'm not normally one to rise with the birds myself, but something disturbed my sleep."
Gale,"I'm here for your godhood, Mystra. I'm going to rule the Weave."
Gale,"The Weave is a highly sensitive magical network threaded through all life on this plane. Any shift in magical energy, no matter how small, is akin to a beacon, alerting Mystra to its cause. "
Gale, Mindflayer!<br>
Gale,At least he got what he deserved (had his head exploded by the brain OR been killed by us directly.<br>
Gale,"I think Elminster's last message was the one carrying the punishment. Having respectfully declined it, I think she's willing to negotiate."
Gale,"It's curious. After all the wonders and monstrosities we've witnessed, waking beside you seems more unreal than any of it."
Gale,"I'd forgotten what it felt like, to greet a sunrise without fear of it being my last."
Gale,"Oh, hells. I'm sorry. Barely awake a moment and I've already put my foot in it."
Gale,Come now - resignation doesn't suit you half as well as optimism. We'll find some other means of fixing up that infernal engine of yours.
Gale,You always find a smile where others would soak in their sorrows. And I promise - you'll have reason to smile soon enough.
Gale,"When we get to Waterdeep, we'll search in my library. It's bound to contain the odd scroll on hellish thermodynamics. Or a spell that might diffuse the heat in such a way that -"
Gale,"Ah. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Do you... that is, would you consider returning to Waterdeep with me?"
Gale,"What, then? You intend to die here? Now?"
Gale,What if... what if I went with you?
Gale,"I deserve the chance to live my life with the raging inferno I love. If that means relocating to the hells, so be it. I've heard Avernus is quite lovely this time of year."
Gale,"I want you back, Mystra. I want us to be lovers again."
Gale,"I want to be your Chosen once more. And this time, I won't let you down."
Gale,I only wanted to make things right. We need never see each other again.
Gale,I crave nothing more. Take me to Elysium.
Gale,"That said, should the worst transpire, and we seem destined to fail... well, the orb remains an option. But I truly hope it does not come to that."
Gale,"I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Should the worst transpire, and we seem destined to fail... well, the orb remains an option. But I truly hope it does not come to that."
Gale,The brain... it's high above the city now - far away from any innocents.
Gale,The Absolute cannot be resisted.
Gale,After you.
Gale,"Mystra's many things, but she's no censor. Her job is not to judge those who use the Weave, but to ensure it is protected."
Gale,"Whatever she has to say, I want to hear it. Only then will we know the truth of what lies ahead."
Gale,"Besides, it would be quite something to study infernal magic in its natural environs. I say 'natural' in the loosest sense, of course."
Gale,"No, Karlach. Stay with me, please. We've shared too much to part like this.<br>"
Gale,"Let's not get too ahead of ourselves. For now, I'm just a regular wizard holding the blueprint for greatness."
Gale,"Mystra knows I've read Karsus' designs, I'm certain of that. And it clearly has her shaken."
Gale,"I came to surrender them. The Crown, the Karsite Weave - take it all."
Gale,"Thank you, but no. I have someone waiting for me."
Gale,"Perhaps one day, but for now there is more I need to accomplish."
Gale,Being an illithid has its advantages. I'm content as I am.
Gale,I'll consider your offer. Thank you.
Gale,"Very well, but it does not serve us to tarry when a summons from the heavens is waiting."
Gale,It's taken me long enough to find you. I'll be damned if I'm letting you go.
Gale,"If this is the end, then we face it together. That, at least, I can promise you."
Gale,I know that look. It's your heart isn't it? Not to worry - you have one of the finest wizards in the Realms at your fingertips.
Gale,"I promise we'll make it work, if you'll have me?"
Gale,"Then I go where you go. Waterdeep wouldn't be home without you, anyway."
Gale,"We'll need time to make the arrangements, of course. The catering alone will need to be quite extraordinary..."
Gale,But that's all to come.
Gale,"We'll need time to make the arrangements of course - the Dekarios clan is scattered clan far and wide, and you'll have invites of your own to send out, I'm sure."
Gale,"You will? Oh, thank goodness for that."
Gale,"You can't blame a fellow for trying. If you're contented as we are, then so am I."
Gale,Your 'present condition' is that you're the one I love. And your current form is merely a reflection of the depths of your sacrifice. It only makes me love you more.
Gale,That does lead me to a more pressing matter. Exactly how large is your library?
Gale,"I understand your purpose lies here, but I fear if I return to Waterdeep alone, my heart would remain here with you. "
Gale,"And so, if you're at all amenable to the idea, I thought I could, perhaps, stay. There might even be room for two Dekarioses in Baldur's Gate?"
Gale,"It does, doesn't it?"
Gale,"I see. Well, I've no desire to stand in the way of the future you've chosen."
Gale,"If our love ends here, it was no less perfect for its brevity. I will remember it, and you, always."
Gale,I think we'll have plenty of time to do just that.
Gale,"Not a morning person, I take it? I can scratch that from the list of wonderfully ordinary things I've still to learn about you."
Gale,"There remains only one matter to be resolved - for me, at least."
Gale,"In any case, know that I harbour no ill-will. I would rather see you happy with another, than not happy at all."
Gale,"I suppose I am. Tara would be delighted. Not to mention my mother. But I'd be just as happy without such ceremony, so long as we're together."
Gale,"I love you, more than I've ever loved anyone, mortal or immortal. And you've proven your love for me in more ways than even the greatest mathematicians would dare to count. "
Gale,"Soon, I'll deliver the crown to Mystra, and be rid of the orb at long last. I'll be free."
Gale,"Oh, him. I've been thinking a lot about that. 'Gale of Waterdeep', sounds a bit... pompous, don't you think?"
Gale,"We have all the time in the world for that. But first, there's something I wanted to talk to you about."
Gale,"I do feel like a new man. I was going to speak to you about that, as a matter of fact."
Gale,Whatever for? I rather like this new you.
Gale,"In fact, your tentacular transformation has inspired me to make a little change of my own."
Gale,"I hesitate to say it, but I think it's... satisfied. "
Gale,"That being said, I wondered if you might consider accompanying me back to Waterdeep as a new member of the Dekarios clan?"
Gale,"I'll need to keep a careful study of it, make sure it's not suddenly destabilised by proximity to a rogue pair of Netherese sandals or what have you, but I think it's dormant."
Gale,"It could be. Or perhaps the orb's hunger was fuelled by my own, and my contentment influences it in much the same way."
Gale,"That's how I feel with you - content. It's a rather unfamiliar feeling, I must say. Not something Gale of Waterdeep ever craved."
Gale,"I've decided to drop this whole 'Gale of Waterdeep' business. It's a bit... pompous, don't you think?"
Gale,"Quite. Though on the subject of our future plans, there was something I wanted to discuss with you."
Gale,"I thought I might take this opportunity to reinvent myself. Or uninvent myself, to be more accurate."
Gale,You're now in the company of plain old Gale Dekarios - a most brilliant wizard of intentionally limited renown. At your service.
Gale,"Now, I believe this is the moment where I should get to my point, so to speak. "
Gale,"That's one worry I can leave behind me, at least."
Gale,"Perhaps I should have done more. Been more charming, more flattering, harder to reach... but I was only myself, and sometimes that isn't enough."
Gale,"Whatever your decision, I will accept it. But you must choose. You cannot have us both."
Gale,"You would sacrifice what you have with Lae'zel, for me? She will not be pleased... "
Gale,"A shame. This is a journey I'd have liked to see through to the end, but I've my own finale to face. And it's best I face it alone."
Gale,"It's too late for that, I'm afraid. My condition has shifted somehow - its hunger for the Weave can no longer be satisfied."
Gale,Don't tempt me.
Gale,"Ah, I'm glad you've a moment for me."
Gale,"My predicament has become rather urgent. I need a magical artefact to consume, right now."
Gale,"It is Wyll, yes? The connection is palpable - no tadpole required."
Gale,He is a good man - I will not hesitate to say so. But I had hoped I was a good man also. And a worthy one.
Gale,"Not for me to stand in your way, then. You two will make a fine couple... I can picture it already."
Gale,I'm not sure Wyll's family would appreciate their heir apparent being forced to share.
Gale,"It's Shadowheart, isn't it? For one who guards her secrets so closely, she's made no attempt at hiding how much she wants you."
Gale,"Shadowheart doesn't seem the type to share her toys, never mind her lovers. Neither am I."
Gale,Did you feel that? 
Gale,"If I wasn't surrounded on all sides by the darkness of the shadow-cursed lands, I'd think it was Mystra herself brushing against my skin."
Gale,"That's Mystra's power for you. Where there's even a trace of magic, she will be there to bring it to life."
Gale,"There's clearly some magic in you, if you were able to sense her presence. But I think I felt something stronger."
Gale,"Oh, I wouldn't say that. Just a man who's been living with the consequences of his actions for a tad too long."
Gale,"It would be selfish of me to stay, when in doing so I'd be putting you, and everyone else within spitting distance in catastrophic peril."
Gale,I'm afraid this is where we part ways - my condition's deteriorated beyond even my capacity to salvage.
Gale,"I cannot keep throwing myself headlong into such danger while I am so unstable. If it my condition is not treated soon, I will be compelled to leave."
Gale,"That goddess of magic was reborn as Mystra. She ruled on, while Netherese magic was reduced to mere fragments of what Karsus once wielded - artefacts, the most powerful of which appears to be his Crown."
Gale,"And since when have we sought to avoid trouble, eh? Come now, the knowledge lurking between those pages could help us greatly. Don't be a hindrance after being such a great help."
Gale,Then we ought to make time. This could be the answer to everything.
Gale,"I hope you're right, because if you're wrong, there's no words to describe the opportunity you'll have squandered."
Gale,"Your cheeks are flush, there's a twinkle in your eye... but I think I am no longer the cause."
Gale,"It seems you've found your heart's desire, but with someone else. And who would I be, to stand in the way of such a union?"
Gale,"I assume you didn't come here to seek my blessing, though. Was there something else you needed?"
Gale,"She's left some tiny part of herself to watch over me, I think. A boon to help us reach the Heart of the Absolute in one piece."
Gale,"Lae'zel. I could scarcely believe it at first, but I've seen the glances you share, the way you lean into each other's whispers. There is something between you two. "
Gale,"If that is what will make you happy... well, I am not the one who would stand in your way."
Gale,We'll have to disagree on that score - competing against a githyanki warrior would be very poor for my health. 
Gale,"Don't worry, I know Minthara insisted on you abandoning me. Or at least I assume I'm 'the wizard' she was referring to."
Gale,"I'm happy to stay as your friend, for as long as you'll have me. Though I'll keep a safe distance from your new lover, if that's all the same to you. Now, did you seek me out for a reason?"
Gale,"Whatever lurks in the darkness ahead, I can hardly face it in my present condition. I need my full strength to stand against such shadows."
Gale,"We've already found enough magic to soothe its disquiet, if you'll just give me what I need."
Gale,"I trust you'll treat the matter with the appropriate exigency. The moment we find a suitable item, please - give it to me."
Gale,"To seek the heart of a githyanki warrior takes a good deal of courage. I can only think what you share must be quite serious, to brave such a task."
Gale,"True enough, and somehow I doubt that's an order Mystra will be willing to rescind, no matter how many times I impress her. The stakes are simply too high."
Gale,"Strange, though, that she would reward me for such a service now. She's hardly been forthcoming on that front since my banishment..."
Gale,Perhaps I'm overthinking things. A blessing's a blessing. And this one should come in most useful.
Gale,"I know what nearly happened... and I'm sorry, for putting you in that position. But I've stepped back from the precipice now. I've seen what may prove to be another way. A better way."
Gale,That crown sits on a gargantuan elder brain bent on destroying us and everything we hold dear. Understanding its true nature might unlock the means of our victory.
Gale,We need to learn more about what we saw. An artefact as powerful as that crown must have been documented somewhere. 
Gale,Sorcerous Sundries is no mere trading post. It's been serving the arcane community for centuries.
Gale,"As luck would have it, we'll soon find ourselves near one of the finest book collections this side of Candlekeep - Sorcerous Sundries. I need to go there, and learn all I can."
Gale,Ha! Sorcerous Sundries is no mere trading post. It's been serving the arcane community for centuries.
Gale,"Their collection of rare tomes is unparallelled. Netherese texts are hardly commonplace, but I'm certain they'll have one or two stashed away."
Gale,"I can't fathom how such a wonder survived - surely everything of its ilk was destroyed along with Netheril itself... but no matter. It exists, and I must learn more of it. "
Gale,"I doubt they'll have any books on breaking contracts with devils, though. We'll have to figure that one out for ourselves."
Gale,"Indeed, the journey awaits. One foot in front of the other is tried and true, I find."
Gale,The only kind I have.
Gale,"No...? My needs are modest, but the fruits they could be may prove immense. I can only hope you have a change of heart when the time comes."
Gale,"After all, a brief expedition into the bookshelves of Sorcerous Sundries is a small price to pay to save an entire city. Even if you aren't a fan of reading."
Gale,"Likely not. If I've done damage to your opinion of me, then I am truly sorry. But if this crown amounts to what I suspect it is, then your faith will soon be restored, and then some."
Gale,"It's clear crown and brain are intrinsically connected, and given the pressing urgency of us smiting the latter, understanding the former could make all the difference."
Gale,Hardly - I'm more than glad to leave that place behind.
Gale,"You'll have to forgive my eagerness, but if my suspicions prove to hold water, this could be the answer to all our problems."
Gale,Only she used the last of her power to block him from the Weave. His magic faltered. The great flying cities of Netheril plunged from the sky. Karsus' Folly.
Gale,Most Netherese artefacts contain only the faintest amount of their former power - the ghost of an echo of a memory... that crown was different.
Gale,"The elder brain. But more importantly, the crown that it wore. Even without seeing it for myself, I could sense it."
Gale,"To detonate the orb, you mean?"
Gale,You might be onto something there. Though Mystra's intelligent enough not to resort to such overt manipulation.
Gale,I'd no idea you were so insensitive.
Gale,"No, don't feel disheartened. Very few are capable of attuning themselves to what I just experienced. A state of affairs Mystra prefers, in all honesty."
Gale,"Pleasant as that would undoubtedly be, it was no lover's caress I just felt."
Gale,The curse that afflicts the land appears to be a manifestation of an incredible amount of dark magic - the sort manifested through the Shadow Weave.
Gale,"It is an altogether different form of magic, drawn from the negative spaces left in the Weave's wake. It is Shar's domain, not Mystra's."
Gale,Netherese magic. So pure - so complete - that I doubted what I was feeling at first.
Gale,"I'm surprised she would risk making contact here, however briefly."
Gale,"For her to risk coming here, however tentatively, means she came with good reason. Because of what she asked of me."
Gale,"Not weak, but subtle. Mystra knows it is a risk to make herself known here, however briefly."
Gale,"After all, this cursed place is not hers but Shar's. Mystra came here with a purpose."
Gale,"I can't help but feel like I've been fumbling in the dark for too long, and have just had a lit torch thrust into my hands."
Gale,The crown. The one the elder brain was wearing. The one I very nearly destroyed.
Gale,Netherese magic. So pure - so complete - that I didn't even recognise it at first...
Gale,The crown. The one the elder brain was wearing.
Gale,Mystra and Shar have a rather tense relationship at the best of times. It's best for everyone when they stay out of each others' domains.
Gale,I speak of what we discovered at the heart of this cursed place.
Gale,Karsus. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.
Gale,"Well, there'd be risk in such an endeavour, but only proportionate to the reward."
Gale,"If I cannot remain stable... well, let's hope it doesn't come to that. I'd hate to cut our acquaintance short, shall we say?"
Gale,Do you need anything else of me?
Gale,"I'm afraid it remains mine. But there is still time yet. Just remember what I ask - it's a small price, for what I hope I bring to our company."
Gale,I'd sooner we set our course together than deprive you of my company sooner than the fates might otherwise have decreed. It's really up to you.
Gale,My condition likes being ignored as little as I do. I must consume another artefact. And soon.
Gale,"If the crown atop the elder brain was truly forged by Karsus himself, this book will confirm it. All we have to do is turn the page..."
Gale,"The truth of the crown, I hope. All that stands between us and enlightenment is the turn of a page..."
Gale,"If my suspicions are correct, the crown currently perched atop the elder brain may be one of Karsus' design. And now we hold the very tome that could confirm it."
Gale,That devil Raphael was telling the truth. There's no doubt - the Crown of Karsus is what's controlling the elder brain.
Gale,And this - this is no mere journal - it contains Karsus' original plans for the Crown's construction. His designs for godhood.
Gale,"Not exactly. It was what he did with it that sealed his fate, and for a time, that of magic itself. The Crown was merely the means."
Gale,"Gods have ascended through far stranger means - a circle drawn on a globe, a walk in a swamp, the destruction of a magical stone. Why not with a symbol of such innate authority?"
Gale,Not from scratch - unless you happen to have several pounds of the purest Netherese metals in that pack of yours?
Gale,Don't worry - I'm not asking you to surrender anything else on my account. What's called for here is something altogether different.
Gale,I haven't the foggiest. No doubt through some nefarious means - the crown's existence had been consigned to legend centuries ago.
Gale,"You have my thanks, though unless we find a treatment soon, you won't have my full strength."
Gale,"My condition is not overly fussy. So long as there is sufficient power in the item, it will be satisfied."
Gale,We've already found something of sufficient potency. Please - give it to me.
Gale,"I... I thought you would show me the respect of telling me first, but no matter. You can tell me now - who is it to be? Me, or her?"
Gale,"I think you're right. Not one to let emotions get in the way, I'd say."
Gale,"I'm sure it would never come to that. A clip round the ear perhaps, but nothing you can't handle."
Gale,"And what of Karlach? Her heart can surely break, though it burns."
Gale,"But what of Wyll? He's a born romantic, just as I am. To lose you could kill him..."
Gale,"You're right. And broken hearts mend, in time. I'm living proof of that."
Gale,I'm sure he'll take it with grace. Or at least pretend to.
Gale,And what of Astarion? I fear you are one of the things that keeps his darkest impulses at bay.
Gale,"The book states that the Crown and Netherstones were originally one construct, seemingly sundered at the moment of Karsus' downfall."
Gale,You are right. And your heart should not be the price of his redemption. He must earn that for himself.
Gale,"And he will be grateful for it. I'm sure. Your friendship is a blessing for anyone, though I'm glad our bond is becoming something more."
Gale,Don't apologise. You must not deny your heart's desire. I would not want you to.
Gale,And what of Shadowheart? It took a lot for her to open her heart to you. She'll not exactly be pleased if you decide to break it for her...
Gale,"And she will be grateful for it. I'm sure. Your friendship is a blessing for anyone, though I'm glad our bond is becoming something more."
Gale,I'd normally be buoyed by the sight of so many friendly faces. I fear they'd be far less welcoming if they know of my condition.
Gale,We must find a suitable artefact urgently.
Gale,"Karlach, yes? You burn for each other in more ways than one."
Gale,"I am beyond lucky to have you. Sometimes even the power of the Weave seems mundane, compared to how you make me feel."
Gale,A situation I suggest we remedy with the utmost urgency.
Gale,"I promise you - the power such an item would give us is worth transcending all nine Hells for. The heavens too, while we're at it."
Gale,"To every end you can imagine, and a thousand more beyond."
Gale,"Thank you for letting me read this. At least we can face our enemy armed with the knowledge of its true nature. And of the stakes, should we fail to defeat it. <br>"
Gale,That's all I ask.
Gale,"I didn't mean that as a slight. I cherish our adventures, but even if we prevail, you must know the end is in sight, mustn't you?"
Gale,"This is no passing whim, trust me. If I can obtain that crown, it will affect us all. It is not a decision I'll take lightly."
Gale,It's our future that I'm thinking of - we can't rely on anyone else to do it for us.
Gale,For now - we've learned all we can.
Gale,That tome proved to be even more valuable than I ever could have imagined. For both of us.
Gale,"At least we can face our enemy armed with the knowledge of its true nature. And of the stakes, should we fail to defeat it."
Gale,Here's your tome back. It proved to be even more valuable than I ever could have imagined. For both of us.
Gale,Do you think I had not considered that? I have no intention of repeating his folly.
Gale,"Not until this moment, but I can't help beginning to see such a destiny unfold before me."
Gale,Perhaps they deserve to be challenged. Perhaps you and I deserve better than to live and die as their pawns.
Gale,She sent me to die.
Gale,Ambition is not a sin. To question the powers that rule us is not treason. We must at least try - why wallow in the dirt when we can reach for the stars?
Gale,I don't know. Ao does not look kindly on gods meddling in mortal affairs - she may have no choice but to stand by and let events unfold.
Gale,Then you're already wiser than me. That's a lesson I've only recently learned.
Gale,"I'm glad you can recognise this for the opportunity it is. Nevertheless, it is not a step to take lightly."
Gale,Karsus - I believe I mentioned him before. The child-who-would-become-a-god. He was the most powerful wizard ever known... and he attempted to unseat the goddess of magic herself.
Gale,"It gives me some courage, to think that you see greatness in me. I hope I live up to your expectations."
Gale,Of course it's dangerous - but that's hardly a unique quality when it comes to the purposes we've pursued together.
Gale,"Just think of it... the power of the gods in mortal hands at last. We'd be free of doctrine and dogma, confined only by the limits of our imaginations."
Gale,I can hardly wait.
Gale,"Afraid not. What I have to show you requires us to be its only witness, and our minds to share in the most exquisite concentration."
Gale,Please - don't be too hasty about this. It would be a pity to reach that conclusion without a true understanding of what this could mean for us.
Gale,Don't worry - your patience will be amply rewarded.
Gale,"Some gods may delude themselves into believing they care about their worshippers, but when it comes down to it - we're all expendable. Children to be appeased, not respected."
Gale,"I worshipped Mystra loyally for years, and in that time she granted me the barest sliver of the power I was ready to wield. "
Gale,Regardless - you've made your point. I shall put thoughts of the crown aside for the time being.
Gale,"Neither of us can know what truly may be if we don't at least try. Potential is nothing in itself - just a fleeting dream, unless we drag it into the waking world. Please, at least think on it."
Gale,"I know Mystra - intimately. And I carry a fragment of the Weave itself within my body. Karsus achieved many things, but he never managed that."
Gale,A long road lies ahead before the Crown comes into our possession. All I ask for now is that you not dismiss this possibility out of hand. Please - at least think on it.
Gale,I see. I suppose I am asking you to take a leap of faith even the most loyal of companions might struggle to land gracefully.
Gale,"I've spent so long feeling... inferior, shut out from my destiny over such a simple act of youthful enthusiasm."
Gale,"Perhaps I got carried away with the thought this Crown could give me back what Mystra took. Cure me, even."
Gale,"You're right. There aren't many wizards who'd care to be mentioned in the same breath as him, or his folly."
Gale,"Very well then - I will try my utmost to share in your optimism. Nothing wrong with a little hope, after all."
Gale,"Powerful as he was, Karsus lacked some advantages I can lay claim to."
Gale,"I can't deny my curiosity, but as you say - no harm in delaying it, for now at least."
Gale,"Barely awake a moment, and the prince of the githyanki demands you surrender your soul?"
Gale,"I suppose you're right - we still see only a part of the picture, however much our visitor claims to show the full vista of options at our disposal."
Gale,"A word of advice - wizards' towers can be volatile places. They keep their secrets buried, and their dangers close to the surface."
Gale,"A wizard's tower. Familiar territory for you as it is for me, no doubt. Imposing places, hiding their secrets well."
Gale,"Always a pleasure to share a moment with you, if not in the way I once envisioned. What do you need of me?"
Gale,The Karsite Weave.
Gale,I think your new form rather suits you. It has a certain... cephalopodic charm to it. A tentacular tingle.
Gale,The Weave.
Gale,A simple movement charm wouldn't be too hard to apply to such an object. I could conjure one up for you if you like?
Gale,Kill or be killed - so it goes down in the Underdark.
Gale,Anything I can do for you - consider it most enthusiastically done.
Gale,"Very well then. Once the city is saved, Karlach's Kinetic Cleaver will be first on my list."
Gale,"Whoa, not so fast. Let's get the lay of the land before we settle on the scorched earth routine."
Gale,"There's the matter of the gnomes, too. Wouldn't do to stand by and keep them enslaved."
Gale,"Whatever you need, you have only to ask."
Gale,Unless there's something more pressing you wish to discuss?
Gale,"It doesn't do to keep a wizard waiting, especially one of Elminster's reputation. Not to mention appetite. We should join him in camp at the first opportunity."
Gale,"Much as I enjoy our conversations, I think it's Elminster we should be catching up with. "
Gale,Tell me - what can I do for you? 
Gale,I do enjoy our conversations. What do you need?
Gale,Always a delight to speak with you. What can I do?
Gale,What do you need?
Gale,You need something of me?
Gale,Yes. What is it?
Gale,"This is hardly the time for idle banter. The Annals of Karsus are here, waiting to be read..."
Gale,Look at those uniforms. They must have belonged to some kind of sect.
Gale,My time is yours. What do you need?
Gale,"So we must save the drow first, then sever his head after... Pleasantries like that make me quite homesick."
Gale,"She really oozes charm, this one. Perhaps we should spare a thought for the wretches she's enslaved."
Gale,Uhm - I think you might be about to bite off more duergar than you can chew.
Gale,You need me?
Gale,What is it?
Gale,Did you need something?
Gale,"Yes, my love?"
Gale,"Are you all right? If you have need me, just say the word."
Gale,The gnomes should be able to go where they please. They are not the duergar's to keep.
Gale,Brittle are the foundations upon which the houses of tyrants are built. It seems I judged you to be less brittle than you really are.
Gale,Is something on your mind? You can always unburden yourself with me.
Gale,Wyll would make for a dashing prince in many a romantic tale... and yet you turned to the book of Gale.
Gale,"Hmmm, that name doesn't ring a bell."
Gale,Karsus.
Gale,"Apologies - I am a babbling brook of romantic verbage. Consider my mouth sealed... until you have use for it, of course."
Gale,"A cruel conclusion to the mercy we showed, but hardly an unpredictable one. As long as it lives, so will its appetite."
Gale,We were warned about the curse. Can't say I fancy our chances without a Moonlantern.
Gale,A stab in the dark it is...
Gale,My thoughts exactly.
Gale,'Death-dark' doesn't sound very inviting. Can't say I fancy our chances without freeing Nere and getting that Moonlantern.
Gale,"The best cure for doubt is study and experimentation. And an experiment must be repeated thrice in order to ensure accuracy, of course."
Gale,Then I'm glad to have met your standards. And intend to prove your appraisal more than correct.
Gale,"I must admit I am surprised - not to mention flattered, elated, and a little frightened. Such stiff competition... and yet you chose me."
Gale,I thought perhaps Karlach had won your heart. To say she is a strong woman is an understatement for the ages...
Gale,The crown.
Gale,"I thought Lae'zel was sure to lay claim to you. Hazardous perhaps, to deny her..."
Gale,"I'm sure whatever's on your mind poses no such risk, but caution is to be advised. Now, what can I do for you?"
Gale,"Let's not get into another scrape, shall we? Still catching my breath after the last one."
Gale,"Down here in the Underdark, few dangers ever truly die."
Gale,"Moonrise. We're getting close to the lion's den - and plenty of questions I have for the lion, too."
Gale,"Still, if whatever managed to murder a group of Sharrans is still around, we had better watch our step."
Gale,"Whatever it was that killed them, if it managed to murder a group of Sharrans, we had better watch our step."
Gale,"There's room for adventure, but no room for me it seems. You have your fair share of followers already."
Gale,The choice is yours. There's really no good decision to be made here.
Gale,She's a pregnant lady in distress. We can't just stand by and pretend she's not here.
Gale,"I'll be in the camp then, idling away the hours."
Gale,"I'll be here in the meantime, idling away the hours."
Gale,"I question the wisdom of that decision, but so be it."
Gale,"That was a rather unimpressive display of pettiness, if you ask me."
Gale,"Allow me to apologise on Astarion's behalf, sir. His lack of tact is a burden to us all."
Gale,"Allow me to apologise on Shadowheart's behalf, sir. Her lack of tact is a burden to us all."
Gale,"Allow me to apologise on Lae'zel's behalf, sir. Her lack of tact is a burden to us all.<br>"
Gale,I wasn't sure if we'd lose you to that darkness entirely. I'm glad to know you've found your way back to us.
Gale,"A wizard's tower is his sanctum, a private place for research and respite. But as this wizard's not home - I say we take a peek."
Gale,Nothing like ridding oneself of a god's unwanted influence to lighten the load on your shoulders.
Gale,"What's done is done, I suppose. But I'd be loathe to cause such destruction again. Not unless the alternative is far, far worse."
Gale,"Can't say that it did. I'm not entirely sure we made the right decision there, if I'm being honest with you."
Gale,Beggars can't be choosers. Such a powerful form should serve us well in the chaos to come.
Gale,"It's certainly one of the more unsightly shape-shiftings I've seen, but we can't all be blessed with the elegance of an aasimar transforming in the heavens, can we?"
Gale,"Honestly, I didn't know you had it in you. A dark destroyer in our midsts."
Gale,"I can hardly hold you responsible for what you do while unconscious, but still... I'll sleep with one eye open. Better safe than, well, dead."
Gale,I'm sure that will be of small comfort to her.
Gale,"As regards to your own morbid little fantasies, I'm sure they're nothing to worry about. So long as they remain fantasies."
Gale,We all have those from time to time. 
Gale,"If ceremorphosis takes place, all trace of your former self will be subsumed into the mind flayer's hive. So, to still be here, if a mite forgetful? Still a win in my book."
Gale,"Then again, our case isn't exactly usual. Perhaps whatever's causing our tadpoles to remain in stasis has also affected your mind. "
Gale,A Bhaalspawn? Gosh.
Gale,Ingenious use of the magic in the tower's floral core. Though not ingenius enough to outsmart Gale of Waterdeep.
Gale,"Don't get me wrong. I love poetry as much as the next wizard, but using it to command an automaton... seems a bit self-indulgent to me."
Gale,"If we're to help Thulla, we'll have to breach that wall with explosives and hope the blast doesn't injure anyone. Or worse."
Gale,"Let's not. But a word of warning: down here in the Underdark, few dangers ever truly die."
Gale,"Maybe. But if whatever managed to murder a group of Sharrans is still around, we had better watch our step."
Gale,"Don't turn on each other. If whatever managed to murder a group of Sharrans is still around, we had better watch our step."
Gale,"Did you expect I wouldn't hear about you sharing your affections with somebody else? If you had doubts about us, you should have talked to me."
Gale,"Ooft, you are a very Cone of Cold!"
Gale,An icicle through the heart would have been kinder.
Gale,"I think it's best we close off this little chapter of ours, and focus on writing the rest of the book. Though if it's all the same to you, I'll be skipping the romance."
Gale,I'm afraid you can't always have what you want.
Gale,"And now you've left me stranded, without compass nor map."
Gale,"We didn't just make love. We bonded, body and soul. I got lost in you."
Gale,"To choose Minthara over, well, anyone... It's certainly a brave decision. One might hazard to say reckless. Stupid. Fatal..."
Gale,"You obviously prefer Shadowheart's company to mine. Perhaps I should have taken a leaf from her book and remained an enigma, instead of letting you read me, cover to cover."
Gale,"No doubt it's quite something, to have the heart of one like Karlach. My passion must have seemed damp as a sahuagin's armpit, once you felt the fire within her.<br>"
Gale,"I'm surprised you abandoned me for Wyll, of all people. Had I known you'd a taste for dull blades, I'd have gladly conjured a bouquet of cutlery."
Gale,A broken trinket. Beyond repair from the looks of it.
Gale,Must be the Moonlantern - though it's dark as a moonless night within.
Gale,I know Astarion has a hold on your heart. No doubt he quickens your pulse far more than I. What's a humble archmage in the face of such rakish charms?
Gale,"You remembered where to find me, then?"
Gale,"It's broken, which means we've nothing to protect ourselves from the curse up above."
Gale,I thought you might have been won over by Astarion. His gaudy flourishes no doubt have made many swoon...
Gale,I am as honoured as I am enamoured. I am not the only one who longs for you... yet you chose me.
Gale,Nothing a bit of magic can't solve.
Gale,Mystra.
Gale,With pleasure! Lead on.
Gale,"Let's give them a hand, shall we? Only decent course of action, if you ask me."
Gale,"If it managed to murder a group of Sharrans, we had better watch our step."
Gale,Charming. Hell is truly where we make it.
Gale,"The famous Nere - subject of the myconids' ire, no?"
Gale,"What's on your mind? Apart from finding me an artefact to consume, which I assume you're pursuing with the appropriate urgency."
Gale,"Nothing at all, friend. I was merely admiring your ambition."
Gale,I'm my own man. I make my own choices.
Gale,"Nothing, friend. Just a little trapped wind - I'm sure you understand."
Gale,"You'd give up her location, just like that? You're not actually considering betraying her, are you...?"
Gale,Ambitious wizards and vast power can be a dangerous mix. Careful what you share with him.
Gale,"A shame to wizardry, this one. Still, we should exercise caution."
Gale,"You hear him too, don't you? Nere is not long for this world unless we get him out of there."
Gale,"The ability to walk in broad daylight, for example, with not a burn in sight. I suppose we have your parasite to thank for that. "
Gale,A broken Moonlantern? They say that's ten years of bad luck.
Gale,At first I wasn't sure. Some of your behaviour doesn't exactly match what my traveller's tomes describe of one of your... disposition. 
Gale,I think it's about time you and I had a little chat. An honest one.
Gale,Perhaps it was indeed wise to dissuade me from the Crown of Karsus - a jumped-up wizard drunk on promises of power is not enviable company.
Gale,"Still, there was no real harm done. So long as you can keep that craving of yours in check, I'm happy that our paths remain aligned."
Gale,"And how are you this morning, my blood-thirsty friend?"
Gale,Well then - let's hope you've strength to spare.
Gale,"The great and powerful Lorroakan, offering our humble group an audience? We are honoured."
Gale,I've heard rumours about Lorroakan's 'teaching'. Or lack of it. His students are no more than glorified shopkeeps.
Gale,"That flower isn't agreeing with you, is it? Doesn't sit well with me either."
Gale,Fear is a normal response when one feels one's magic slipping away. No need to lash out.
Gale,Need I remind you you're addressing a wizard? I know what's going on - it's happening to me as well.
Gale,Quack.
Gale,And I'll be delighted to see you try - from a safe distance.
Gale,Our backs are very much prone to stabbing in this environment. So by all means - let's.
Gale,"It is the same for me. We're sitting ducks among sussur flowers, you and I."
Gale,If you'd had your way our number would be one fewer by now. We're fortunate you were caught red-fanged.
Gale,"There is no need for me to bark. My actions will speak for themselves, in time."
Gale,"Pitying, not insolent. You chase one power without knowing an even greater one lies within my reach - the Crown of Karsus."
Gale,He would seek the power of gods for the pettiest of reasons - his own gratification. At least I seek them for the better of all.
Gale,"By all means, carry on. I'll come running if you need me."
Gale,"Debatable. But our common goals remain common, so I see no point in depriving each other of an ally. "
Gale,"Made into a mouthpiece by the elder brain itself. The merest taste of its manipulations, I fear."
Gale,But what does this revelation of yours mean for us going forward?
Gale,"My neck's puncture-free, I've not experienced any overwhelming desire to exsanguinate my nearest and dearest... I can only conclude there's no harm done."
Gale,"I knew you had some dark secret to hide, but a vampire spawn? It wouldn't have been my first guess, I'll put it that way."
Gale,"As you're not willing to engage in a frank conversation on the matter, I think we'll leave it there."
Gale,But why weren't you honest with me? 
Gale,I'd no idea you held such aspirations. Can't say I share them.
Gale,"No need to deny it. The bat's out of the bag, so to speak."
Gale,"I don't care if you eat blood or boiled eggs for breakfast, but if we're to survive this parasitic adventure of ours, we have to trust each other. "
Gale,I can see the truth in that. But you and I aren't 'most people'. 
Gale,I'm sure you could have found your way around that with a bit of imagination.
Gale,"Shouldn't be too much trouble. There will be plenty of bark, but little bite left with their leadership gone."
Gale,"How tragic. Well, lucky for you your master couldn't predict the observational cunning of our troupe's resident Waterdhavian wizard. Your silence spoke volumes."
Gale,"I'm happy to draw a line under the matter and move forward. But from here on, no more hiding things from me. Agreed?"
Gale,I can tell you what I don't like. Unwittingly sleeping next to someone with a taste for blood and a tendency to lie about it.
Gale,"Now, unless you've any other deep, dark secrets to own up to, shall we continue on?"
Gale,Look - a bookseller. She can point us to the tome I need.
Gale,You almost said that without smiling.
Gale,"With that said, I'm more than happy to continue onwards. But no more hiding things from me. Agreed?"
Gale,"Nothing wrong with a bit of caution, I suppose. Better to sound out friends and enemies alike before revealing that kind of secret."
Gale,They say madness and genius are separated by but a hair's breadth. Perhaps the same is true of madness and stupidity.
Gale,"I'm quite open-minded. It's one of my finer qualities, and there's some stiff competition in that department."
Gale,The real conundrum here is why weren't you honest with me? 
Gale,A choice both efficient and pragmatic. Most unlike you.
Gale,I know what it is to have an uncontrollable hunger within you. You can hardly be blamed for your desperation in trying to satisfy it.
Gale,"As I said, I'm willing to move past the whole exsanguination issue, so long as you can promise to keep that hunger of yours in check."
Gale,"Admittedly, that's not saying much given our ongoing predicament. Nonetheless, I'm glad I woke up when I did."
Gale,No devils here. That's a myconid. And it seems to be warning us...
Gale,"No, listen! A myconid... it's warning us."
Gale,That's a myconid. And it's warning us...
Gale,"Charitable bunch, these myconids. At least more so than Kagha and her pet snake.<br>"
Gale,You and I both know the aid a powerful sage could bring us.
Gale,"Scarcely crowned and already issuing orders. Hail Glut, hm?"
Gale,Mystra's elbow! We truly are doomed.
Gale,The limited time for reading that undergoing ceremorphosis leaves pains me so.
Gale,"Not treading carefully, then? Out with a bang it is."
Gale,"Tread carefully, now. Not even a god would survive sacrificing me."
Gale,Would you consider yourself particularly well-read? The aid of someone learned would be of great use to me.
Gale,"I really think we ought to step in here. Whatever his crime, this punishment is surely an overcorrection."
Gale,A great deity needs a great name. Looks like you're off to a good start.
Gale,"You have a familiar twinkle in your touch... you're a wizard, aren't you?"
Gale,Another lick of the cane and those rothés are going on a rampage.
Gale,You saw it too? The fabled adamantine forge is around the bend. We just have a few snags to untangle.
Gale,I assume your choice of apparel isn't the subject of the day. What's on your hind? I mean mind.
Gale,"You look... comfortable. A mite over-exposed, given the perils of our adventure, but I suppose it adds a thrilling edge to leave oneself to open to danger, and... other things."
Gale,Hardly.
Gale,I think we've found two duergar who are going to get spit in their drinks.
Gale,The orb.
Gale,"You look... comfortable. I'd no idea you were inclined to such contraptions. Whatever oils your leather, I suppose."
Gale,The Crown of Karsus.
Gale,You'll have to speak slowly. I'm finding quite difficult to concentrate with my condition gnawing at my insides like a teething displacer kitten.
Gale,"Hold on. This fellow may deserve it, but I don't think the duergar will appreciate you hurting the merchandise."
Gale,That voice... Do you hear it too?
Gale,"To trust a hag, even when she's at your mercy, would be beyond folly. I say we end this."
Gale,"My apologies, don't get your robes in a ruffle!"
Gale,"Hmm, you do have a bit of a glassy look in your eye to be an apprentice."
Gale,"There was nothing friendly about what you just did to me. But I'll humour you - we'll call that a momentary lapse in good sense, shall we?"
Gale,"I've had my suspicions about you for some time now. And there you go, confirming them with truly audacious gusto."
Gale,"Now, much as I enjoy reminiscing about such tomfoolery, I believe we've more pressing matters at hand. Is there anything else?"
Gale,"Fortunately, the Blackstaff himself came to the rescue, hauling me back from the brink, and straight into several months of writing lines. Or rather, finessing my autograph."
Gale,"I was but a child, only a few months into my studies, but already I knew I was destined for greatness. No one believed me, of course, so I decided to prove it. To cast a spell with the Blackstaff itself."
Gale,Ah. Quite. A misadventure from my days as an apprentice at Blackstaff Academy.
Gale,I thought you might drown in Shadowheart's dark eyes... yet you swam to the shores of Gale.
Gale,"A lucky escape, given Lorroakan's reputation. He'd have little of value to teach you."
Gale,(That's it. That's what I need.)
Gale,"(I can't explain now, but it's very important we get hold of that book. Very, very important.)"
Gale,"Whatever you want with this idol, I'd prefer we make it quick. I'm not sure I'm comfortable catching Mystra's eye, even if it is made of stone."
Gale,"As an expert on the subject, my dear lady - I'd like to point out that blowing oneself up is never the solution."
Gale,"She has a heart made of stone, this one - that only smokepowder can break."
Gale,No matter to worry the unlettered over.
Gale,"You're not versed in magic, are you?"
Gale,"If you meet any elder wizards, let me know. There is a matter I'd like to seek advice on from a master."
Gale,"Trust me - it will take a lot more than a few gold pieces and some fervent thoughts to convince Mystra to break her silence. On my account, at least."
Gale,"Commune with her as you see fit. She's your goddess, and I've no wish to stand between you and any blessing she might deign to offer."
Gale,I suppose such wicked killers deserve wicked ends.
Gale,"My, but this sovereign likes to delegate."
Gale,All that scares me in this world is the unknown. Is it brute force that saves you and I each day in battle? No: it's our greater knowledge.
Gale,Commune with her as you see fit. I've no wish to stand between you and any inspiration she might deign to offer.
Gale,I can lend you a third left hand if you need one.
Gale,"We must trust one another, apprentice. You know as well as I: a powerful sage could help us with our plight."
Gale,That could mean any number of things.
Gale,"Oh, don't compare yourself to Khelben. He wastes far too much of his time dying."
Gale,"Not only would this be a vile deal, it would be folly to trust a hag's gifts."
Gale,"Memory loss isn't usually a symptom of ceremorphosis. If it is, they've forgotten to write it down in any text I've read on the subject."
Gale,"We all have our burdens, one way or the other. "
Gale,At least you were never in want of pyjamas.
Gale,"Well, well, quite the scamp yourself, aren't you? Luckily they're more fins than fangs at that age."
Gale,Ha! Go on...
Gale,"And I can pass water without thinking, but that hardly makes it magic."
Gale,"Whether the source is blood or books, magic is hard to master. Do or die indeed."
Gale,"That's mostly a synonym for 'yes', by the by."
Gale,Only when the occasion suits.
Gale,Poor lad would have been harpy feed if it wasn't for us.
Gale,Poor lad would have been harpy feed if it wasn't for you.
Gale,"Anyway, I'm glad we got that boy out of his predicament."
Gale,"Of course, in walked the housekeeper. Screaming, yelling, panic, and before you knew it: fire everywhere."
Gale,"So you made a cow drop out of the sky, which presumably killed it, and yet somehow you found out her name was Stephanie..."
Gale,"There was that magma mephit once. K'ha'ssji'trach'ash, in fact. You met him."
Gale,"So we're travelling with a vampire, are we? Of course we are."
Gale,We all have our hungers to sate. Some just happen to hunger for blood.
Gale,"So we're travelling with a vampire, are we?"
Gale,We all have our hungers to sate. Some just happen to hunger for blood. 
Gale,There was that magma mephit once. Nice fellow - we kept in touch.
Gale,"Well... That depends on who you ask, I suppose. I may have summoned things rather more exotic than a winged cat."
Gale,"Benefits of a wizard's education, you see. Of course my considerable talent didn't hurt either."
Gale,"One time my parents denied me a kitten, so I summoned myself a tressym. Dear old Tara. Beautiful creature."
Gale,"The straight and narrow is a boring road to walk, my friend."
Gale,Comes with the territory.
Gale,And worse.
Gale,Quite right. We all have our hungers to sate. Some just happen to hunger for blood. 
Gale,I think I'll need a drink with the rest of that story.
Gale,Right. Bound to be more urchins to save around here.
Gale,It drew me in. But how?
Gale,Never.
Gale,"A moment's peace, if you will. I need time to process."
Gale,"Sorry, if I'm to engage in banter, I prefer it to be with the leader of our troupe. "
Gale,Incredible.
Gale,So - assuming you're more willing to take my words to heart from now on - what can I do for you?
Gale,Nothing like a good singeing to teach us the perils of dabbling with magic we don't understand. And the wisdom of stepping aside for those who do.
Gale,"Now, given my magical expertise is of limited use to you, was there something else you wanted to ask me about?"
Gale,"There's the makings of a fine follower of Mystra within you, give or take a few decades of studying the Weave."
Gale,When your sky dims... I will be there... waiting...
Gale,Wizard... archmage... companion...
Gale,Wizard... archmage... wielder of the Weave...
Gale,Avoiding... ceremorphosis... removing... tadpole...
Gale,Seeking... another way... to fight... to win...
Gale,Ending... the Absolute... with a bang...
Gale,Seeking... Karsus' power... failed...
Gale,Waterdeep...
Gale,Without knowing... without feeling... choking on darkness...
Gale,Not concentrating... my magic... not focused...
Gale,Bring me back... before... too late... must cast the spell...
Gale,Bring me back... cast the spell... utmost... importance...
Gale,Gale... Dekarios... 
Gale,Elminster came... offered solution... turned... Orin... taken...
Gale,"I would think Netherese, but that's impossible. And yet..."
Gale,Could the effect be reproduced? Perhaps with the right application of Weave...
Gale,Safer to be out here than trapped in there. But if I could remain in there safely...
Gale,That scamp reminds me of myself when I was a nipper. Always getting into trouble.
Gale,Oh to have but a thimbleful of your confidence at my disposal...
Gale,"You may be proven incorrect - time is not on my side, I fear."
Gale,"Please, I do not need to hear of your joint aches and privy sorties again."
Gale,"Mercy is not your strong suit, is it?"
Gale,"I hope you learned your lesson, young man!"
Gale,"Courtesy is quite wasted on this fellow, I see."
Gale,I feel I should warn you that the average goblin foot is host to some two dozen toe-curling diseases.
Gale,Well! I've never seen sleight of tongue quite like that before.
Gale,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I think I've just lost all respect for you."
Gale,Quick thinking! At least there's a silver lining to having yourself horribly scarred for life.
Gale,"Hmm. Not to my taste, but I'll take a clown over some hack magician pulling peonies from his breeches.<br>"
Gale,"No harm - unpretentious grub for intrepid adventurers. After all, you never read what heroes of yore had for their supper, do you?"
Gale,The vittles are... adequate.
Gale,Still though - not everyone wishes for a dead bird or mouse to be laid on their bedroll as a gift.
Gale,Truly? I might as well go mount the gallows.
Gale,"Now I trust you won't give in to your more predatory instincts while you're here, shall you?"
Gale,"You truly are testing the patience of a man who could level a city if he wished, you know."
Gale,"Huzzah! Should this prove embarassing, just imagine the audience in the nude."
Gale,I have not failed to notice. I truly do not deserve such loyal companionship.
Gale,Apologies. Couldn't help myself.
Gale,"Or should I say, positively prosper-puss? Ha!"
Gale,"You seem to have fared well enough without me, Tara. You look positively prosperous."
Gale,"Learned your lesson yet, Astarion? Some people are best left unbitten."
Gale,"Couldn't agree more. But if you use that knife, I will incinerate you."
Gale,Thoroughly magical. Let's have at it.
Gale,Do you think so little of me? At least you didn't compare me to a spotted dick...
Gale,"Bravo. That is indeed where my mind wanders to, when times are hard..."
Gale,"Once, perhaps. But those passions have soured."
Gale,How about you make him kiss your feet next? Pungent poetic justice.
Gale,That's certainly a possibility.
Gale,Lanceboard happens to be a game with which I have more than a passing familiarity. Might I offer a suggestion?
Gale,Loss holds hands with grief - even among goblins.
Gale,As am I.
Gale,"Well now you've found me, perhaps you can share your purpose."
Gale,You worship Shar? Blimey. She and my beloved Mystra are not exactly friends.
Gale,The Blade of Frontiers!
Gale,Duke Wyll Ravengard!
Gale,The Blade of Avernus!
Gale,"If the child's desperate enough to seek safety in our company, who are we to turn her away?"
Gale,"Your hide, your choice. Not quite my cup of tea though."
Gale,I've been known to shuffle a few knights around in my day. Might I offer a suggestion?
Gale,"First, move your white queen to the upper right corner. Then, move her four squares to the left."
Gale,"First, have the white queen move all the way across and capture the black pawn. This leaves black's king in check, forcing him to retreat a square left."
Gale,"Your queen then takes the other pawn, one square up and left, always under the protection of her faithful bishop."
Gale,"First, threaten the black king. Move your rook one square to the right. That leaves black only two choices:"
Gale,"Option one - the black bishop can take your rook. This leaves your queen free to move three squares to the right, and checkmate black's king, your knight pinning him down."
Gale,"Option two - black's king retreats up and right. Your knight can then move two squares left and one up to mate the king, your rook preventing his escape."
Gale,"First, the white queen moves up and right, diagonally, two squares. This allows her to threaten black's king, while protected by her white knight."
Gale,"That's an unusual artefact you have there, Shadowheart. A most unlikely protector..."
Gale,My brain is bursting from my temples...
Gale,The artefact is... protecting us? And not a moment too soon.
Gale,"The king will have no choice but to take the knight, ensnaring himself him between his own pawn and bishop. The white queen can then checkmate by moving one more square up and to the right."
Gale,No apology required. Take all the time you need.
Gale,Whoa! There are a lot of guts to go around in this place. Are you sure you...? Never mind. Too late.
Gale,Charged with magic? Perhaps that explains the ease with which these goblins submit to True Souls.
Gale,The tadpole stirs. It recognises its master...
Gale,"Mum's the word. The quiet before the storm, if you will."
Gale,Well... So much for my previous sentiment.
Gale,Now with added bite.
Gale,[Trade] 
Gale,Good gods.
Gale,She wouldn't ask such a thing if it weren't our only means of survival. However much she's annoyed at me.
Gale,I doubt she's asked many of her followers to blow themselves up. That's a fate she's bequeathed exclusively to me.
Gale,"She expects those who seek to use the Weave to do so honestly, and with respect for its potential to destroy, as well as its potential to save."
Gale,"Sorry, sometimes I just can't help being quite insufferable. In seriousness, I'm glad you asked that question."
Gale,"I do, as a matter of fact."
Gale,And yet you ask.
Gale,"You're one such event that, one day soon perhaps, I'd like to embrace."
Gale,Life is a tempest of events that sometimes we brace against and sometimes embrace.
Gale,"You see, I'm not a big believer in fate, but I do believe in serendipity."
Gale,So do I.
Gale,Do you?
Gale,"Oh, you know me - ever the optimist. I'm trying to focus on the positives."
Gale,Consider yourself lucky you're not.
Gale,"You have to remember that the Weave is a living thing, both the embodiment and the extension of Mystra herself."
Gale,To have one hand on the pulse of divinity.
Gale,It's just that I'm no longer able to perform those feats even arch wizards would marvel at.
Gale,"I've studied magic for many years, and in as many ways I am still a more than capable wizard."
Gale,"The Weave is still here, all around us - inside of us too. As long as the goddess lives, magic is a tangible thing for those who know how to touch."
Gale,Keep it up and she might just take a personal interest in you one of these days.
Gale,You do seem to be a precocious talent though. I can always tell when I meet with a keen mind receptive to Mystra.
Gale,"I've had a pupil or two, but never for very long. Their ineptitudes tend to... irk me."
Gale,"'An eruption the size of Waterdeep', I think my exact words were."
Gale,I can assure you the battlefield would extend well beyond the borders of my body alone.
Gale,"As long as I pay there will peace. But should I ever stop, along comes a war."
Gale,She can give and she can take away. I'm afraid I'm still very much on her naughty list.
Gale,"The truth is, I was living on borrowed time already. Consuming those items would only have kept the orb sated for so long."
Gale,"If anything, I feel more at peace than I have in months. At least now I know my death will have purpose. It won't be a distant 'bang' in the footnotes of history."
Gale,"I've no doubt she has the power to do so, but as for the permission... Ao would not look kindly on her meddling in mortal affairs. Divine intervention has a tendency to make things worse, not better. "
Gale,"So long as he sates his appetite elsewhere, I'm happy to give him the benefit of the doubt."
Gale,"Gods - what are you doing? Take off that mask, right bloody now!"
Gale,What's going on? Something's amiss!
Gale,"I know what it is to hunger... and I know what it takes to keep that hunger under control. He's done that so far, despite his condition. "
Gale,"Though the orb still seems to offer our best hope of destroying the brain, I retain some hope that another, less costly solution can be found."
Gale,"For now, to have a few more days in your company... no, I wouldn't change a thing."
Gale,"The orb's power is undiminished. If we do not succeed, I will not hesitate when the time comes. "
Gale,"I regret many things in my life. Choosing to be here, intact and unexploded, is not one of them."
Gale,"He clearly sees something in me that I can't. The wisdom and intelligence required to overcome almost insurmountable odds, perhaps. Or the stupidity required to attempt it."
Gale,"She has interfered to the extent she is permitted to. What happens next depends on us, and whether we can destroy the Absolute without using the orb."
Gale,"Of course, if I succeed in wielding the crown, she'll have no say on the matter. But first, we must find a way to claim it."
Gale,"I think not. She's furious I refused her, of course, but she wouldn't deprive the realms of my abilities at such a critical juncture."
Gale,"You've not taken this power for yourself. So I can only wonder, why offer it to me?"
Gale,"In spite of my admittedly fierce curiosity, I'll have to decline. My humanity, however frail, is rather important to me for now. I'd rather keep it intact, if it's all the same to you. "
Gale,"If this is what the fates have offered to aid our cause, then who am I to refuse? I'll take your tadpole. Let's see what it has to offer."
Gale,I can only imagine what I could do were I to adopt the biology of a mind flayer...
Gale,"If worst comes to worst, I will be gone long before the curtain falls."
Gale,I cherish you.
Gale,I promise I will not betray your trust. You kept me by your side despite the menace that I am.
Gale,I will await that death alone.
Gale,"I will find the remotest place on the surface of Faerûn, or perhaps far below in the depths of the Underdark."
Gale,"If it should ever come to that, if I ever know I am no longer able to stop it, I will do anything I can to ensure no one but me pays for my mistakes."
Gale,The very same.
Gale,"Ah, yes. Karsus."
Gale,"As for Elminster... He's saved the realms more times than legend can recount. But to take on a god is no easy feat, even for him. My orb is the best chance we have - and only I can wield it."
Gale,Think of it as... tribute. The kind a king might pay to a more powerful neighbour to avoid invasion.
Gale,"It has become my sustenance. Without it... Well, I hardly need to tell you."
Gale,"Think of it as vampirism. You need blood to sustain yourself, I need magic."
Gale,"If nothing else, I'm sure I piqued your curiosity."
Gale,"Best we save any discussions for later, given the circumstances."
Gale,Truly horrendous.
Gale,You'll have to excuse me a moment. I've got pondering to do.
Gale,"Well, there was an invitation to leave if I ever heard one. Good luck in your endeavours - you shall certainly need it."
Gale,I sense you don't quite appreciate the urgency of the matter. Dawdling may cost us dearly.
Gale,"Very well. A little longer won't hurt... Actually, it might, but I shall try all the same."
Gale,I see. Let me remind you that this is not something that can be ignored forever. Artefacts are of little use if you don't live to enjoy them.
Gale,"Of course. I would hate for you to think me impatient, or ungrateful. I shall persevere, for now."
Gale,But it will save my life - even if only temporarily.<br>
Gale,I will consume the magic inside. What was a powerful artefact will be rendered no more than a trinket.
Gale,"Most unhelpful. In that case, I shall have to seek my own salvation. Elsewhere."
Gale,My condition requires a delicate touch. Just one item will suffice to keep it in check.
Gale,Please - just one artefact will be enough for now.
Gale,"I'm glad to see you're so well-stocked on suitable relics, but I only need one."
Gale,I might need you to be more specific there. Just one artefact will suffice.
Gale,"Listen, I need to speak to you. It would be unconscionable of me to remain silent."
Gale,And a waste it might have been.
Gale,"I'm what one might call a wizard prodigy, who from an early age could not only control the Weave, but compose it, much like a musician or a poet."
Gale,What I am is a walking shadow of the promise I once held.
Gale,You have to know who I was. You have to know who I really am.
Gale,"I appreciate it greatly, but I can no longer keep you in the dark."
Gale,I might just be about to remedy that.
Gale,"Listen, I need to speak to you, to all of you. It would be unconscionable of me to remain silent."
Gale,It hardly has any effect. Mystra have mercy on us all.
Gale,"I don't know what to make of this. Three artefacts is a positive glut of magic, yet my hunger only grows."
Gale,"If you'd prefer to rely on beginner's luck than my myriad experiences in studying such magics, who am I to judge? "
Gale,Thank you!
Gale,How can I help?
Gale,What's on your mind?
Gale,"I find that a healthy amount of theatrics - a voice from the beyond, a magic flute, a friendly if highly combustible magma mephit - tends to make for a more compelling case."
Gale,Like I said: I'm dangerous even in death. I'm merely trying to protect those around me.
Gale,"The instructions were easy enough, weren't they? If slightly elaborate."
Gale,The end may be close. Time to reap what we have sown.
Gale,Please. There is little more to be said on the subject. The best thing you and I can do is march on... towards whatever awaits us.
Gale,"Whatever comes next, I must consider with a rational mind, not an emotional one. There are more important things out there than you and I. You made that quite clear."
Gale,"Please, do not not dredge that up. My unhappiness has only just settled to the bottom."
Gale,"I'd much rather gaze into your eyes than hers. Yours are capable of tenderness, and feeling. No god could ever compare."
Gale,"In her likeness, I used to read a thousand stories. She was beauty, wisdom, elegance, power... she contained universes. But now... it is hard to see any redeeming qualities in a lover who condemned you to death."
Gale,"Strangely, no. Once, a mere glimpse of her face would have been enough to turn my insides over, but not this time."
Gale,Apologies. I was foolish enough to convince myself that I was enough for you.
Gale,Enjoy your open relationship. Ideally far from my view.
Gale,"I see. Thank you - this is most illuminating. I had thought I had the measure of your character, but clearly there is much I have yet to learn."
Gale,"Very well. Let's... let's not speak of this again. Given my condition, I'm not sure it's wise for me invite undue stress upon myself."
Gale,"Call me selfish, or old-fashioned, but I cannot agree to that. Either we dedicate ourselves to one another, or this ends here."
Gale,That is most gratifying to hear. May I?
Gale,"I do not yet need to consume an item, but keep it close by. It will not be too much longer."
Gale,"Your enterprising approach to my problem is most encouraging, but it is a delicate process to keep my condition stable."
Gale,"Ah. Then I expect he's told you at least some of my story? Allow me to give my own side, for a moment."
Gale,"Worry not. I carry my regrets wherever I go, and am used to their weight. One more will not break my back."
Gale,I hope you and Minthara are very happy together. Or miserable. Whatever she prefers.
Gale,Consider our nascent spark of romance thoroughly extinguished. The wizard is out of the picture. 
Gale,"Right. Well, far be it for me to stand in the way of true love. Or anything else Minthara wants, for that matter."
Gale,"Still, I see no harm in learning what we can about this 'Nightsong'. And, if we manage to find it, the harm will be all Ketheric's. So, well worth indulging our curiosity."
Gale,"Still, what harms Ketheric helps us, and to deny him the source of his invulnerability would be a very efficient way of harming him indeed. "
Gale,"Go ahead, I'm listening."
Gale,"For now, let's consider that particular matter settled. Was that the only thing on your mind?"
Gale,"I take it as a compliment either way. You don't get to be thirteen centuries old without becoming a sound judge of character. And cheese, apparently."
Gale,"Quite an oddity to behold... but not without beauty, either."
Gale,"When the time comes for the orb to fulfil its purpose, I will think of only one thing. Your face. Nothing else will matter."
Gale,Like I missed a golden opportunity. And now I'm going to pay a far higher price for the same prize.
Gale,"With the crown, our fates will be in our owns hands at last. So long as we do't let go of each other."
Gale,"The same way as you are, I hope. Determined. Focused. A tad impatient. "
Gale,"I'm not sure I'd be brave enough for such a dream without you by my side. So, thank you. For believing in me."
Gale,"Wonderful. At last, I can see a path ahead that doesn't end with me needing to turn this city into a desolate wasteland."
Gale,"Believe me when I say how important this could be for me. For both of us. Potentially lifesaving, so long as we can learn how it can be taken, and used."
Gale,More excited than I've been in months. I can't tell you how curious I am to learn more about the crown controlling that elder brain.
Gale,"Still, each new dawn with you is a blessing I didn't dare to hope for. Selfish as I'm no doubt being - I'm grateful for that."
Gale,"But being in this place, knowing what lies within poses such a threat... I hope the only heart that's broken here is the Absolute's. I'd never forgive myself for breaking yours."
Gale,"Worried, if I'm being honest. I have so much to live for - more than I thought I'd have again, after Mystra."
Gale,"I'd have hoped to spend our final moments together somewhere more romantic, but it seems we won't have much of a say in the matter."
Gale,"Trying not to think about what lies ahead, if I'm being honest."
Gale,"At a loss, really. People have always commented on my confidence, sometimes my over-confidence, and in one particularly cut-throat assessment at university - my 'abject and incorrigible self-delusion.' "
Gale,"Someone apart from my tressym, that is."
Gale,Glad to have met you though. At least I'm going out on a high.
Gale,"Oh, you know. Filled with the bottomless dread that can only come from your own impending and self-inflicted death."
Gale,You've actually caught me at an inopportune time. Blasted dust in my eye. Excuse me...
Gale,Oh. I see. That's disappointing. 
Gale,"To know you love me for the man I am, and not the magic I command... None have loved me so purely before. "
Gale,"You are everything to me, and yet our relationship is only a nascent fraction of what it will become. You give me hope, and I've not had that in some time."
Gale,"To know you are not frightened by my ambition. That you would nurture it, and meld it with your own... I cannot imagine a better partner on any plane of existence."
Gale,"You must know, our relationship is the brightest spot in our otherwise bleak endeavour."
Gale,"Gods, don't tempt me. I'm finding it hard enough to resist you as it is. "
Gale,There's nothing that would give me greater pleasure.
Gale,"... or, the king can retreat up and right, but then your knight can move two squares left and one up to mate the king while the rook covers all escapes."
Gale,"The black bishop can take the white rook, in which case your queen is free to move three squares to the right, and checkmate the king under cover of your knight..."
Gale,You threaten the black king with your rook by moving it one square right. That gives black two choices:
Gale,"Grateful, mostly. For meeting you. For having someone who cares that I'm here, alive, and not reduced to a cloud of netherese vapour. "
Gale,"To put my faith in someone else, and trust that we will find a better way together... it's a rather new experience for me. One I'm enjoying, for the most part. But a new one nonetheless."
Gale,"I'm many things to many people, but I'm never a man to throw the l-word around lightly."
Gale,Plenty of them. And all complicated.
Gale,"Oh, I was surprised. But pleasantly so, just like I said."
Gale,"Why would you even bring this up? Come, let's go. I'm not in the mood for chatter."
Gale,"That I still looked as handsome as ever, that's what."
Gale,What did I think about seeing my head on a spike?
Gale,"Treating you to the real deal, that's what."
Gale,What did I think about an imaginary blow to the stomach?
Gale,Yet it is life's most worthy pursuit in my impartial if not humble opinion.
Gale,"Of course, as a cleric, your patron deity endows you with many such powers otherwise unattainable. I do hope you cherish that gift."
Gale,"Of course, as a paladin, your patron deity endows you with many such powers otherwise unattainable. I do hope you cherish that gift."
Gale,"Of course, as a warlock, your patron endows you with many such powers otherwise unattainable. I do hope you cherish that gift."
Gale,"Of course, as a sorcerer, these talents come to you quite naturally. I do hope you cherish that gift."
Gale,But I was still your conduit. To perform such a feat alone requires much and arduous study.
Gale,"Don't get me wrong, you did well! The somatic component, the verbal component, even the focus on the inner self that invites Mystra in."
Gale,I assure you it is not.
Gale,"Not a goddess whose attention I would usually welcome. I'd my suspicions of course, but I'm not entirely pleased to have them confirmed."
Gale,Better to illuminate one's darkest depths early on in any promising relationship. Less chance of drowning in them later on. Thank you for telling me.
Gale,"Better to be told late than never, I suppose. But in future - I find that honesty is the best policy when it comes to finding allies. And keeping them."
Gale,I see you've taken Shar's love of secrecy to heart.
Gale,"Thank you for trusting me. I assure you, your secret is safe with me."
Gale,"Far be it for me to judge others for their choice of goddess. Though I hope there's some light for you, amongst all that darkness. Those who give Shar too much purchase can find themselves snuffed out completely."
Gale,"Shar, eh? Goddess of blackest night and the most melancholy souls... I suspected there was more to your secrecy than met the eye."
Gale,"No matter. After all, a bond like ours hardly needs words to express it. What else is troubling you?"
Gale,"After so long with Mystra, I have to say the pleasures of mortal love are much sweeter than I remember. Though perhaps that's simply because it's with you."
Gale,"When the true danger posed by my condition became apparent, I had no choice but to sequester myself away from civilised society. A reclusive wizard - who'd have thought?"
Gale,"No, you are not the first. Though you are the first since my relationship with Mystra came to its ignominous end."
Gale,What a question...
Gale,I regret the way I hurt her. Of course I do. But she would have seen me destroy myself to earn her forgiveness. There is no love lost between us. None at all.
Gale,"I was not the first wizard to fall under her spell, nor will I be the last. I was an amusement to her, a mortal to be trifled with, amused, and eventually discarded."
Gale,"It's not easy to turn away from one you once loved, but now that I see our relationship with all the illumination hindsight has to offer, I mostly feel only regret."
Gale,"Then, the queen takes the other pawn, one square up and left, while moving in the protection of the bishop."
Gale,"Amid the madness that has befallen us, it seems almost out of place to think of a kiss."
Gale,Might as well take part in this Absolute charade if that buys us both time and our lives.
Gale,"The king can only withdraw to one square after the first move, and after the second has nowhere to retreat."
Gale,"But I had to finally tell you. Silence would have been far worse behaviour still. Nevertheless, I am sorry."
Gale,To share such a night with you only to tell you of a previous lover the next morning... It wasn't the most gentleman-like behaviour.
Gale,"Before we go on though, do first let me apologise."
Gale,"It was wonderful, wasn't it?"
Gale,A night to remember.
Gale,"Ever the pragmatist in chief, aren't you?"
Gale,"You do plenty for me, more than you realise. But this cannot be remedied."
Gale,"Thank you, for the artefact. A great deal of trouble it was to... A great deal of trouble indeed."
Gale,"I'm not certain what's going on, but nothing good. Please, I need to think... I need to retrace my steps to a glade of calm and think."
Gale,It merely drizzles. The embers still sizzle. The fire remains undefeated.
Gale,"The magic isn't having the effect it should have. It's not like last time, like a rainstorm that quells a forest fire."
Gale,"Somehow the second artefact hasn't had the effect of the first. It's somewhat relieved the discomfort, but I fear my hunger hasn't quite... Ahh..."
Gale,"It is a strange experience each time anew - like a lost soul is spelunking through the darkness that is me, only to be sacrificed on the dread altar of the heart."
Gale,I never credited Bhaal with a sense of humour. This is some sick joke of his - let's not be part of it.
Gale,"Please, think on the matter. I trust that during our travels you'll navigate ample leagues of progressive insight."
Gale,I myself am a much more powerful artefact in your arsenal. Rest assured of that.
Gale,I obtained it in Waterdeep. Nothing there comes cheap.
Gale,I bow to your boundless kindness.
Gale,"My lord, I bow to your boundless kindness!"
Gale,"My lady, I bow to your boundless kindness!"
Gale,"Sincerely though: I understand I ask a lot from you with few answers in return, but in time all will be told."
Gale,"Grateful as I am, the course of our camaraderie is much better served by not taking that particular detour. Not just yet."
Gale,My words. My actions. My award winning smile.
Gale,"Oh, it's not so bad once you get used to it. And on the plus side, my tower in Waterdeep has never been so free of clutter."
Gale,A metaphorical demon I haste to point out. But no less dangerous - and no less bound to wake up again to continue its ravages. Such is the nature of all monsters.
Gale,I can feel it work. The magic is like a lullaby that sings to sleep the demon inside.
Gale,That hit the spot.
Gale,Entirely up to you. What's on your mind?
Gale,"I understand your reluctance, but to ignore my condition is to invite catastrophe."
Gale,"You're quite spectacular, you know."
Gale,"Yes, it was."
Gale,But you first approached me 'about the other night'. What was it you wanted to tell me?
Gale,"Queen to H8 - that's the upper right corner - then to D8, four squares left."
Gale,"The king can only respond by capturing the knight, but in doing so gets trapped by his own pawn and bishop, so the queen can checkmate by moving one more square up and to the right."
Gale,"The white queen moves up and right, diagonally, two squares, so that she threatens the black king and is covered by her white knight."
Gale,"Not that I'm one to talk, of course."
Gale,"If it takes the death of a god to stop you, I'd say your ambition has gotten somewhat out of hand."
Gale,Loving them has its side effects as well.
Gale,Quite so.
Gale,Gale's Folly one might call it. History. Repetition. It's the way things go.
Gale,I tried to control only a fraction of the magic that was unleashed that fateful day. I merely sought to return one tiny diamond to an imperfect crown.
Gale,"Now, so many centuries later, I tried to follow in the footsteps of Karsus, not to destroy Mystra, but to prove my love for her."
Gale,Thaniel? That's the very lad - or spiriti - that Halsin needs to find.
Gale,Music's a powerful source of memories. We might be able to bring him around if we find what he used to play.
Gale,Lost in the shadows all this time... he must have left some part of himself behind. Something we can use.
Gale,"Mystryl was reborn as Mystra. Upon her return, the Weave returned with her."
Gale,For a spell.
Gale,An event that came to be known as Karsus' Folly.
Gale,"As the-child-who-would-be-a-god was turned to stone, his empire came crashing down around him. The floating cities of Netheril were no more."
Gale,"It was the end of Mystryl, the end of Karsus, and the end of an entire civilisation."
Gale,Too late did he realise what he had unleashed. It would have been the end of everything had not Mystryl sacrificed herself.
Gale,"As Karsus aimed his spell at her, she began to unravel, and with her, the entire Weave."
Gale,"Mystryl, she was called then. Imagine what it must have felt like. To be a god. To know yourself to be untouchable. To be mistaken."
Gale,And he tried. With a spell of his own devising he endeavoured to usurp in one fell swoop the power of the goddess of magic.
Gale,"Karsus was perhaps the most powerful wizard that ever lived. The-child-who-would-be-a-god, the elves called him."
Gale,"I've had a goddess, but you don't hear me complaining."
Gale,That's certainly a word for it.
Gale,Then let me clear your mind of doubts: it absolutely wasn't.
Gale,"It's cruel to tease, you know."
Gale,"We absolutely should. After all, I need to undo the misconception you've had better."
Gale,There's the magic word.
Gale,"Let's see... the white queen moves all the way across and captures the black pawn. The black king is in check, so he has to retreat a square left."
Gale,"So long as our quest leads us to the destruction of the Absolute, I suppose we should continue on together. But I tell you now - I've no interest in serving any god, Bhaal or otherwise."
Gale,"Amid the madness that has befallen us, it seems almost out of place to think of a romantic walk."
Gale,"And yet, now more than ever, it's important to recall what makes us human."
Gale,"You look, erm... Well the main thing is, you're alive. Plenty to be grateful for, horns or no horns."
Gale,Careful where you tread here. A hag's magic is not to be trifled with.
Gale,"Once she gets to know me, I'm sure she'll open up. She's just waiting for someone ready to listen."
Gale,"Minthara's something of a closed book, but I suspect a heart of gold lurks beneath that stern countenance."
Gale,"I think we've done rather a good thing here. A welcome change, to gift this land a sliver of hope amongst so much despair."
Gale,"We should consider Orin's terms carefully, however distasteful we may find them."
Gale,Lae'zel was a formidable addition to our party. Our odds without her are diminished. 
Gale,"I never thought this journey of ours would see us knocking on a devil's door. Can't say I'm relishing the experience, but needs must."
Gale,Not entirely sure I'm a fan of being trapped at the bottom of the Chionthar. Better get ourselves out of here. Quickly.
Gale,"A hero of legend, passing the figurative torch on to us."
Gale,"Whatever they are, Shadowheart will pay dearly for them. Shar will make sure of it."
Gale,"For your sake, I hope they are secrets worth their price. I wouldn't care to have Shar's wrath at my back."
Gale,"What secrets does the aasimar promise to reveal, I wonder? "
Gale,I can't help feeling Wyll got off lightly. The wrath of the hells is second only the wrath of the heavens.
Gale,"Nasty way to go, suffocating slowly under a tonne of rubble. Not a fate I'd personally relish."
Gale,"Please know - I've no desire to pry into anyone else's past, especially one that's left its scars."
Gale,"You made a good decision, refusing that devil's contract."
Gale,"Our githyanki companion thinks little of killing those who deny her. An admirable quality, so long as her desires align with our own."
Gale,"To threaten the life of a child... truly, Orin will stop at nothing."
Gale,"Walking freely out of a githyanki crèche... A miracle if ever I've seen one. And trust me, I've seen quite a few."
Gale,"Lae'zel's devotion is impressive, but if she's not careful it will be fatal. Gods consider mortals like us a cheap token to trade in for their desired outcomes, at least in my experience."
Gale,"Your devotion is impressive, but be careful it's not fatal. Gods consider mortals like us a cheap token to trade in for their desired outcomes, at least in my experience."
Gale,Who knew Vlaakith and Mystra would have so much in common? Both set on flinging their followers towards destruction without so much as deigning to justify it.
Gale,No sense dawdling. Karlach has precious little time left to her - we'd do better than to waste it.
Gale,"The sooner we're back on solid ground, the better."
Gale,"Not all wizards are made the same, nor do we wield the same powers."
Gale,I think a quick death is the best one could hope for.
Gale,A very hard thing to predict. We've already witnessed the myriad forms its corruption has inflicted on this land and its inhabitants.
Gale,"I'll gladly talk to you about such matters when the time comes. But for now, let's speak of other things."
Gale,"Having a devil in our camp will certainly make things interesting. Never a dull day, is there?"
Gale,"My apologies. I'm not quite myself just yet. I had the strangest dream last night. A visitor came to me, a vision of unparalleled beauty and power."
Gale,"She told me she was watching over me, protecting me. And, that our tadpoles could prove beneficial, if we embrace what powers they have to offer."
Gale,"Any opportunities for us to indulge our tadpole's capabilities are hardly on the same scale. Trifles, when one considers the bigger picture."
Gale,"As existential evils go, the Absolute certainly seems an adversary worth halting in its  tracks. "
Gale,"Your confidence in our existing capabilities is quite rousing, though. Perhaps that spirited enthusiasm will be strength enough to subdue the Cult when the time comes."
Gale,"I admire the vigour with which you uphold your principles, but I would remind you that the evils of the Absolute are far greater than any moral compromise we might make by using our tadpoles' full potential."
Gale,"I've no wish to cast any aspersions on our existing skill set, of course, but given the perilous direction in which our journey is headed, the tadpole's powers might be a welcome addition to our arsenal."
Gale,This 'source' she referred to and the 'Heart of the Absolute' might be one and the same.
Gale,"I've been dreaming of our enigmatic visitor again. She told me our purpose was to take on this 'Cult of the Absolute', to infiltrate its ranks and bring it down from the inside."
Gale,"Orin was a monster, whatever her form. I suppose growing up somewhere like this would make a monster of anyone."
Gale,"You know this for yourself, of course. So was there some other matter you needed to discuss?"
Gale,"It is no small thing to be a god's Chosen. Whatever life you once claimed to lead, it only follows from now on. Where Bhaal leads, you will be forced to go."
Gale,"If Gortash is to be believed, then even our camp isn't safe from Orin's influence. We might want to confirm the veracity of his claim. Or at least, clean up the mess."
Gale,"Whatever business Wyll has with Mizora, it will cost him dearly. Or worse still, it will cost us. I hope we can afford it."
Gale,"Mizora one step ahead of you as always. What chaos will we deal with in her wake, I wonder?"
Gale,"Not the resounding success we were hoping for. Still, the price of ambition is occasionally catastrophic failure. At least our skulls remain intact."
Gale,"I've not seen infernal flames like that in quite some time. Why go to Avernus, when you can bring Avernus to us?"
Gale,"Speaking of which, I assume you came with some other subject on your mind?"
Gale,"Or perhaps, a certain parasite that's clamped its jaws into me. Regardless, you're right. Better to stay focused on the real world's problems, than the fantasy of an easy solution."
Gale,I hope your confidence proves well-founded. God knows we could use all the help we can get.
Gale,"If so, we have far more to learn about the powers at play here. Our ignorance as to the exact nature and intent of our saviours is hardly cause for celebration."
Gale,"Still, it might be wiser to  keep an open mind on the matter. Our visitors' promises of aid might yet bear valuable fruit."
Gale,Nothing wrong with maintaining a healthy suspicion in such matters.
Gale,"Still, your caution in this instance is well-advised. Let's see whether our dream visitors come good on their promises, or if they too were no more than a passing illusion."
Gale,Do not dismiss the truth of dreams out of hand. They can be portentous to quite alarming degrees.
Gale,"Another unique quality of our predicament, perhaps. Are you inclined to take these visitors at their word?"
Gale,"Very curious. In all my readings on the effects of illithid parasites, I've never come across any accounts of correlating dreams between infected parties."
Gale,"Until then, best we speak of other matters. Was there something you wished to ask?"
Gale,"Whether she spoke the truth or not... Well, I think I require a little more evidence before taking a fantasy at her word."
Gale,"A real manifestation, perhaps. But not an individual of flesh and blood in the manner you or I would consider to be 'real.'"
Gale,An uncanny apparition. I'm not entirely sure what to make of it.
Gale,"True enough. The gods can be loathe to tread on one another's toes, claws, wings and so forth. But they think little of controlling mortals."
Gale,"Is that so? Well let's hope that continues to be the case. There's no guarantee our cure will be found lurking in the darkness, after all."
Gale,Whoever inflicted the shadows on this land was no ordinary spellcaster. And certainly had no fear of Mystra's punishment for doing so.
Gale,Her doctrine is more than just a personal opinion - it forms the very essence of wizardry. I'm in no rush to discard it.
Gale,"I think we taught that inquisitor a very valuable lesson. He won't be ambushing anyone else in a hurry. Or doing anything else, for that matter."
Gale,"When the time comes, Astarion will have his revenge I'm sure. And it will be richly deserved. But not yet, so what can I do for you?"
Gale,I can't imagine how Astarion must be feeling. The terms of your own condemnation carved into your skin... A monster's actions. And monsters do not deserve such power as that ritual promised. 
Gale,"An admirable choice, if not one that will make achieving our purpose any easier."
Gale,"You possess great strength of will, to resist the lure of such powers as Cazador sought to wield."
Gale,"A privilege to witness such a reunion. Shadowheart deserves to have her family restored, when Shar has taken so much from her already."
Gale,"Your parents will soon be well again, and you will have much to catch up on. Something to look forward to, once the world is safe again."
Gale,"A devil and devil hunter, standing shoulder to shoulder against a common enemy. Rather poetic, I think."
Gale,We should inform her of his delusions. No doubt she'll have great fun dispelling them.
Gale,"If that charlatan Lorroakan thinks he can best Dame Aylin, he's even more clueless than I believed."
Gale,"Fairly certain. Prudence was a contributing factor, at the very least."
Gale,"I'm certain it was merely prudence steering Jaheira's hand, and not any mistrust as to our heroic abilities. "
Gale,"Certainly. That I have a great respect for privacy, for instance - especially my own."
Gale,A pity Shadowheart chose to depart our company. I'd grown quite fond of that Sharran wit of hers.
Gale,I have a very disciplined mind: those tricks won't work on me.
Gale,Please don't try that again unless I invite you to.
Gale,Nothing. What you saw was merely mental disorientation brought about by your intrusion.
Gale,"Nevertheless, please don't try that again unless I invite you to."
Gale,Not an eventuality I'm entirely unfamiliar with.
Gale,That was... uncalled for.
Gale,Out!
Gale,Didn't that paint enough of a picture?
Gale,There.
Gale,"I have a cat, a library, and a weakness for a good glass of wine. And if the mood takes me, I'm known to try my hand at poetry."
Gale,"Let's see. I hail from Waterdeep, the City of Splendours. I'm a wizard of considerable acclaim, and scholar of exceptional accomplishment."
Gale,They promise things to come.
Gale,A stolen glance - that sudden heartbeat... Sometimes the little things are worth more than kingdoms.
Gale,"And yet, now more than ever, it's important to recall what makes us human. Well - you know what I mean."
Gale,And please don't try that again unless I invite you to.
Gale,"We have our first victory, but we'll need more before this day is through. The momentum is with us - we must keep moving."
Gale,"What life is left to you now, I wonder? A slow decline? A sudden, painful extinguishing? Bhaal does not forgive."
Gale,"I shouldn't speculate on such matters. We'll find out in due course, I'm sure."
Gale,I'd say I've learned to interpret it with a degree of flexibility.
Gale,"There's no denying a certain perfume of decay hangs over such dark magic, but that isn't to say it can't be put to good use. Or at the very least, neutral use."
Gale,Magic has no inherent morality - it's effect is entirely down to the inclinations of the wielder.
Gale,Not necessarily.
Gale,"I did. But our situation warrants we explore every opportunity presented to us, however grim."
Gale,Aha. What an interesting question...
Gale,"Now, I think it's time we moved on to lighter subjects, before we too are lost to the darkness. Was there anything else?"
Gale,"Mystra cannot destroy it, even if she wishes to, but she can try to ensure her followers resist its temptations."
Gale,"These shadows were drawn from another source, created by another goddess: Shar."
Gale,"Mystra's domain is the Weave, and the magic that courses through it."
Gale,Followers of Mystra - those who call on the true Weave - are expressly forbidden to indulge it.
Gale,"It is the very antithesis of all the Weave stands for, a magic of confusion and corruption, drawn forth only by those desperate or damned enough to accept its degradations."
Gale,Ceremorphosis is Karlach's only chance of survival. It must be her.
Gale,Sorry - I didn't ask why you sought me out. Do you need anything of me?
Gale,"It is unsettling, to know we have such eyes as Orin's upon our party."
Gale,A grim sight to behold when you're as bone-weary as we are.
Gale,"None should be forced to make such a choice. If Orpheus is willing to undergo ceremorphosis, then it is his will, and should be respected."
Gale,"Another joins our merry band. We'll need to keep our wits sharp around him, I think."
Gale,Thank Mystra for that. Can't say I was enamored with the thought of spending my final moments buried under a thousand tonnes of limestone.
Gale,"Goblins aren't known for their cleanliness, but by Mystra's mantle, this place is rotten. The fewer breaths we take here, the better."
Gale,"Beneath her forbidding countenance, I sense this cleric will prove quite the companion. A wise decision to let her join us."
Gale,His intelligence may yet prove the key to unlocking the artefact's secrets. We should ensure we follow up when we reach Baldur's Gate.
Gale,"What will Voss have to show for himself when we catch up with him, I wonder?"
Gale,"Quite the risk, to place your faith in the promises of one outside Vlaakith's control. I knew there was a rebellious streak in you somewhere."
Gale,"Revenge is a dish best served hot, it seems. At least when you're in charge of the menu."
Gale,"So much blood... I wonder, will I ever get the stink of it from my nostrils..."
Gale,Who knows how long the real Minthara has been strapped to Orin's altar? We owe it to her to bring her back safely. She would do no less for you or I.
Gale,"Orin, masquerading as Minthara... That certainly explains her vociferous antipathy towards me."
Gale,"A githyanki joining our company. Not a collaboration I'd have anticipated, but a welcome one nonetheless."
Gale,"Of course. Sometimes I forget who I'm travelling with. It takes some getting used to, walking amongst peers again. "
Gale,"Total amnesia isn't usually a symptom of ceremorphosis. If it is, they've forgotten to write it down in any text I've read on the subject."
Gale,"Much obliged. Besides, I suspect the real villain here is one we have in common."
Gale,A vampire spawn? I'd hazard that's an attribute you're well justified in keeping to yourself. I'm glad you felt you could trust me with it.
Gale,"She restored the Weave, reuniting all its scattered shards. Or so I thought, until in the course of my studies I learned of a book. A Netherese tome in which a piece of the fractured Weave had been sealed beyond her reach."
Gale,"Even the Weave itself could not withstand the onslaught. It fractured, then shattered, and all magic was lost to the mortal realms until the day Mystra returned."
Gale,"The magic unleashed that day was phenomenal, roiling like the prime chaos that outdates creation."
Gale,"He almost managed, but not quite, and his entire empire - Netheril - came crashing down around him as he turned to stone."
Gale,"I'll save his history for another time, but the gist of it is that he sought to usurp the goddess of magic so that he could become a god himself."
Gale,"Once upon a very long time ago, a mighty lord lived in a tower. A flying tower, to be precise."
Gale,Very well. Here goes:
Gale,"We come now to the crux of my folly. Shall I share the story behind it, or would you rather head straight to its sordid finale?"
Gale,"As inconceivable as it seems to me now, I shared a bed with a goddess and yet I wasn't satisfied. So I sought to prove myself worthy to her instead."
Gale,"I tried to convince her. I pouted, I pleaded, I swore my ambition was only to serve her better. But she only smiled and told me to be contented."
Gale,That's no cure - it's going to kill you. Get out!
Gale,There has to be a way to stop this thing!
Gale,I sought to cross her boundaries.
Gale,"'What if', I thought, 'What if after all this time, I could return this lost part of herself to the goddess?'"
Gale,"Mystra keeps us in check. There are boundaries she doesn't let us cross. Yet every time I was with her, I stood on the precipice, gazing into the wonders that lay beyond."
Gale,"We enjoyed each other's company - body, mind and soul. But even so, I desired more."
Gale,Oh yes.
Gale,The Dawnstar. A beacon to Lathander's faithful - and a startlingly potent artefact.
Gale,"She revealed herself to me and she became my teacher. In time, she became my muse, and later, even my lover."
Gale,Are you quite sure that's wise? We should leave this untouched and get out of here.
Gale,We should leave this untouched and get out of here.
Gale,"Hmm. Well, I appreciate your honesty. If you trust me enough to confess this, in spite of our disagreements, that's no small thing."
Gale,Are you quite sure that's wise?
Gale,"I don't know the exact magnitude of the eruption, but given my studies of Netherese magic, I'd say even a fragment as small as the one I carry..."
Gale,"I wonder, how did the Illithid Empire fall?"
Gale,I will erupt.
Gale,"As long I absorb traces of the Weave from potent enough sources, it remains quiet. Were it ever to fully destabilise, however..."
Gale,Terrifying isn't it? And that is only the beginning.
Gale,"You see, no matter how powerful a wizard we mortals can become, we never scratch more than the surface of the Weave."
Gale,"I'm sorry, but I had to. After all, this is only the beginning."
Gale,"The answer was to try, and the outcome was to fail."
Gale,I certainly thought so. Sometimes there is great strength to be found in symbolism.
Gale,It'd level a city the size of Waterdeep.
Gale,"Fortunately, this need no longer be a concern. Not until I meet the Heart of the Absolute - whatever that is."
Gale,I swear to you I wasn't. But I've no choice but to admit I am now. Perhaps it would be best if I leave and put as much distance between us as I can before the orb erupts.
Gale,"Carry out Mystra's wishes, I suppose. Though that would be a very drastic solution, if you can even call it that."
Gale,We might chance upon a king's collection of magical artefacts around the corner. We might cross paths with a miracle round the bend. Then again - we might not.
Gale,"All of this... It must feel like a betrayal. Say the word, and we'll part ways."
Gale,"That is - a great relief. Oh, a great relief indeed!"
Gale,You truly are a soul that steels my own. From all my new-rallied heart I thank you.
Gale,"I thank you all. I understand if you stand against me. I'm humbled if you stand with me. Either way, I will do my best not to let you down."
Gale,"I stand at a precipice, but if you do not give up hope, neither shall I. I'll fight, I'll resist - as long as I can."
Gale,Now - even I am tired of the sound of my own voice. Let us venture forth.
Gale,I love you too. Much more than myself. More even than Mystra.
Gale,"Once I'd step out of the protective aura of the artefact, it wouldn't be long before the Absolute overtakes me. I'd never let that happen, so I'd aim for a swift end."
Gale,You know me. My gestures can never be grand enough.
Gale,"I would consume some Midnight Tears and venture as deep into the Underdark as I possibly could, until they cloud my eyes forever."
Gale,"It wouldn't be a heroic end, but coarsely poetic enough in its justice."
Gale,"I understand. I harbour you no ill will. In fact I enjoyed your company, even throughout this harrowing journey of ours."
Gale,"Right then. I do understand the rule about omelets and breaking eggs, but when there's more embryo than yolk involved... Well, ew."
Gale,"My tale is at an end, but yours is not. Beat that damn parasite in your head. Win the day and celebrate the nights. "
Gale,I know.
Gale,Every waking moment. Every dreaming moment too. But there was no way out.
Gale,"Perhaps that is what I deserve, but you deserve no such thing. To kill me is to unleash the orb."
Gale,"Rather worse, actually."
Gale,Very well. Whether I condemn this world or not: I choose you.
Gale,"Thankfully, the moment I absorbed the fragment wasn't enough to kill me outright. It was only the beginning."
Gale,What choice do I have? More than just a goddess counts on my courage: whole worlds hang in the balance.
Gale,But I can't... This is it. I must do as Mystra commands.
Gale,Look at that crown. It radiates with power unlike anything I've ever seen. To have it... to hold... If only I could...
Gale,"With a bit of luck I'd manage to make it to a mind flayer colony, so that when the orb erupts, one loud, last song of vengeance would reverberate through the dark."
Gale,"I'm sorry, but I had to remind you. After all, this is only the beginning."
Gale,And what of Lathander's faithful? Did the githyanki cut them down?
Gale,"It is fair to say her intimacy is not easily won. Nevertheless, I did."
Gale,"I am, after all, the villain of the tale."
Gale,"To end it... To struggle on... It is a grave choice you're making for us both, but if it must be so - very well, I'll stand down to stand by you."
Gale,"I... I have no desire to end your life, you know that."
Gale,Quite.
Gale,Netherese? These Chosen are powerful indeed to have such magic in their command. 
Gale,It was a fragment of primal Weave locked out of time - locked away from Mystra herself.
Gale,A mortal enchanted by the allures of the divine: is that not a tale as old as time? I merely happen to be one of its protagonists.
Gale,Suffice it to say I obtained an obscure and ancient book that had locked away inside a much-coveted prize:
Gale,I don't discredit my reasoning. Alas that my execution was rather less sound.
Gale,I was certain that this deed of raw power draped in romance would convince Mystra to take me by the hand and welcome me into her hitherto forbidden domains.
Gale,And still it gets worse...
Gale,I do trust you. More than myself right now. Perhaps even more than Mystra.
Gale,I don't think she's the type who hears 'no' very often...
Gale,Perhaps. But enticements beyond the perimeters of mortality are powerful motivators.
Gale,How generous of you - but perhaps you've forgotten we need it ourselves? That thing is keeping us safe.
Gale,"And if he does, he'll not find you alone."
Gale,Well this is new.
Gale,"Well, I suppose that explains why we don't often see eye-to-eye. Or tooth-to-fang, as is apparently the case."
Gale,By Mystra's silken tresses...
Gale,We are none of us monsters. We are merely hatcheries for monstrous things.
Gale,One last gust of Weave. One last gale to end them all.
Gale,Come now - I can see there's something on your mind.
Gale,Such was my skill that it earned me the attention of the mother of magic herself. The Lady of Mysteries. The goddess Mystra.
Gale,Netherese power like nothing anyone's seen in ages. They say magic led to the destruction of Netheril itself...
Gale,I was mistaken.
Gale,"All this time, I've been travelling with you despite the tadpole in your head."
Gale,I obtained the fabled book and took it into my study. As for what happened next...
Gale,Here. Place your hand over my heart. Let me show you.
Gale,"Though not, I think, my methods."
Halsin,It may be some time before you are afforded another such night - there is much to be done.
Halsin,"Be useful, won't you?"
Halsin,Good. Now our roots can deepen - together.
Halsin,I'll be ready.
Halsin,Quite a distraction...
Halsin,In the heat of battle? So be it.
Halsin,An unusual strategy.
Halsin,The Oak Father's work is never done.
Halsin,"With luck, and the Oak Father's blessings, we might actually survive. Are you ready?"
Halsin,There is a terrible curse surrounding Moonrise Towers - a shadow curse that drains away all light and life. 
Halsin,I must whisper.
Halsin,Speak to me.
Halsin,"Moonrise Towers beckons. I've told you all I know, and now I'll join your camp to help you face whatever's to come."
Halsin,"I trust you enjoyed your evening? After all your efforts, it was well-deserved."
Halsin,And you saw this boy yourself? That can't be a coincidence - but we need to be sure.
Halsin,I shall see it done.
Halsin,"Anyway, once the curse is lifted, nature can take its course without me. I belong at your side."
Halsin,I have. But perhaps there is more that I want... 
Halsin,"No, my friend. The only thing I ask of you is to allow me by your side on the road ahead. I still owe you a debt, and I intend to pay."
Halsin,"Still, I would like to return here some day. See Thaniel and Oliver again - in my meditations, or perhaps in person, if the Oak Father wills it. I hope he does."
Halsin,"I hope they will remain as a pair. It would be good for them both to have a friend, once I'm gone."
Halsin,"Once the curse is lifted, they can stand as one or as a pair. Whatever they wish."
Halsin,"No more than my right hand can absorb my left. Oliver is helping Thaniel to recover; they both lie dormant, like trees awaiting spring. "
Halsin,A friend is in need.
Halsin,"I can't say for certain, but we'll see it come to pass long before this place recedes behind us. Don't worry - all is at hand. We can depart whenever you're ready."
Halsin,I knew I could put my faith in you. If only we had met sooner.
Halsin,"Hold tight, my friend."
Halsin,Assistance is at hand.
Halsin,"Thaniel rests well. He's healing very rapidly, now that Oliver has returned to him."
Halsin,"By now, we should have seen some small glimmer of Thaniel's power - a sign that the land is healing. New growth, flowers in bloom. But there has been nothing."
Halsin,Have no fear.
Halsin,"I knew something was wrong when he didn't wake up, but now I'm even more certain."
Halsin,"Perhaps not - if he truly is a part of Thaniel, then he is beyond life and death. More likely he's just hiding. We should return to where you saw him."
Halsin,Aradin and his lot were looking for the same entrance - they sought an artefact called the Nightsong that was supposed to be housed somewhere down there.
Halsin,Whatever it takes.
Halsin,May nature cloak me.
Halsin,To battle.
Halsin,What a time for pilfering.
Halsin,I shall strike.
Halsin,"If you want me, I'm yours. Against the curse, against the Absolute - anything. Just say the word."
Halsin,"Perhaps it can be reasoned with, but I'm not hopeful. Reason is not something that thrives amidst the shadow curse."
Halsin,Fast and hard - leave it to me.
Halsin,My blood is up.
Halsin,"Let me help you then. Every moment counts, and I've asked much of you already without being at your side."
Halsin,To work.
Halsin,"Oak Father, preserve me."
Halsin,The Oak Father's work is never-ending.
Halsin,"And I'm glad to be had - glad to be with you, I mean."
Halsin,Do not falter. Victory looms.
Halsin,"Seems your ranks are quite packed. If some space frees up, I'll be ready for you."
Halsin,"Come on, get back in the fight!"
Halsin,Do not cost us this battle.
Halsin,"Come - one last push, my friend."
Halsin,Do not lose heart.
Halsin,Do not give up. We shall prevail.
Halsin,"Keep strong, for me."
Halsin,"Up! We shall carry the day, my friend."
Halsin,"We need you, my friend."
Halsin,I shall not abandon you.
Halsin,I am not your nursemaid.
Halsin,Victory shall yet be ours.
Halsin,"I believe if you find this entrance, you'll discover a route that leads to Moonrise Towers, bypassing the worst of the shadow curse. "
Halsin,"Come on! United, we cannot fail."
Halsin,"I am here for you, my friend."
Halsin,I should have allied myself with a boulder.
Halsin,"Come on, you useless turnip!"
Halsin,At least try and not be hindrance.
Halsin,"Oak Father, spare me useless allies..."
Halsin,"Stuck, eh? Straight out of bawdy literature."
Halsin,Shall we continue?
Halsin,"Nature stands with you, my friend."
Halsin,"No shame, my love. We have all been there."
Halsin,"Unseen, and ready."
Halsin,Oak Father's blessings.
Halsin,What is needed?
Halsin,Gently does it.
Halsin,Mmm-hmm?
Halsin,"I am stooped, but ready."
Halsin,Need to keep quiet.
Halsin,Every moment counts.
Halsin,There is a tunnel leading from the temple of Selûne right down into the Underdark and beyond. The entrance is hidden somewhere in the ruins.
Halsin,No time to waste.
Halsin,Let none impede me.
Halsin,Silvanus' blessings.
Halsin,What shall it be?
Halsin,There is much to do.
Halsin,Whatever shall it be?
Halsin,"Oak Father, watch over your servant."
Halsin,"Trapped, I see. Hold on, my love."
Halsin,"I can hardly leave you like this, can I?"
Halsin,I must act.
Halsin,"In a spot of bother, my love?"
Halsin,I shall soon have you free.
Halsin,Come  - do not miss our victory.
Halsin,"You are not bound by social niceties, I see. I like that. Perhaps I can show you just how much, another time."
Halsin,Both Orin and Gortash are slain. We shall rest well tonight.
Halsin,All the more potent now.
Halsin,I shall go there.
Halsin,There I shall go.
Halsin,Where to next...
Halsin,The horizon beckons.
Halsin,I shall get you in order.
Halsin,You need assistance.
Halsin,"Hardly worthy of help, but fine."
Halsin,"Not exactly a friend in need, but very well."
Halsin,"Fine, I shall help."
Halsin,In need of a hand?
Halsin,It shall be done - reluctantly.
Halsin,Is this what it has come to?
Halsin,Let me assist you.
Halsin,The prize is claimed.
Halsin,I shall go talk.
Halsin,What is to be had?
Halsin,All for the taking.
Halsin,A conversation is in order.
Halsin,What is to be found?
Halsin,A light touch pays off.
Halsin,"A word, then."
Halsin,Very good.
Halsin,I must seize every advantage.
Halsin,The lightest of touches...
Halsin,A successful pilfering.
Halsin,The way is clear.
Halsin,"A rich bounty, I hope."
Halsin,I shall go at once.
Halsin,Onwards.
Halsin,I see. It shall be done.
Halsin,I must be light of step.
Halsin,I need to get there - unseen.
Halsin,I shall get it done.
Halsin,Worry not.
Halsin,"Come on, let me help you."
Halsin,The battle is not yet won.
Halsin,I need no further prompting.
Halsin,"Have no fear, my heart."
Halsin,Hold on. I'm coming to help.
Halsin,It pains me to see you like this.
Halsin,Of course I shall help.
Halsin,"Allow me to help, please."
Halsin,"I shall set you right, love."
Halsin,"I am coming for you, my heart."
Halsin,What comes next?
Halsin,Let nature guide every step.
Halsin,"If you ever want to talk, my ears are all yours. Any part of me is yours, should you wish."
Halsin,"Worry not - I asked for freedom to follow my heart, and of course I offer it in return. There is so much to enjoy amidst nature's bounty - why squander what time we have on jealousy?"
Halsin,The path forward awaits.
Halsin,Oh. Then I'm sorry to hear the encounter left a sour taste in your mouth. It can be... an unfortunate reality. I just hope it doesn't dissuade you from exploring nature's bounty.
Halsin,"I just hope I don't seem boring to you now, in comparison. Perhaps I'll need to redouble my efforts, in future..."
Halsin,"Well, I'm glad you didn't feel the need to deprive yourself. To deny the most essential of impulses is to cut yourself off from nature."
Halsin,I can't help but sense a certain... ruefulness in you. Don't punish yourself on my account - remember we are both free to roam and love as we see fit.
Halsin,On I go.
Halsin,"Oak Father, lend my feet purpose."
Halsin,Light as a feather.
Halsin,"A word it shall be, then."
Halsin,Perhaps there is something to be gleaned.
Halsin,Hold on - help is coming.
Halsin,"Too much noise, too many lanterns kept burning... nature's rhythm is ignored here."
Halsin,I find it difficult to imagine that rest will come easily in such a place.
Halsin,"We end the day within the walls of the city, at last."
Halsin,At least this camp has bright-burning fires to stave off the shadows.
Halsin,"Just as foul a sight now as it was a century ago. Worse, even."
Halsin,None shall resist me.
Halsin,Being within reach of the shadow curse again is... troubling.
Halsin,...and certainly better than I did while languishing in the goblins' cages.
Halsin,I daresay I may rest more easily here than I did at the grove...
Halsin,"A fine respite from the world's troubles, this camp of yours."
Halsin,"Thaniel still suffers. There'll be no improvement until his essence is restored, I fear."
Halsin,"Bittersweet, that we had to leave Thaniel's realm so soon, after all that was done to save it. But it shall thrive in our absence, and now Baldur's Gate awaits."
Halsin,"But with the Oak Father's blessing, we may soon see it banished from these lands."
Halsin,The shadow curse is upon us. As foul as I remember it - perhaps even worse.
Halsin,"Whole generations were denied their chance to flourish. I must put this right, for them."
Halsin,"That is why it must be stopped. Imagine, a whole century of life and love, denied the chance to ever take place."
Halsin,This shall wreak some havoc.
Halsin,I shall do my utmost.
Halsin,But friendship is no consolation trophy. I cherish the bond we have forged. Whether it should grow into something else is not for me to predict.
Halsin,Woe betide my foes now.
Halsin,"Perhaps so, or perhaps not. I had wondered if I had detected something else once... but I must have been mistaken - my admiration for you, conflated with other feelings."
Halsin,A most lethal coating.
Halsin,And I am glad to be at your side. I just hope an old bear can prove to be of some service to you.
Halsin,"Who knows what awaits us in the city and beyond, but we shall face whatever may come as staunch allies and unwavering friends."
Halsin,A welcome advantage.
Halsin,Though perhaps we are not destined to share a campfire for much longer - a final reckoning surely looms.
Halsin,"Thaniel is back where he belongs, but there is more to be done."
Halsin,"At least he can rest, until the shadows are banished."
Halsin,I should have a word.
Halsin,"Let us speak, then."
Halsin,Woe betide any who stand against me.
Halsin,Gortash is no more. We have earned our rest on this eve.
Halsin,I must strike.
Halsin,Attack? Very well.
Halsin,"Trouble seems to seek you out, Minsc. I know the feeling - the larger you are, the more likely someone wishes to test themselves against you."
Halsin,"Perhaps you should study the druidic arts - with wildshape, you could make yourself as diminutive as you please. Smaller than Boo, even."
Halsin,Let nature's fury be unleashed.
Halsin,"Oak Father, guide my blow."
Halsin,"They may have their purposes. You could cast fireballs of sorts, without having to spend years studying magic tomes."
Halsin,Battle beckons.
Halsin,"Indeed, but we cannot yet say the same for you. I promised I would help you, and I intend to keep that promise, however I can."
Halsin,Consider the blow as good as struck.
Halsin,"Ketheric Thorm is the final obstacle. His demise shall unshackle nature, and banish the shadows."
Halsin,"And with Ketheric Thorm dead, the shadows he unleashed are soon to be gone."
Halsin,Thaniel and Oliver are reunited - nature's spirit is whole again.
Halsin,"The nighttime will feel more peaceful, knowing that Orin no longer skulks in the shadows."
Halsin,I should savour the sight of trees and grass while I can. Soon we shall be surrounded by cobbles and walls.
Halsin,"A curious place, this camp. One foot in nature, and the other in the city that awaits beyond."
Halsin,"I am blessed to have found your company, and share in your campfire."
Halsin,This will aid you.
Halsin,To rest beneath nature's canopy of stars - I can think of no finer way to pass the night.
Halsin,"Sterling progress, by anyone's measure."
Halsin,It shall be dealt with.
Halsin,"Gortash is no more, and we have not yet even reached the Lower City."
Halsin,Apologise for partaking in one of nature's most solemn rites? That squirrel should be glad to bear witness.
Halsin,Allow me to assist.
Halsin,An astral projection...? Cunning of her. Not to mention untrusting.
Halsin,May you share in nature's power.
Halsin,"No. At least, not right now."
Halsin,"Precisely! Who indeed? You do not know, and neither do any of the others."
Halsin,"A fellow druid. I can count on her to tend to the grove in my absence, help it heal."
Halsin,"She can tend to the grove, help it heal. In time, others will join. Perhaps some day I can return."
Halsin,Hopefully. I've chosen a successor as First Druid - Francesca of the High Forest. I sent a bird to summon her.
Halsin,...perhaps not. I do not know. All I can do for now is to try do some good where I can - try to help you.
Halsin,It is lost to me - lost to the world. Perhaps there'll be some way to unseal it in the future...
Halsin,"There'll be no firm answers until Moonrise Towers, I fear."
Halsin,I've inspected a tadpole up close and seen the effects of them on the Absolute's so-called 'True Souls.'
Halsin,"Hideous - but fascinating. Like nothing else in nature, I'm glad to say."
Halsin,"A drow attacked me and I defended myself. Afterwards, I was able to examine the tadpole that emerged."
Halsin,I studied one up close - closer than most would care to be to those things.
Halsin,Oak father's blessings to you.
Halsin,I fear not. The vapours in this alien cloaca are most bizarre.
Halsin,"We did the best we could, under dire circumstances. You would suggest otherwise?"
Halsin,"They say that history does not repeat, but it does rhyme, now and again. This is a rather unharmonious example."
Halsin,Like I said - unharmonious.
Halsin,Indeed. Though I wondered if you might have some empathy for him... both being former disciples of Shar.
Halsin,"Given your memory issues, perhaps a goldfish?"
Halsin,"Only the finest, of course."
Halsin,"I will not be taunted in this place - not after all it has taken from me. Show respect, or you will force my hand."
Halsin,"Once, certainly. But not for a hundred years. Any that still prowl this land can scarcely be called wolves any longer."
Halsin,Better than roses.
Halsin,Careful. The theft of the most important item in this place will surely not go unnoticed.
Halsin,"We must use every advantage, love."
Halsin,Just for you.
Halsin,"I need you strong, my love."
Halsin,"Rath has promise, but he's not ready yet. The grove needs experience and a strong hand."
Halsin,I would urge some caution. This honey pot is full of bees.
Halsin,I need her to stay focused on her training - the grove will need a skilled healer in my absence. 
Halsin,The grove needs to move beyond the mistakes of the past. What it needs is an unknown quantity; an outsider who can enforce the Oak Father's teachings without bias.
Halsin,"Fight on, my love."
Halsin,Cannot give up now.
Halsin,I studied the shadow curse for years. But to truly understand it - and stop it - I must reach its source.
Halsin,What Ketheric Thorm unleashed is not something that nature can undo by itself. I must do what I can.
Halsin,Well... there's hardly anyone left to share the responsibility with. Few who witnessed the fall of Moonrise still draw breath.
Halsin,"If I can join you and get close to Moonrise, perhaps I can lift this curse just as you find a cure for your infection."
Halsin,I helped overthrow Ketheric Thorm and his Dark Justiciars years ago. But I failed to prevent him from unleashing darkness across the region before he was defeated.
Halsin,There's also the shadow curse - it's an affront and must be cleansed.
Halsin,Those illithid creatures threaten the natural order - it's my duty to do what I can to stop them.
Halsin,"One of his cohorts, a dwarf called Brian, had a clue on his person. If you find his corpse in the goblins' camp, you may have a start."
Halsin,"Silvanus, guide my step."
Halsin,Aradin was convinced there was a hidden entrance in the temple of Selûne - I'd start there.
Halsin,"Precious little, but I'm quite certain it can still be found."
Halsin,"Tread carefully. You're on the right track, I'm sure - but there'll still be danger and difficulty before you reach Moonrise."
Halsin,"I'm certain. The Underdark is dangerous, yes, but the alternative is suicide. Be patient and be thorough - the path will reveal itself in time."
Halsin,"It may prove impossible to avoid the shadow curse entirely, but if you find any way to limit your exposure, seize it."
Halsin,"Keep looking. If they're present, then it's likely there's a route to Moonrise somewhere."
Halsin,That sounds like what you need. But the next part of the journey mightn't be straightforward - or safe.
Halsin,Impressive. Most would quake at the mere thought of delving that far into the Underdark. What did you find?
Halsin,"We have to get to Moonrise, but the less time we spend in its blighted surrounds, the better."
Halsin,"Those who remained are shadow-cursed. If you don't die at their hands, then you become one of them."
Halsin,It's had the whole region around Moonrise Towers in a chokehold of darkness and despair for years now.
Halsin,Indeed. 
Halsin,Resentment will spring up like mushrooms no matter what I do. You cannot please everyone and you'd be a fool to try.
Halsin,That is where I am needed.
Halsin,"Contrary to how some think of us, we druids can play politics when necessary."
Halsin,This is why I chose Francesca. She will restore simplicity and purity to the grove in my absence.
Halsin,If only everyone said that.
Halsin,"His strength is coming back to him. Soon he'll be able to banish the curse once and for all. Until then, we should do what we can to stop the Absolute."
Halsin,"A little boost, my love."
Halsin,"Let me work my magic, love."
Halsin,"Be glad it did, or you'd be a True Soul by now. <br>"
Halsin,"It's immensely powerful, whatever it is - strong enough to slow ceremorphosis to a crawl. Luckily, that gives you more time."
Halsin,"Precisely. If we can understand just what this magic is, then perhaps we can rid you of this parasite."
Halsin,"That place is where the cultists send their captives. Innocents go in, True Souls come out. It has to be the source of this magic."
Halsin,Your resolve is most admirable. It'll serve you well for where you've to go - Moonrise Towers.
Halsin,"But I'm afraid it won't be easy, or quick."
Halsin,And I may be able to help you find a more definitive solution to your problem.
Halsin,I'd still be target practice for goblins if you hadn't come along. I think I can trust you.
Halsin,That sounds... novel. What is it that protects you?
Halsin,I was right to seek you out. You're after a cure for this parasite.
Halsin,All too well - I could even sense it from afar. Now let me confirm it; I need to know exactly what we're dealing with... 
Halsin,I'm here for you. I believe I can help with the parasite lurking within.
Halsin,"Looking for you, of course. We have work to do."
Halsin,"Thank you. I will grieve when I can, but for now, I must find another way to serve nature - by helping you."
Halsin,I sensed what was done to you from afar. Now let me confirm it; I need to know exactly what we're dealing with... 
Halsin,I know. It's what brings me here.
Halsin,This will bolster you.
Halsin,"Or I was, at least. I went there - the grove is sealed off to me, to the whole world."
Halsin,"I am Halsin, First Druid of the Emerald Grove."
Halsin,"Don't worry, I'm not here just to sing your praises. I believe I can help - with your tadpole."
Halsin,"If you hadn't killed the leaders of that goblin horde, the grove would be no more. I am in your debt."
Halsin,"I am Halsin, First Druid of the Emerald Grove - and I owe you my thanks."
Halsin,"If you hadn't seen to the leaders of that goblin horde, the grove would be no more. I am in your debt."
Halsin,"It is sealed off to me, to the whole world. Forever, perhaps."
Halsin,"I have nowhere else to turn, it seems. I went to the grove, but... I cannot face what has happened there."
Halsin,"By all means - pursue any leads you may have. But I sense all roads will lead to Moonrise, in the end."
Halsin,I've long sought to return to Moonrise Towers - unfinished business. It seems our fates have aligned.
Halsin,"And where do you suppose that ship was taking you? Moonrise, I'll wager. The journey differs, but the problem is the same."
Halsin,You need this.
Halsin,"If we can get to Moonrise and understand just what this magic is, then perhaps we can rid you of this parasite."
Halsin,I may be able to help you find a more definitive solution to your problem.
Halsin,Let none stand in our way.
Halsin,I have nature's fury at my back.
Halsin,"We shall win this, my love."
Halsin,A fine camp you have here. Certainly an improvement on that filthy cage the goblins had me in.
Halsin,A fine camp you have here. My apologies for showing up unannounced.
Halsin,"My thanks again, for all you did. With the grove safe, I am free to turn to other matters."
Halsin,I owe you a debt for seeing to the goblins' leaders. Now I'm here to pay that debt.
Halsin,I heard how you saved the grove; it wouldn't be right for me to let you leave without expressing my gratitude.
Halsin,The path is now clear - we have to get to Moonrise Towers. Do you remember what I told you? About getting there?
Halsin,"Indeed, and may the Oak Father watch over us on our journey. We will speak soon, I'm sure."
Halsin,"I will join you, help you with that which plagues you. The illithid curse is a blight to all nature."
Halsin,"There is hope... but it isn't found here, at my hands - at least not yet."
Halsin,Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies - Moonrise Towers.
Halsin,"It's the source of this magic, and where the cultists send their captives - to be infected. They're building an army. Innocents go in, True Souls come out."
Halsin,"Luckily, you have time - this magic has slowed your ceremorphosis to a crawl. I just can't fathom why someone would do that."
Halsin,"An ancient citadel, abandoned for years - and for very good reason - until these cultists took it over."
Halsin,Apart from facing legions of Absolute followers? The whole region is shrouded in a curse - a shadow curse.
Halsin,"For years now, this curse has consumed all light and life. It spits out only darkness and despair."
Halsin,Few survive long - those who do are transformed by the curse. It is not a place to venture into lightly.
Halsin,I thought you'd help me. I thought we'd help each other. Instead you chose this.
Halsin,You have upended nature's balance. Only your death can restore it.
Halsin,There's nothing left to be said. My mercy died when I saw the grove.
Halsin,There's always a choice - but you made yours. Now I make mine.
Halsin,"You have no idea what you've done, do you? Or perhaps you simply don't care? "
Halsin,Tell me... was it worth it?
Halsin,"When I met you, I thought we were destined to be allies. But you made that impossible."
Halsin,"Don't be coy - I can sense the imbalance in you. Now let me confirm it, so I can be certain of what we're dealing with..."
Halsin,Hmm. Sometimes a mysterious cure is worse than the disease.
Halsin,This will help you.
Halsin,"He's still fighting. The curse hasn't won yet, but he'll need our help if he's to recover."
Halsin,Moving to position.
Halsin,What were you expecting? That I'd mumble a spell or whip out a potion?
Halsin,"In fact, I saw just the sort before, not long after we first came within reach of the shadow curse. Fool that I am, I did not grasp their significance at the time."
Halsin,"Look for signs of life in the darkness. Wildflowers, where everything else is dead. The curse cannot subdue the power Thaniel bears. Not entirely."
Halsin,"No matter how it's been twisted by the shadows, it is still part of Thaniel's essence - it will resemble him somehow, and may show signs of his power."
Halsin,"Take heart, my friend."
Halsin,"Only, the missing half may not come willingly. The curse will have sunk its tendrils deep, twisting Thaniel's essence into something... else."
Halsin,"Perhaps - if we can find Thaniel's lost half, and make him whole again."
Halsin,"It's both simple and not - we need to find Thaniel's missing half, and make him whole again. "
Halsin,"What stayed behind would have been the strongest part of him, but after all these years left in darkness, corruption must have taken hold."
Halsin,"The shadows rended him in two when they bore him away to the Shadowfell. Half of his essence remained here, amidst the curse. "
Halsin,Thaniel is resting - but it's no easy slumber. I discovered what's wrong with him.
Halsin,You wish to speak?
Halsin,I swear I can already feel a change in the air - like the curse itself knows its time is short.
Halsin,We need to find Oliver and get him to return to Thaniel. Otherwise this curse will never be lifted.
Halsin,"A haunting has come upon you, but the first step is this admission you have now made. You will not walk alone into this night, remember that."
Halsin,"If I had my fleet of druids and a month of hard research, perhaps I could help. But I'm no savant, for now I can only guarantee a cure for ceremorphosis."
Halsin,"The Oak Father must have blessed you to make it this far, or another eye above."
Halsin,Good lad. You're tougher than Blackwood.
Halsin,Good lass. You're tougher than Blackwood.
Halsin,"I believe you when you tell me that your symptoms do not wholly align with the makings of the parasite. But until we remove it, I doubt we will be able to isolate the rest of your troubles."
Halsin,"Do I note some trepidation? Spirits are but echoes of nature's cycle. Most give no cause to elicit fear... most, but not all."
Halsin,"I am here to be your ear, as you bear your burdens, and the arms that protect you, if you can shoulder them no more."
Halsin,"Everything in your mind has been destroyed, from what I gathered. And from the path I see you on, you are doing well at picking up the pieces."
Halsin,"Is that so? Well, nature does abhor waste... I will keep watch, thank you. I had a feeling time in your company would prove fruitful."
Halsin,"That is a truth that can evade minds far older than yours, Wyll. You are wise beyond your years."
Halsin,Of course. Whatever you wish.
Halsin,A bad impression? Impossible.
Halsin,"There is a ruin, some way outside of Last Light. I caught a glimpse of fresh blooms there, but did not investigate further. I shall mark it upon your map."
Halsin,"I was. Part of my spirit was shorn away from me here, and never left."
Halsin,I won't be held accountable just because you're naive enough to expect easy answers. Now allow me to continue.
Halsin,Wait. There's more you need to know.
Halsin,You could use this.
Halsin,This will provide a lift.
Halsin,"Allow me, my friend."
Halsin,"Onward then. We'll speak soon, I'm sure."
Halsin,"This doesn't have to be your burden alone. Every moment counts, and I've asked much of you already without being at your side."
Halsin,"It may be some time before you are afforded another such night - there is much to be done, and I promised I would help you however I could."
Halsin,"I'm certain a cure for you can be found at Moonrise Towers, but it's... complicated."
Halsin,"The journey, specifically - it's extremely perilous. Though it seems you're well accustomed to navigating danger."
Halsin,"This curse shrouds everything in shadow - you will not find life, light or anything natural there."
Halsin,"You're half-right - you have to get to Moonrise, but you still have a choice of how to get there."
Halsin,"If you can find this place, I'll wager it will reveal a more direct path to Moonrise Towers, and may even bypass the worst of the shadow curse."
Halsin,"I would like to join your camp, if you'll allow me. I can offer my skills, my counsel."
Halsin,I've long sought to return to Moonrise Towers. It seems our fates have aligned.
Halsin,"I advise you start in the temple of Selûne - if you find the Dark Justiciars' hidden entrance, it could lead you all the way to Moonrise."
Halsin,May Silvanus guide us.
Halsin,"Unfinished business, and a lifetime of regret to repair."
Halsin,"If I can join you and get close to Moonrise, perhaps I can lift this curse, same as you may find a cure for your infection."
Halsin,"It's lost to me. Perhaps in time I can open it up to the world again, but for now, I must help you."
Halsin,I've chosen a successor as First Druid - Francesca of the High Forest. A bird's already been dispatched to summon her.
Halsin,A fellow druid. I can count on her to tend to the grove in my absence. Help it heal.
Halsin,"Rath has promise, but he has a ways to go yet. He wasn't able to stop Kagha by himself. The grove needs experience and a strong hand."
Halsin,I must get into position.
Halsin,"Silvanus, banish all wounds."
Halsin,"Now, we've quite the journey ahead. Best get started."
Halsin,Indeed. We've quite the journey ahead of us.
Halsin,Stay strong - I need you.
Halsin,You'll need to pick up where Aradin left off - find the hidden entrance. It's somewhere in the temple of Selûne.
Halsin,"What, were you expecting a spell? A potion? Or perhaps you thought I'd conduct a cack-handed operation on you right here."
Halsin,Many who deserved an honourable burial had to be abandoned. The shadow curse inspired great haste.
Halsin,Perhaps... but best to not dwell on nights past. There are plenty more yet to come.
Halsin,"Pilfering it is, then."
Halsin,Miss it? Oh dear no. It's a terrible burden; takes you away from nature and forces you to deal with others' problems and personalities.
Halsin,On the move.
Halsin,"A dwarf called Brian, I believe. Though there's no guarantee that the goblins left him recognisable."
Halsin,I must not stop.
Halsin,I see. At once.
Halsin,"Oak Father, guide me."
Halsin,Must keep going.
Halsin,One of those who died had a clue that was supposed to help us find the hidden entrance to the Underdark.
Halsin,"But in my eagerness, I put far too much faith in the abilities of Aradin and his band. We didn't even get close."
Halsin,I cannot falter.
Halsin,Precisely. Then perhaps I could have done something about both the shadow curse and ceremorphosis aberrations.
Halsin,Put it from your mind for now. Once we near the curse - then there will be more to be said.
Halsin,"Perhaps, but we'll need to get closer before I can put my theory into practice."
Halsin,"...But since the curse was unleashed, I have not felt his presence. He is its prisoner, I fear. And as long as he remains so, his domain will lie in darkness."
Halsin,"This land is more than just soil and rock, root and leaf... it is a living being, in the form of a young fey boy, with the forest itself in his eyes. His name is Thaniel - I've met him, in my meditations. "
Halsin,"Oak Father shield you, my friend."
Halsin,"Don't worry - if you find something, you will know it."
Halsin,"I can't be exact, unfortunately. Time and the shadow curse won't have been kind to any traces that would have been left behind."
Halsin,"But if we can find him, we can break the curse. If you learn anything of the Shadowfell, or of a boy with the forest in his eyes, find me at once."
Halsin,"We must find Thaniel. He is the embodiment of nature's power, but... but he is just a child. A child who has been trapped in this place for a hundred years."
Halsin,"Accept nature's healing, my friend."
Halsin,I will go to see him at once. Join me when you can.
Halsin,"Thaniel is no ordinary child - he is the very spirit of this land. If this Fist knows where he is, then perhaps we can save him... save everything."
Halsin,"Perhaps there's still a way to learn something from him - the dead can't deny their knowledge, if asked the right question."
Halsin,"Poor soul... but in truth, if I had to choose between death and the Shadowfell, I'd choose death."
Halsin,What comes next will prove dangerous. Meet me by the shore outside Last Light - we can do our work there without imperilling others.
Halsin,"Good - this is what we've been lacking. Now there's a chance we can find Thaniel, and bring him home."
Halsin,I must reach there.
Halsin,No time to spare.
Halsin,I'm just glad to be out here amidst the Oak Father's creations.
Halsin,I'd rather the shadow curse didn't linger just beyond the campfire... but your company more than makes up for it.
Halsin,Surely none but a boiled turnip would trust the likes of him.
Halsin,"In other circumstances, I would have done the same."
Halsin,Let me see what can be taken.
Halsin,There are few things that are too strong for me. And cast those regrets aside; you did not get caught up in the moment - you seized it.
Halsin,"I'm sure something will come to me, given time."
Halsin,Is such an existence lacking?
Halsin,"I'll miss my books, but I can find all the wisdom they contain out here, first-hand."
Halsin,"Wonderfully! If I'm honest, the grove was too comfortable for my tastes; I felt removed from nature."
Halsin,With such stimulating company? Never better.
Halsin,Prudent. But I hope we won't have to contend with the perils of the curse for long. There's more to living than just survival. Much more.
Halsin,"But... if I succeed, if I break the curse, then perhaps there will be time for myself again. And for others."
Halsin,"I can think of a thing or two... but in truth, it is for the best that the curse consumes my thoughts for now. This is the best chance I've had in a century - I cannot squander it."
Halsin,More good has been done since I met you than in a hundred years before. Words cannot express my gratitude.
Halsin,A little reinvigoration is in order.
Halsin,"It is most unfair to pour such scorn on rats - they have their place in nature, same as you or I. "
Halsin,You're too modest by far. What fate would I have met without you? Rotting in the goblins' cells? Dying against an onslaught on the Grove?
Halsin,"...Forgive me. Sometimes I forget myself, gazing on the beauty of nature's creations."
Halsin,Yes. I think you do...
Halsin,Perhaps if I manage to break the curse... perhaps then I can show you just how grateful I am.
Halsin,"I can think of a thing or two... but the curse grips my mind for now, and I would loathe to give you only part of my attention."
Halsin,"A light step, and a lighter touch."
Halsin,"I wish I could have found another fate for the Grove, but I appreciate all you have done for me nonetheless."
Halsin,I can only imagine what fate would I have met without you -rotting in the goblins' cells? Being sealed away by the Rite of Thorns for all eternity?
Halsin,A light touch is in order.
Halsin,Gently does it...
Halsin,"You've shared your fire with me, your company. A small pocket of light against the darkness, but one I couldn't do without. Thank you."
Halsin,"It's not easy, seeing the ravages of the shadow curse... but your camp is a most welcome solace."
Halsin,Let me see what I can claim.
Halsin,Deftness is called for.
Halsin,Low and quiet.
Halsin,It allowed me to see you. Truly see you. I have lived a very long time. I have taken many lovers. My heart does not stir lightly. But it does now.
Halsin,There? Very well.
Halsin,I shall see you on your feet again.
Halsin,"At least you were not present. Grim as it is now, it was worse on the day of the battle. A vivid wound upon my memory."
Halsin,"I cannot leave you like this, love."
Halsin,"I shall help, my love."
Halsin,Battle is afoot - you can poke me once we are safe.
Halsin,Perhaps try attacking the enemy?
Halsin,"Admirable stamina, yet terrible priorities."
Halsin,"You are insistent, are you not?"
Halsin,"Up to me to help, of course..."
Halsin,Show more care in future.
Halsin,"Hardly deserving of aid, but very well."
Halsin,Not a task I relish...
Halsin,"It must be done, I suppose."
Halsin,Do not make a habit of this.
Halsin,Help is coming. Even if undeserved...
Halsin,"In nature, you would be left to fend for yourself..."
Halsin,Up! Make yourself useful!
Halsin,"Damn you, do not cost us victory!"
Halsin,This is no time for slacking.
Halsin,"Come on, up!"
Halsin,I am not your servant.
Halsin,I am not here just to help you.
Halsin,This is no time for weakness.
Halsin,"Oak Father, what did I do to deserve such allies?"
Halsin,"Keep up, will you?"
Halsin,"I was lucky - I lived, when so many did not. It would take me a day and a night to recite the names of all the friends I lost."
Halsin,"Oak Father, grant me patience."
Halsin,"Hold on, my friend."
Halsin,Whatever I can do to help.
Halsin,"You may thrive, but what of other life? A city is no place for wild creatures."
Halsin,"Brickwork and stonework - this place is far out of balance with nature. But the Oak Father will reclaim this all, eventually."
Halsin,"I doubt many will seek to surrender. But if they do... mercu costs us nothing, Karlach."
Halsin,"Oh no, perish the thought. That can be outright cruel advice to offer in certain cases."
Halsin,Dispensing advice on matters of the heart would be like swapping boots - what suits me may be a poor fit for you.
Halsin,Perhaps I can yet turn hindsight into foresight - provided the curse is lifted. A better way for all.
Halsin,"To think, long ago, the druids feared this market town would grow into a city, and threaten nature's realm... little did we realise what the true threat was."
Halsin,"Peace and rest are strangers in these lands, until the shadows are banished."
Halsin,"Normally such sounds would be most welcome, but perhaps not right now..."
Halsin,"Yes, you are right. He is one sort I would rather seal away forever, to prevent his rot from causing any further harm."
Halsin,To seal away that which a person no longer needs is to lessen the Oak Father's bounty for all.
Halsin,"Do not worry, I am here."
Halsin,"Allow me, please."
Halsin,"I never favoured tombs - nothing but vanity. Upon death, mortal remains should be returned to nature, to nourish and replenish itself."
Halsin,"Flaming Fists, Harpers, refugees, perhaps... The shadow curse has indiscriminate taste in victims."
Halsin,"Still though, when you are expecting nothing but desolation, even a small glimmer of hope fills the heart."
Halsin,"Last Light Inn - hearth aglow and lanterns lit, just like a hundred years ago!"
Halsin,"I... I suppose it is, yes. But perhaps do not refer to her as such - she is a vengeful, capricious goddess. Who knows what may cause her ire."
Halsin,"What do you know of Umberlee, Astarion?"
Halsin,Jest all you will. I believe now in your honest heart.
Halsin,"Astarion, I am astonished. To relish in intimacy again after such hardship is a wound many never recover from."
Halsin,"For your sake, I hope some of it is just a fantasy, deep in your heart."
Halsin,"To give oneself wholly, and to have a lover totally in your thrall...? A harmless game, until it becomes real. I worry for the two of you, Astarion."
Halsin,Clandestine aid is on the way.
Halsin,"Then let it brew. Some radical thinkers claim that peace is a valid option, you know."
Halsin,I am here to help.
Halsin,"Do not be a liability, please!"
Halsin,"Oak Father, guide my hand."
Halsin,All shall fall before nature's fury.
Halsin,"Now, what shall I find?"
Halsin,"I shall help you, my love."
Halsin,"You are wounded, my heart."
Halsin,"Fret not, you shall soon be back to health."
Halsin,I shall tend to you. Worry not.
Halsin,"I shall restore you, my love."
Halsin,"I am coming for you, my love."
Halsin,Allow me to salve you.
Halsin,I fight for the Oak Father's realm.
Halsin,The power of the bear lies within me.
Halsin,"Silvanus, let me strike true."
Halsin,"Yield, or die."
Halsin,I shall see you laid low.
Halsin,Some rejuvenation is in order.
Halsin,"Oak Father, let me heal all."
Halsin,In need of aid?
Halsin,To your health.
Halsin,This shall help.
Halsin,"Oak Father, give me your strength."
Halsin,"A helping hand, perhaps?"
Halsin,I shall assist.
Halsin,Help is coming.
Halsin,Let every enemy of nature fall.
Halsin,Someone in need.
Halsin,Help is called for.
Halsin,What lies within?
Halsin,Something to be discovered?
Halsin,"Hmm, what is to be found?"
Halsin,I shall take a look.
Halsin,Let stealth be my weapon.
Halsin,The worms shall feast on nature's foes.
Halsin,I shall die before I yield.
Halsin,I shall prevail.
Halsin,I must protect the Oak Father's realm.
Halsin,I shall see this battle won.
Halsin,"Oak Father, I fight for you."
Halsin,Nature's strength lies within me.
Halsin,I shall not relent.
Halsin,Let nature's enemies lie broken.
Halsin,"The Oak Father watches, always."
Halsin,I stand to serve nature.
Halsin,"Ah, a glimpse of nature. Like a sip of water to parched lips, eh, Jaheira?"
Halsin,What is to be done?
Halsin,I am here.
Halsin,What comes now?
Halsin,"Silvanus, bless me."
Halsin,Nature shall prevail.
Halsin,There are no mistakes in nature. Only hidden purpose.
Halsin,I am prepared.
Halsin,Is something afoot?
Halsin,There is much to be done.
Halsin,The Oak Father compels me.
Halsin,"I am ready, whatever may come."
Halsin,What is it to be?
Halsin,Every day in nature's service is a gift.
Halsin,The Oak Father's bidding shall be done.
Halsin,I think on them also. But nothing matches the splendour of an ancient tree.
Halsin,"You and I may struggle to go unnoticed in such environs, Karlach."
Halsin,"I meant more in terms of size. Folk of our stature can be a lure for drunkards seeking a brawl, I have found."
Halsin,"Scant few times I've seen youthful partnerships end well, but if anyone was formed to thrive in one, I think it may be you."
Halsin,"Very quick to say 'forever' to your newly betrothed, weren't you, Blade?"
Halsin,Take your time. I'll be waiting.
Halsin,"Besides, a large-enough pack of scavengers can take down even the strongest of bears."
Halsin,"Poor choice of companions, for one thing - gladly rectified, since then. "
Halsin,I am loathe to see anyone behind bars. It reminds me of my time as a guest of the goblins.
Halsin,"Are you sure you wish to end the affair so... coldly? Perhaps if you speak to him, he may show an open mind."
Halsin,"When you care about something deeply enough, it consumes every thought and word."
Halsin,"A shrine of Selûne, tucked away like an unsprouted seed."
Halsin,"I need to stay true to my nature, and you to yours. Perhaps you are like me, or perhaps not."
Halsin,"It has its place, but it is not for me. The wolf mates for life, but the bear roams free and partners as its instinct dictates."
Halsin,"After the shadow curse, I became overly fond of honey mead and melancholy evenings by myself. Now I rarely imbibe - only on the most special of occasions."
Halsin,"The scent of hops and barley is most persistent here, even after all this time."
Halsin,"Some treat their relationships like a walled garden - tidy, tamed, cut off from the world. That is their right, but it is not for me. I do as nature does, and let my heart run wild. Desire flourishes wherever it finds purchase."
Halsin,"But know that if you are open to it, I will not demand commitment of you. Your heart is your own - I just want to share in it."
Halsin,"Not so, in my experience. There is little I cannot whittle."
Halsin,The birthing ground of those steel monstrosities. I would feel little sorrow if this place should close forever.
Halsin,"I understand. If that is where the matter ends, so be it."
Halsin,You sound like a student - reciting words for a test without considering their meaning.
Halsin,Shar's armies of destruction arose from within these halls.
Halsin,"True. But you are among friends. Whatever lies ahead, we shall face it together."
Halsin,"I daresay you are no longer comfortable in this place, Shadowheart."
Halsin,"You have bonded with Karlach, body and soul. Her scent lingers on your skin. If there is to be anything between us, it must be with her consent. And perhaps some day, her participation."
Halsin,You bleat well enough as it is.
Halsin,"Once, you could hear nature's symphony in this place. Now it is quiet. Quiet and dead."
Halsin,"Are you sure you wish to end the affair so... coldly? Perhaps if you speak to her, she may show an open mind."
Halsin,So many unfortunates must have been infected in this place. Imagine the horrors...
Halsin,"Are you sure you wish to end the affair so... coldly? Perhaps if you asked, you may find your lover has an open mind."
Halsin,I was concerned perhaps my imagination was playing tricks on me - my stomach was in knots like some lovelorn ninety-year-old.
Halsin,I already knew I had found a strong ally in you - but now I see I have been blessed with a true friend also.
Halsin,"I thought you might, but it still warms my heart to hear you say it."
Halsin,"Ha! I am honoured to be your beast of burden, then."
Halsin,"I did not wish for another day to end without telling you how I felt, and now I have done so. Rest well, and thank you once again."
Halsin,"I see... well, perhaps not all friendships are destined to be balanced and reciprocal. But I remain eternally grateful for having met you, all the same. Rest well."
Halsin,"Ha! I suppose I did, didn't I? I was so focused on helping Thaniel that my sense of decorum was neglected.<br>"
Halsin,I shall endeavour to be more tactful when trying to make friends in future.
Halsin,"I believe so. Perhaps in another life, we would have felt something more stir between us... but that was not meant to be.<br>"
Halsin,"The bond we share remains deeply precious to me, all the same."
Halsin,I want to be more than that to you. I have lived a very long time. I have taken many lovers. My heart does not stir lightly. But it does now.
Halsin,"Truly? I thought you felt the same way as me. There was a connection, I was sure."
Halsin,"But I respect your choice, if that's how you truly feel. Your friendship remains precious to me."
Halsin,"You have bonded with Astarion, body and soul. His scent lingers on your skin. If there is to be anything between us, it must be with his consent. And perhaps some day, his participation."
Halsin,"Truly? I was sure there was a connection, ever since we celebrated after you saved the grove."
Halsin,"Truly? I thought you felt the same as I did - you saw to my needs here in camp with the care of a lover, not a host."
Halsin,"Truly? I was sure we had a connection - you seemed more than a little curious about my current love life, for one."
Halsin,"So, I am not bound to nature. I am unbound in nature."
Halsin,And I've been to the Underdark. Many times.
Halsin,"Like I said, I've lived a long time, travelled far and wide. I've lain with elf maidens under the boughs of oaks. I've had a Nelanther pirate claw my back and cry my name until he was hoarse."
Halsin,"I welcome all of nature's blessings, whether they come to me one at a time, or in multitudes. There is no shame in it."
Halsin,I think you feel the same way. The connection is... palpable.
Halsin,Gortash will be keen to hear of this.
Halsin,Only one Chosen remains. For now.
Halsin,I shall handle this.
Halsin,A simple 'no' would have sufficed. I will trouble you with the matter no more.
Halsin,"I will not ask you to dedicate yourself to me. I roam as nature wills me to, and your heart remains your own. I just wish to share in it."
Halsin,"Truly? I was sure you felt the same way. Once the power of the shadow curse was broken, the connection was undeniable."
Halsin,Every enemy of nature must fall.
Halsin,"More disappointed, I would say.<br>"
Halsin,"You have bonded with Lae'zel, body and soul. Her scent lingers on your skin. If there is to be anything between us, it must be with her consent. And perhaps some day, her participation."
Halsin,I am... less anxious to find myself in a city. So removed from nature's power - I do not know how I will fare.
Halsin,"I cannot leave you in this state, love."
Halsin,Let me get you back in order.
Halsin,I will not leave you like this.
Halsin,"You can rely on me, my heart."
Halsin,"Worry not, my love."
Halsin,I shall not give up on you that easily.
Halsin,"We have lifted the shadow curse, but a new challenge awaits us."
Halsin,I make no apologies for knowing what is important to me.
Halsin,I can only hope we still find time to vanquish the curse. I can think of little else.
Halsin,"I want more than to fight at your side, or sit around the campfire with you. I want to lay with you under the stars and feel your skin against mine."
Halsin,"A council of intellectuals, respected throughout Faerûn - leading authorities on heraldry of course, but also history, genealogy, and diplomacy."
Halsin,"This fortress was a seat of the High Heralds, I believe. Long gone from here, of course. "
Halsin,I have lived a very long time. I have taken many lovers. My heart does not stir lightly. But it does now.
Halsin,I don't discriminate against any type.
Halsin,"I knew one of Reithwin's head masons. She was a good woman, and strong as an ox."
Halsin,You're too modest. I wager you don't even know how extraordinary you truly are. But I do.
Halsin,"...I was forgetting who I was, but you lifted the fog. Thank you."
Halsin,"I never quite realised how burdened I was, until I met you. The threat of the shadow curse, the politics of the grove..."
Halsin,"They forget how much I study, meditate, and as a bear - hibernate. I must have spent a hundred years or more asleep."
Halsin,"Hailing from the Underdark can dampen one's sense of fun, I will admit. Down there, noises such as laughter tend to attract predators."
Halsin,"There is an admirable harmony to the Society of Brilliance. Beings of all sorts, united in the pursuit of intellect..."
Halsin,We are. Yet there is a burden to being the survivor... the witness to others' tragedies. It only grows heavier with time.
Halsin,"All gone... devoured by the shadows. Oak Father preserve us, it's just like a hundred years ago."
Halsin,A few. But people always warm to the most salacious chapters. 
Halsin,This will leave a mark.
Halsin,This shall prove fearsome in battle.
Halsin,Better be careful where I point this...
Halsin,A little extra bite.
Halsin,"You have bonded with Gale, body and soul. His scent lingers on your skin. If there is to be anything between us, it must be with his consent. And perhaps some day, his participation."
Halsin,"You know, if you and your love ever wish to enjoy the waters with me, I could attempt a kelpie... or even a porpoise."
Halsin,"I heard you learnt how to swim, Shadowheart - well done."
Halsin,"You have bonded with Shadowheart, body and soul. Her scent lingers on your skin. If there is to be anything between us, it must be with her consent. And perhaps some day, her participation."
Halsin,"True... but only until the thaw, then life goes on. This gold may never see daylight again, while others go cold and hungry."
Halsin,Such hoarding of wealth. A tomb for riches that could be put to better use.
Halsin,"You have bonded with Wyll, body and soul. His scent lingers on your skin. If there is to be anything between us, it must be with his consent. And perhaps some day, his participation."
Halsin,"Danger, going by past experience. A cursed tome. An unstable spell. A haunted poppet..."
Halsin,"This place reminds me of a magpie's nest. Random baubles, doodahs, and what-have-yous, all jumbled together without a care."
Halsin,"But tell me I'm wrong, and the matter can rest. I do not wish to sour our friendship, but I have to know if it can be something more."
Halsin,I think you feel the same way. Do you remember the celebrations after you saved the grove? There was a connection.
Halsin,I was concerned that your pursuit of a cure might cloud your final days. I am glad I was wrong.
Halsin,"I heard what took place at Selûne's shrine, Shadowheart. Was such defilement truly necessary?"
Halsin,"Nature affords us few greater powers of healing than what love can provide, Karlach."
Halsin,"Indeed. But I just wanted to take the chance to say - it has been a pleasure, Karlach."
Halsin,I cannot help but feel that destiny is tightening its grip on our forward path.
Halsin,"I think you feel the same way - you saw to my needs here in camp with the care of a lover, not a host."
Halsin,I think you feel the same way - why else would you have been so concerned about whether I had a lover before?
Halsin,Let me see to that.
Halsin,Make some effort.
Halsin,Do not go soft on me now!
Halsin,"Keep it up, damn you!"
Halsin,Do not squander this.
Halsin,Come on!
Halsin,Stand up for yourself.
Halsin,A welcome edge.
Halsin,"I think you feel the same way. Once the power of the shadow curse was broken, the connection was undeniable. We both felt it."
Halsin,There? Of course.
Halsin,This will help.
Halsin,You need aid.
Halsin,Allow me to bolster you.
Halsin,"Do what you must, Gale. Mystra has weighed upon your heart and mind for too long."
Halsin,"May I be unseen, like nature's smallest creatures."
Halsin,Time to conceal myself.
Halsin,Unseen. Nature shields me.
Halsin,I must hide.
Halsin,I am coming for you.
Halsin,You are needed.
Halsin,We need you in the fight.
Halsin,This is  not over yet.
Halsin,I am here for you.
Halsin,Hold on.
Halsin,Keep strong.
Halsin,May the carrion birds grow fat on you.
Halsin,I must be without mercy.
Halsin,Hmm. A challenging sum. The chimera has three heads... but does it still count as one?
Halsin,Kill... yes.
Halsin,I need you strong.
Halsin,"Please, let me help."
Halsin,I must be as the snake - low and quiet.
Halsin,"Speak your mind, Gale. Let go of that weight you have been carrying for Mystra."
Halsin,"Please, you need this."
Halsin,Down I go...
Halsin,Do not squander this aid.
Halsin,I had better help.
Halsin,"Let me aid you, ,my heart."
Halsin,We shall carry the day.
Halsin,I shall aid you.
Halsin,"You need this, my love."
Halsin,"Of course, it had to be you."
Halsin,"Not very self-reliant, are you?"
Halsin,Scarcely worth the effort.
Halsin,Stealth is in order.
Halsin,"Oak Father, let me go unnoticed."
Halsin,Quite a bulk to conceal...
Halsin,I shall avoid every gaze.
Halsin,Allow me to speak.
Halsin,"Of course, my heart."
Halsin,Whatever you wish.
Halsin,"Of course, my love."
Halsin,Let me see to that for you.
Halsin,Whatever you need.
Halsin,"At once, my love."
Halsin,You wish me to go speak? Of course.
Halsin,Of course. Though I'd rather be speaking to you...
Halsin,I shall see to it.
Halsin,What do we have here?
Halsin,I shall investigate.
Halsin,Let me see...
Halsin,We're all in one piece. Perhaps you'll join us next time.
Halsin,Better see to this.
Halsin,"Worth a look, perhaps."
Halsin,"Oak Father,  guide my aid."
Halsin,Do not give up.
Halsin,Do  not give up yet.
Halsin,"Nature shall be defended, at any cost."
Halsin,"Yours are not the hands in which I would have placed such terrible power. Think carefully on your next action, please."
Halsin,Let our enemies' corpses nourish the ground.
Halsin,Let none see me.
Halsin,"Worry not, I shall help you."
Halsin,Hold tight.
Halsin,"I hear the gods enjoy taking on the form of swans, horses, eagles and the like when visiting with mortals."
Halsin,The power of nature flows through me.
Halsin,If you are sure aid is deserved...
Halsin,"Only a truly callous heart could refuse. Besides, our little abode could use a child's laughter."
Halsin,Almost wasted effort.
Halsin,"Well, it seems you have little fear of adventure of any sort, do you?"
Halsin,Indeed it does. Did you never experience such delights with Mystra? 
Halsin,Better see what is inside.
Halsin,"But that said, don't allow me to talk myself out of a night to remember all the time..."
Halsin,Need to open this.
Halsin,"An intriguing prospect, for sure... but I'm glad you've shown yourself to be comfortable in exploring without me. Sharing is important, but some things should be just for you."
Halsin,Nature blesses my gait with purpose.
Halsin,Allow me to help.
Halsin,Allow me to strengthen you.
Halsin,A little help is in order.
Halsin,This will serve you well.
Halsin,A discreet boost is in order.
Halsin,"A pick-me-up, if you will."
Halsin,You need healing.
Halsin,The battle is not won yet.
Halsin,Don't give up now.
Halsin,Stay strong.
Halsin,Fear not. Nothing is indestructible when nature's full fury is unleashed.
Halsin,"Oak Father, avert all eyes from me..."
Halsin,Let me strike true.
Halsin,Help is on the way.
Halsin,"Oak Father, harden my heart."
Halsin,None can withstand nature's wrath.
Halsin,"Silvanus, guide my blows."
Halsin,Let us see the battle won.
Halsin,The scent of blood is in the air.
Halsin,Do not relent.
Halsin,Enemies afoot.
Halsin,Nature's fury shall not be checked.
Halsin,I shall not yield.
Halsin,"Whatever may come, I stand ready."
Halsin,Enemies abound.
Halsin,"Oak Father, shield your servant."
Halsin,Leave it to me.
Halsin,"Well done - I knew your true nature remained, beneath those dark impulses. You are your true self, at last."
Halsin,No. It was everything.
Halsin,I shall never relent.
Halsin,Fear not.
Halsin,I shall not rest.
Halsin,I shall help.
Halsin,Aid is coming.
Halsin,There shall be no mercy.
Halsin,Here to help.
Halsin,"Have no fear, I am coming."
Halsin,None shall defeat me.
Halsin,I have nature's fury on my side.
Halsin,None shall withstand me.
Halsin,We shall prevail.
Halsin,"Do not worry, my heart."
Halsin,"Hold on, my love. For me."
Halsin,"Worry not, my heart."
Halsin,"Oak Father, guide my step."
Halsin,It shall be so.
Halsin,I shall go.
Halsin,There I shall be.
Halsin,Over I go.
Halsin,Better move.
Halsin,Here I go.
Halsin,If that is where I am needed.
Halsin,Better take this.
Halsin,Must not leave this behind.
Halsin,I shall take this.
Halsin,Ought to take this.
Halsin,May be of  use.
Halsin,This could be important. Or not.
Halsin,How clandestine.
Halsin,I shall go speak.
Halsin,I shall see to this.
Halsin,"A quiet word, then."
Halsin,A waste of resources.
Halsin,Do not cost us victory.
Halsin,Get up and fight.
Halsin,Try be less of a burden.
Halsin,Do not take this for granted.
Halsin,"No point in dawdling, I suppose."
Halsin,I better see to it.
Halsin,Over there? Of course.
Halsin,The very spot.
Halsin,Making my way.
Halsin,Over there? So be it.
Halsin,This will heal you.
Halsin,This will salve you.
Halsin,"I need you, my love."
Halsin,I will not go on without you.
Halsin,"Hold on, my love."
Halsin,"Hold on,  my heart."
Halsin,"I shall help you, my heart."
Halsin,I need you by my side.
Halsin,I need you in this fight.
Halsin,"I shall aid you, my love."
Halsin,I need you vitalised.
Halsin,Better get this open.
Halsin,Hmm.
Halsin,Need this unlocked.
Halsin,Consider it unlocked.
Halsin,I shall see it unlocked.
Halsin,Let me get this open. 
Halsin,This lock will yield soon enough.
Halsin,Better get this unlocked...
Halsin,"Have no fear, my love."
Halsin,"With haste, my love."
Halsin,I shall not leave you like this.
Halsin,Let me get this open...
Halsin,Locked? Not for long.
Halsin,Off I go.
Halsin,I shall move there.
Halsin,I shall force the lock.
Halsin,Let nature revitalise you.
Halsin,I shall handle it.
Halsin,I am to be your mouthpiece then? Very well.
Halsin,Keep low. Strike hard.
Halsin,A surprise attack? Very well.
Halsin,I shall strike like a hidden serpent.
Halsin,The first blow shall be mine.
Halsin,Hardly a chore.
Halsin,A clandestine pleasure.
Halsin,An unwelcome chore.
Halsin,"Very well, though they hardly deserve it."
Halsin,Others are more deserving.
Halsin,I shall see to that burden.
Halsin,I shall free you.
Halsin,"Hold on, I shall free you."
Halsin,"Trapped, are you?"
Halsin,I shall see you free.
Halsin,"This shall help, deserved or not."
Halsin,"A healing touch is in order, my friend."
Halsin,May nature heal all wounds.
Halsin,"This shall help you, friend."
Halsin,"Stay strong, my love."
Halsin,"Fear not, my heart."
Halsin,"Do not give up, my love."
Halsin,Do not falter! I am here.
Halsin,"Keep strong, my love."
Halsin,Do not yield. I am here for you.
Halsin,"Help is at hand, my love."
Halsin,I must attack without mercy.
Halsin,I shall deal with this.
Halsin,"Unseen, until it is too late."
Halsin,This one is mine.
Halsin,I shall do the talking.
Halsin,Right.
Halsin,I shall offer aid.
Halsin,I shall offer help.
Halsin,"A waste of air, but very well."
Halsin,Not a conversation I shall relish.
Halsin,"Unseen, like a stalking cat."
Halsin,Quiet as a mouse.
Halsin,Easy does it.
Halsin,"I am your servant, my heart."
Halsin,Deftly done.
Halsin,Unnoticed. Good.
Halsin,Incapable of speaking yourself? Fine.
Halsin,"I surprise myself, at times."
Halsin,Quite a feat.
Halsin,Success.
Halsin,I shall go have a word.
Halsin,I shall make my way.
Halsin,Low and slow shall see me there.
Halsin,"Need to get there, unseen."
Halsin,That's where I'll be.
Halsin,"Nice and quiet, now..."
Halsin,Softly now...
Halsin,I need to move.
Halsin,Must tread gently.
Halsin,Woe betide the victim of my blow...
Halsin,My fingerwork stands to me.
Halsin,"A discreet word, then."
Halsin,No hardship for me. Far from it.
Halsin,"Wait, please. There's more. The whole region around Moonrise is shrouded in a curse - a shadow curse.<br>"
Halsin,The very same. They saved something very precious to me from the grips of the shadow curse.
Halsin,The very same. She saved something very precious to me from the grips of the shadow curse.
Halsin,The very same. He saved something very precious to me from the grips of the shadow curse.
Halsin,"All the strength of the lands we healed flows through me. And from me, to you."
Halsin,"All the strength of the lands we healed flows through me. And from me, to you. And whatever company you keep. "
Halsin,"All the strength of the lands we healed flows through me. And from me, to you. No matter what form you take."
Halsin,"But you are right - you had no choice. I failed her, long before you arrived. "
Halsin,We allowed this unnatural thing to live - now a whole family's worth of blood is on our hands.
Halsin,The shadows could not have tempted her if I had taught her as I should have.
Halsin,But the grove still stands even if she does not - thanks to you.
Halsin,"Yes, you did. You acted according to your instincts, to nature. This is my fault. "
Halsin,"I was not here to guide them. Now they rest forever, while I carry the weight of my failings."
Halsin,But the grove still stands even if they do not - thanks to you.
Halsin,If only you had come to this place in more peaceful times. You'd have been a welcome addition.<br>
Halsin,Oakfather... a mind flayer spawn. You should be far gone by now.
Halsin,"...It's true. I can feel it right now. Oakfather preserve you, child."
Halsin,It sounds as if you've been done a world of harm. Cling onto the life you yet have.
Halsin,Now she stands poised to save the city. I can think of no champion more worthy. 
Halsin,Now he stands poised to save the city. I can think of no champion more worthy. 
Halsin,Now they stand poised to save the city. I can think of no champion more worthy. 
Halsin,Onwards. There is no reason to linger here.
Halsin,My heartfelt apologies. I meant no disrespect to your sacrifice.<br>
Halsin,"Of course, no slight intended towards your new form."
Halsin,Spilled blood will not right bad blood. Allow me to deal with my own - I still have need of her.
Halsin,"She knows now what cavorting in the shadows brings her. She will not stray again. Besides, this is no time to lose a promising druid."
Halsin,"You show no pity, no remorse. I cannot absolve you."
Halsin,You took it upon yourself to undertake the Rite of Thorns? I ought to exile you from this place. Forever.
Halsin,"Instead, I shall listen to the explanation that you owe me."
Halsin,"Your path will soon take you away from the grove, I feel. Your efforts will not be forgotten."
Halsin,"There's a chokehold of magic, binding the creature to you. Any efforts to remove it would almost certainly kill you - or worse."
Halsin,"With the leadership dead, no attack will be mounted on the grove. I am in your debt, my friend."
Halsin,"Take tonight to rest, recuperate - celebrate. Tomorrow, I'll join your camp so I can help with the trials yet to come."
Halsin,Soon. First I must set matters to rights in the grove. And you should celebrate your victory.
Halsin,There is little need for another power-hungry autocrat. I cannot applaud this.
Halsin,You are Ravengard's son... but does that mean you will be accepted as Grand Duke?
Halsin,"Perhaps you overestimate the openmindedness of the city, if you think they shall accept a devil as their Duke..."
Halsin,Let no prying eyes discover me.
Halsin,"After being dormant for so long, your infection is unlikely to produce new symptoms spontaneously."
Halsin,Kagha... poor child. The grove will be a dimmer place without her potential.
Halsin,I must be as a stone. Silent. Ignored.
Halsin,"I'm glad. Being comfortable in one's own skin is key to happiness, I find.<br>"
Halsin,"Enjoy the respite. Come morning, we have matters to discuss."
Halsin,A lofty goal. Be careful of Mystra - she shall not care to have a new rival.
Halsin,"We have what we need to proceed, and not a moment too soon - a winged aasimar flew overhead, and now an assault is brewing against Moonrise."
Halsin,I can work with that. Rest now.
Halsin,Patience. He's the key to this - I know it.
Halsin,"Astarion - the sun is burning you. To shelter, quick!"
Halsin,Don't do this - your life...
Halsin,"Our mind flayer acquaintance has wandered off. Not feeling quite herself, perhaps... Understandable."
Halsin,I fear her time is running short...
Halsin,What of Karlach? I cannot lay eyes on her...
Halsin,"You need aid, my love."
Halsin,Let me make things a little easier.
Halsin,"I will, but I need to know where Thaniel is. If I venture into the Shadowfell blind, I will never find him."
Halsin,"I don't deserve you, my friend."
Halsin,"Without Thaniel, no. And I don't know how I can find him without speaking to this man."
Halsin,"I'm afraid so, yes. Check his person - there might be something on him to help get us started."
Halsin,"We need to unlock whatever's left of him, inside his head. There must be something to trigger him - a word, a memory, an item. We just need to find it."
Halsin,"If he was able to escape the Shadowfell, then it mustn't have managed to consume his spirit - not all of it, anyway."
Halsin,See what you can learn from it. It might reveal something about his actions before the curse - then we may find means to wake him.
Halsin,"I still need your help. Meet me by the lakeshore, and be prepared. What comes next could prove... perilous."
Halsin,"Meet me by the lakeshore. I have what we need to proceed, but I'll need your help. Be ready, this may prove... perilous."
Halsin,"Last Light Inn... we rallied here once, years ago, before the assault on Moonrise Towers."
Halsin,"The Archdruid at the time spoke to us all, inspiring our courage... he was a fine leader."
Halsin,"Of course she will. The world has no need for a goddess who would hesitate at such a request from her champion. I hope to see you again, Gale."
Halsin,"But what awaits you, Gale? Your path ahead is... unclear."
Halsin,Perhaps it's time for a celebration. We have earned it. 
Halsin,What comes now? I cannot remember the last time we did not have a grand purpose to work towards...
Halsin,I shall miss him. Though I hope he proves to be a kindly god - I have had my fill of the tyrannical sort.
Halsin,"Though I hope he has the mettle needed to face Mystra. She will not yield willingly, I fear..."
Halsin,A new chapter awaits - let us make haste.
Halsin,"I am seldom one to imbibe, but even I shall make an exception on a day like today."
Halsin,An intriguing pair. Takes me back to my youth...
Halsin,"I think we have earned it, no?"
Halsin,I cannot imagine the strength it must take to deny yourself access to the world. Your benevolence truly knows no bounds.
Halsin,Let me get you open...
Halsin,Must be thorough.
Halsin,Better have a gander...
Halsin,What might this be hiding?
Halsin,Let me restore you.
Halsin,I need you in good health.
Halsin,Not a sight. Not a sound.
Halsin,Gale? You seem distracted - does something trouble you?
Halsin,"May he find the rest he deserves. Such an act will be remembered. And in its memory, he will live on. "
Halsin,"So modest of you. Indeed, the mighty oak need not boast of its branches.<br>"
Halsin,"I believe so. Once the din of battle has faded, we will truly know what has been saved today.<br>"
Halsin,It is up to you to prove the lessons have been learned once more.
Halsin,A dreadful misdeed - one she will never live down. But the grove still needs her passion.
Halsin,"As for the idol? It's nothing compared to a life. A mere object, next to one of nature's creations."
Halsin,"I cannot absolve you, even if you are repentant. "
Halsin,"The girl's parents should have decided your fate, but they perished. Instead, nature will judge you."
Halsin,"You are an enemy of nature, to be shunned until you redeem yourself or die. Now go."
Halsin,"Apologies for that ugliness. A more bitter homecoming than I would have wished, but at least the grove stands, thanks to you."
Halsin,Well done? No... this shouldn't have been necessary in the first place. I failed.
Halsin,Consider it in the past now. We must look forward.
Halsin,The grove stands. Nature prevails. I owe you my thanks - and an introduction.
Halsin,I am Halsin - First Druid of the Emerald Grove... and I sense you have a problem you seek my help with.
Halsin,"...It's true. I can feel it right now. Oak Father preserve you, child."
Halsin,How is this possible...?
Halsin,Perhaps... but I wouldn't want to place all my faith in blind luck.
Halsin,"It's no coincidence that we found each other, I'll wager? You're after a cure for this parasite."
Halsin,Someone is using very powerful magic to modify these tadpoles. They are using them to exert control over the infected. 
Halsin,"I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic. I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help."
Halsin,"You will stay, as a novice anew. You have forgotten the ways of the druids, the natural order of things."
Halsin,"Grace is bestowed by nature, not me."
Halsin,"It would have been easier if you just died, Kagha. Now I have to hear your excuses instead."
Halsin,"Be it with horns or tentacles, I am glad you have a future to look forward to, Karlach."
Halsin,"Something of use, perhaps?"
Halsin,A scaffold awaits Florrick. Perhaps we can free her.
Halsin,"Let me help you, love."
Halsin,This may prove useful.
Halsin,"You need healing, my heart."
Halsin,"More than interested, if you feel the same."
Halsin,"No, we cannot give up - not after all we have been through."
Halsin,Oak Father preserve us. That scheming brain is but a feast for the worms now...<br>
Halsin,"Are you sure of this course? It is not one that can be reversed, I fear."
Halsin,"Your gold, and your loins. Not for me to dictate what you do with either."
Halsin,Free for the taking.
Halsin,May serve some purpose.
Halsin,Better hold on to this.
Halsin,As you wish. I'm sure I can find berth elsewhere...
Halsin,"Oh, I suspect we shall be more than merry..."
Halsin,Perhaps you'd care for a little extra company...
Halsin,I shall claim this.
Halsin,"So long as all are willing, I see no reason why we should deny ourselves..."
Halsin,"You know my feelings - nature's impulses must be pursued. Do as you will, with my blessing."
Halsin,As does everyone. I have little doubt your efforts will be rewarded in whatever way you see fit.<br>
Halsin,To owe one's life to a mind flayer? It seems to make mockery of this entire struggle.
Halsin,"This is not a decision to make in haste. Let us talk it over, first."
Halsin,Now get out of my sight. There is nothing more to be said.
Halsin,I will allow you to stay. But consider yourself a novice anew. You have forgotten the ways of the druids - our place in the natural order.
Halsin,"You shall learn it all once again, right here. Backslide, and nature's fury will crush you."
Halsin,A misjudgement - one that should weigh heavily upon her. But the grove still needs her passion.
Halsin,She shows great insolence. But time will humble her - and the grove still needs her.
Halsin,"Misplaced, self-important concern. She must learn to respect the balance of all things. But the grove still needs her."
Halsin,You will soon see why. But enough of that for now - I owe you my thanks.
Halsin,No doubt you'd have me flay her or cast her into a spiked pit. But the grove needs druids.
Halsin,"There is naught a clear and meditative mind cannot overcome. After we stray, we return to the fold, having learnt to do better. And in the fold, Kagha is needed."
Halsin,"He paid the ultimate price, to save our lives. That should count for something, Lae'zel."
Halsin,"Fly on, Lae'zel. May the Oak Father preserve you and guide you true."
Halsin,"He did not hesitate. A true sacrifice, and a noble spirit. May his spirit find its way home."
Halsin,Your people are blessed to have him as their prince. I just hope he finds peace in his new form.
Halsin,His people are blessed to have him as their prince. I just hope he finds peace in his new form.
Halsin,"I cannot say I understand the reason for his death, but nature will reclaim him all the same. "
Halsin,This victory would not have been possible without you. I will never forget that.<br>
Halsin,"Of course, no slight intended towards your form."
Halsin,"Nature will determine your fate - whatever happens to you next, know that it is the Oak Father's will."
Halsin,What might be found?
Halsin,Please. Don't sully the gratitude I feel towards you by making excuses for Kagha. My choice was clear.
Halsin,"Her punishment is only just beginning, trust me."
Halsin,"At the goblin camp, I hoped to find a way to remove the tadpoles. I failed - but I did find the next best thing. I found out where they come from."
Halsin,I will do what I can to help you. Let us speak tomorrow - you and I both have matters to see to first.
Halsin,A mind flayer? What foul trickery is this?
Halsin,"As for what you've done for the grove, speak to Rath. He will see to your reward."
Halsin,I was an unwilling guest of the goblins - but your efforts left them in disarray and I was able to escape.
Halsin,Silvanus preserve us - that orb's about to shatter!
Halsin,"The grove stands. Nature prevails. And again, I am in your debt. "
Halsin,Speak to Rath - he will reward you for your efforts.
Halsin,No - have you taken leave of your senses?!
Halsin,Soon. Remember the dangers I told you about - there'll be plenty of time to face them.
Halsin,"Take tonight to rest, recuperate -celebrate. Tomorrow, I'll join your camp so I can help with the trials yet to come. "
Halsin,"Tomorrow morning, we shall discuss what is to come."
Halsin,If only you had come to this place in more peaceful times. You'd have been a welcome addition.
Halsin,And yet save it you did. I am grateful no matter what your motivations.
Halsin,"Believe me, it is. The span of a mortal life isn't enough to grasp the importance of this place. Its roots touch everything."
Halsin,"The journey to Moonrise Towers, and all the dangers that that entails."
Halsin,"But that's tomorrow's problem. Take some time for yourself tonight - rest, celebrate. Come morning, I'll be by your side."
Halsin,"Rest. Heal. Celebrate if you wish. Mourn if you must. Come morning, we shall discuss delivering you from your parasite."
Halsin,"Take tonight to rest, recuperate - celebrate. Tomorrow, we can strike out."
Halsin,"We prevailed, but only thanks to Gale. "
Halsin,The tadpoles must have died with the brain in the explosion. The threat of ceremorphosis is no more.
Halsin,He succeeded. The Netherbrain is defeated. 
Halsin,"I thought that nature would heal, and balance between it and civilisation could be restored, once and for all..."
Halsin,"For a while, after the shadow curse was lifted, I felt hope in a way that I hadn't felt in years."
Halsin,"I was concerned when I saw Shadowheart creeping about with a blade in the dead of night, but it was just to cut her hair, it seems. It suits her."
Halsin,That foul shapeshifter Orin is like a scavenger beast - probing us for weaknesses. Do not let her shake your resolve.
Halsin,You fought hard to win back control over yourself. I can only imagine how you feel - congratulations.
Halsin,"The moon weeps, for what Shadowheart has done. For her sake, I hope the approval of her goddess was worth it."
Halsin,"The moon weeps, Shadowheart, for what you have done. For your sake, I hope the approval of your goddess was worth it."
Halsin,"I'm glad you will not surrender an ally, but we should still be cautious around this one."
Halsin,You broke Dame Aylin's shackles once before. Do not help this one to forge new ones for her.
Halsin,Why tell him anything of Dame Aylin? Surely you do not intend to betray her...?
Halsin,Words won't repair what's been done to this land. Nothing will... I need to be alone.
Halsin,I must remain unseen.
Halsin,A sight to behold. If only we had Gale with us.
Halsin,One of us must take this step... and Karlach's time is already dwindling. Perhaps she is the champion we need.
Halsin,Still hidden.
Halsin,"A ruse, surely? You cannot actually intend to betray Shadowheart, after all you have been through... can you?"
Halsin,"One of us must take this step, Karlach. Your time with us is dwindling. Please, make it count."
Halsin,"Yet since we neared the city, I have seen more and more signs that I was being naive. Refugees, orphans, the downtrodden... all being left behind."
Halsin,"Perhaps the Shadow Druids were right, in their own twisted way. If such sorrows are the fruits of civilisation, perhaps there can be no true balance between it and nature."
Halsin,Look around us - you will not have to search for long to see exactly what I mean.
Halsin,"That poor girl, Yenna. This city will devour her as sure as any wild predator would do. Be it through malice or just neglect... her fate will be sealed by this place."
Halsin,"You... you shall? But what about all that you'll miss out on? Your name will be feted in this city - there will be parades, medals, feasts, hands to be shaken, babies to be kissed..."
Halsin,... are you truly sure? 
Halsin,Well... then let us make haste. You have quite a few little fans who will be overjoyed to make your acquaintance.
Halsin,"If you continue this course, I cannot remain by your side. I'm sorry I need to say this, but there will not be another warning."
Halsin,"I had hoped you would change your ways, after I last spoke to you - but no."
Halsin,"I trust you can restore my faith in you - we need each other, but there's a limit to what I can tolerate."
Halsin,"My friend, some of your choices have proven... troubling to me."
Halsin,Farewell. May the Oak Father keep you - for I will not.
Halsin,"So your confidante was a mind flayer all along...? Disquietening, to say the least..."
Halsin,"This is where we must part ways. I hoped it wouldn't be necessary, but no... I cannot turn a blind eye to your actions any longer."
Halsin,"Perhaps, but sometimes a raised tone is needed to shake others from apathy."
Halsin,"Temporary crises have a habit of becoming part of the everyday, given half a chance. A rot is taking hold here."
Halsin,I hope not. I truly do. But the signs say otherwise.
Halsin,At least we took Yenna in off the streets. But there are many more out there...
Halsin,"I... yes. Words chosen in haste, perhaps. I would rather see healing than punishment, in truth. And Oak Father willing, we shall live to witness it."
Halsin,"Perhaps... but small injustices cannot be ignored forever. We will save the world, but I wish it to be a place worth saving."
Halsin,"Societies should be judged based on how they treat their most vulnerable. Baldur's Gate may deserve harsh judgement, from what I've seen so far."
Halsin,Someone is planting bombs in children's toys - what madness is taking root in this place?
Halsin,"If such sorrows are the fruits of civilisation, perhaps there can be no true balance between it and nature."
Halsin,"And I... well, I shall have my own selfish reasons for wanting to see you again, if you wish the same."
Halsin,"The blight that was Orin has been purged from the world. And we have another Netherstone also - a significant step towards stopping this evil, once and for all."
Halsin,An unfortunate battle... but I must stand by those I count as allies.
Halsin,I sincerely hope that acquiring that amulet was the lesser of two evils...
Halsin,The Orphic Hammer is ours. Now to put it to use.
Halsin,The depths are no place for me - I shall be glad to walk upon dry land once again.
Halsin,The battle is not yet over - yet we still stand. Let us finish this.
Halsin,Very well...
Halsin,"We had an item of great magic before - what came of it, Gale?"
Halsin,An infernal abode. This is not a place in which we should linger too long.
Halsin,"For that at least, I am thankful."
Halsin,"Shar's worshippers had ambitions beyond their strength, it seems. The Astral Prism - or its inhabitants - would never have yielded to them. "
Halsin,The Netherbrain's lair. We may be near the end of all this...
Halsin,Freeing Mizora... I can only hope that is a kindness we do not come to regret.
Halsin,I can only hope he manages to find what he needs - for his sake and ours.
Halsin,"How can such a predicament come to be, I wonder...?"
Halsin,All of nature's creatures need to consume something to sustain themselves... but Gale needs to absorb powerful magic...?
Halsin,"This 'stone lord' and Minsc are one and the same? Jaheira's friend has taken a dark turn, it seems."
Halsin,"So be it. Whatever happens, I shall stand by you."
Halsin,I trust you to do what you think is best... but I just hope that we can indeed trust the Emperor in turn...
Halsin,I cannot believe Mystra would truly sacrifice a mind such as Gale's in order to stop the Absolute... he has so much potential...
Halsin,Hidden in the depths. The perfect place for nefarious secrets.
Halsin,Battle has been joined. We cannot let up until Ketheric Thorm is no more.
Halsin,"So, it seems that Vlaakith is your queen no longer, Lae'zel. That took no small amount of backbone."
Halsin,"My heart grows heavy for Karlach. She can touch, once more... yet is her remaining time to truly be so short? I shall pray to Silvanus that it does not come to pass."
Halsin,"Karlach. I am glad you can enjoy the touch of another once again... and I hope you are afforded much more time than you have been told. A lifetime and more, if I have a say in it."
Halsin,"Astarion, you have a remarkably healthy gleam in your eye, for one arguably closer to death than life."
Halsin,"Even with the shadow curse gone, Shar's presence blooms everywhere. No doubt her teachings have found a strong purchase amongst the city's populace."
Halsin,I am glad to have Gale back with us. The group would be poorer without his insights - and his company.<br>
Halsin,"Glad to have you back with us, Gale. The group would be poorer without your insights - and your company."
Halsin,"A shapeshifter infiltrating our number, like a cuckoo creeping into the nest? A dire threat, if Gortash indeed spoke the truth."
Halsin,Bhaal has condemned you to madness... I can only hope it does not come to pass.
Halsin,I cannot believe that Gale kept such a secret from us... and now his goddess wishes him to make the ultimate sacrifice in her name...?
Halsin,The decision is made. I can only pray to the Oak Father that we choose wisely. Onwards.
Halsin,Bears have perhaps the best sense of smell of all animals - a curse in a place such as this.
Halsin,"Painful truths have been thrust upon Shadowheart. I believe she is strong enough to endure, but her path will be easier with our support."
Halsin,"Shadowheart. These truths that have been revealed to you... I know they must be painful. But, Oak Father as my witness, I know you are strong enough to bear them. You need not walk this path alone."
Halsin,Wyrm's Crossing - the gaping maw of the city. Nature has little control over what happens beyond that bridge.
Halsin,There is no deal with a devil that I would willingly partake in. Declining Raphael showed great wisdom.
Halsin,"A foul place, that we have found ourselves in. But at least we survived the fall."
Halsin,"Let us not forget that we also have the Orphic Hammer. We could free Orpheus, let him wield the stones - if we can trust him."
Halsin,"So, it seems that Vlaakith is Lae'zel's queen no longer. That took no small amount of backbone."
Halsin,Raphael is no more. I shall not shed any tears.
Halsin,"You must visit as soon as you can - there will be much for you to see, and not a soul among our numbers who will not wish to praise the saviour of Baldur's Gate."
Halsin,"It is but a sprouting acorn for now, but given time and care, it could grow tall and mighty - and offer shelter to all who need it."
Halsin,"Better than Archdruid ever did. The old teachings could not have foreseen this world; I can see a new way to serve nature now - a path that all can follow, if they wish."
Halsin,My. And to think some shun organised religion...
Halsin,"A pleasant one, I hope."
Halsin,"Don't just stare, Gale. That mouth of yours can do better than just hang open, I'll wager."
Halsin,Hmm. Hovering yonder like a carrion bird. Perhaps he'll find the courage to peck at some flesh later.
Halsin,"Then I hope you are apt with shorthand, wizard. There will be much to observe."
Halsin,"I know that was not easy, but you made the right choice. A viper cannot escape its true nature, no matter how calm it may seem."
Halsin,"Regrettable. But if I am forced to weigh her life and freedom against your own, then I see little choice. "
Halsin,Then I must say farewell.
Halsin,"May the Oak Father preserve you throughout the challenges that await. You shall be in my prayers, always."
Halsin,"Thank you, for all you have done. Thaniel shall never forget you. Nor shall I."
Halsin,"If that is your wish, so be it. I sincerely hope I am proven wrong, but I cannot remain in order to find out."
Halsin,"I am loathe to put an ultimatum to you, but either Minthara or I must leave. I shall honour your choice, whatever it may be."
Halsin,"I am not without sympathy... but the risk is too great. We may share a foe, but we cannot be allies."
Halsin,The Absolute was just an excuse to indulge your base instincts. You shall find another.
Halsin,I am no stranger to the Underdark. Cruelty comes to Lolth's followers as naturally as breathing. I have seen it - experienced it.
Halsin,"She would have commanded her minions to slaughter everyone in the grove, given the chance. It was only because of Kagha's foolishness that she was denied her bloody prize."
Halsin,"I am sorry. You have proven an unmatched ally to me... but I cannot remain with you if that killer, Minthara, is to stay also."
Halsin,"Perhaps we should aid him - he is an old friend, after all. Or at least... an old acquaintance."
Halsin,Perhaps we should aid him - though we risk angering the crowd if we do.
Halsin,I must not be seen.
Halsin,"To watch a woman flush with pleasure is one of nature's sweetest gifts... though perhaps you will prove even sweeter, Shadowheart..."
Halsin,Good - its music might help restore him. Show it to him.
Halsin,We need to wake him. He must know something about where to find Thaniel.
Halsin,"An assault on Moonrise is brewing - time is not on our side, I fear. We find Thaniel soon. "
Halsin,We need to wake him and learn what he knows - change is afoot ever since that winged aasimar tore through the skies above us.
Halsin,"Very well... I wouldn't wish to risk damaging the room, I suppose."
Halsin,"But we must give the people what they want, mustn't we?"
Halsin,It's true then; he's met Thaniel - there's no other way he'd know that name. This is just what we needed - well done.
Halsin,"I saw a winged aasimar fly overhead, and now an assault on Moonrise is brewing - time is not on our side, I fear. We find Thaniel soon. "
Halsin,Let nature conceal me.
Halsin,The tadpoles must have died with the brain. The threat of ceremorphosis is no more.
Halsin,The final blow has been struck. The battle is surely won.
Halsin,He keeps saying Thaniel's name - he must know more. We need to rouse him.
Halsin,Then to Raphael's house we must go.
Halsin,"Lae'zel, no!"
Halsin,Look - the githyanki take flight.
Halsin,"Lae'zel, will you be joining them? "
Halsin,"To wish to live is natural, but so too is to let go, when the moment arrives."
Halsin,Careful now...
Halsin,Hard to believe we have actually prevailed. But it is true.
Halsin,We should honour the wizard's sacrifice. I shall plant a forest in his name. <br>
Halsin,"I can't pretend to understand your ambitions, or what drives them, but I wish you well. "
Halsin,"Easier said than done, I fear. You may find yourself welcome in some circles... but set upon in far more."
Halsin,"You would step forth, alone, to save the world at the expense of your own life. There would be no greater sacrifice."
Halsin,The Netherstones may yet work - this time.
Halsin,"The infamous figure from your dreams, I take it."
Halsin,"Fresh horrors. They will fall, like all the others."
Halsin,There is a particular discomfort to besting one you know to be weaker than yourself - even when needs must.
Halsin,"Do not yield, Karlach. This is not your time."
Halsin,"Do not yield, Karlach. Stay with us. Stay with the ones who love you."
Halsin,"She did good. Real good. It's not fair that she can't be here to reap the rewards, to live her life.<br>"
Halsin,"That orb can deliver us victory - but a sort that we would not live to enjoy. Let us at least see how we fare, and if all else fails... the option remains."
Halsin,Six months? It can be done. A long life well lived will soon render it but a fleeting memory.
Halsin,"When we joined battle for the last time, I did not want to presume we would survive. To feel your touch again seemed like a distant dream. That made last night all the sweeter."
Halsin,Do not be so modest - you gave as good as you got.
Halsin,Because I am. At least for now.
Halsin,"Part of me wishes we could stay in this room forever, you and I... but there is a new dawn breaking. And I have a part to play."
Halsin,"The wars of late have left many with nowhere to turn... Many lost their families, their homes - some never had them to begin with."
Halsin,"They need help - help that this city cannot provide right now. I shall aid them to make a new place for themselves, in Thaniel's realm, under nature's watch."
Halsin,"Now is the time for us to take care of each other. Already, people are gathering to depart. The promise of a new life inspires great haste."
Halsin,"At last count, there were nine whole wagons of children in tow. They are my duty now. 'Daddy Halsin', they call me. Who am I to tell them otherwise?"
Halsin,"She's gone... and Wyll's been dragged to the Hells in her wake. Silvanus, keep his memory."
Halsin,Hmm. The statue is unaware we triumphed by using less-than-honest means...
Halsin,"Gale - what's troubling you? We're nearly at the end, I know it"
Halsin,"Hmm. Nature used all of its powers when it sculpted you, Astarion."
Halsin,"You deserve so much better, but alas... I understand. Do as you must."
Halsin,"The Underdark? All part of nature's creation, of course, but perhaps not its most hospitable corner, after all we've been through..."
Halsin,Very well. Perhaps after a drink or five I'll be tempted to inflict some of my singing on you all - as if the city has not suffered enough.
Halsin,"He will sorely miss that freedom, I sense. It may be quite some time before we see him again. "
Halsin,"The sun is no longer your friend, then. A freedom you shall sorely miss, I feel."
Halsin,Many died so that we could see this day. They deserve to be honoured.
Halsin,"But first, we revel and rest.<br>"
Halsin,I could scarcely have imagined a mind flayer as an ally or a friend once... but I shall miss you.<br>
Halsin,I must keep out of sight.
Halsin,Perhaps. But I fear it would take an entirely fresh start to mend the ills of this place...
Halsin,"It was always destined to be so, if we prevailed. But the foreknowledge makes it no less bittersweet...<br>"
Halsin,Pity. A magical surrogate is no equal to nature's true creation.
Halsin,"As long as you like to be caressed by claws, Astarion."
Halsin,"Oak Father, let no gaze find me."
Halsin,"No! Cease now, before you doom us all!"
Halsin,Command it to die! It must be now!
Halsin,The end is upon us - ignore the brain's pleas. It must die!
Halsin,"Ha - tickles. See what a bad influence you are, Astarion?"
Halsin,"I assume you will not be surprised to learn I long to escape the city. I miss silence, greenery..."
Halsin,This shall sooth you.
Halsin,Slain by her own offspring? A perversion of nature.
Halsin,"A brew so potent, it makes you explode? Perhaps it has some use... though I struggle to see what."
Halsin,Consider my tongue wagging.
Halsin,There is no one I would rather talk to.
Halsin,You need not ask twice.
Halsin,Most consider it unwise to poke a bear.
Halsin,"My,  you are eager, are you not?"
Halsin,Please.  I am trying to be stealthy.
Halsin,"That must be where these enchantments are placed on them, and it's where you'll find your cure."
Halsin,I didn't find what I came here for - a way to remove the tadpoles - but I found the next best thing. I found out where they come from.
Halsin,"I'm sorry to say, I can't undo that magic, which means I can't cure you. But that doesn't mean I can't help."
Halsin,I've been studying these parasites for a while now. Ever since I discovered these so-called True Souls are infected with them.
Halsin,No. Everything went exactly as it was supposed to. But there's something else - something missing from Thaniel.
Halsin,Yes. I'll bring him back to camp. He'll be safest with us.
Halsin,"Come see us, when you can."
Halsin,"Come see us when you can. And be careful out there - forces may be rallying against Moonrise, but Ketheric Thorm is most dangerous when cornered. I know from experience."
Halsin,Perhaps he wishes to live vicariously through the attendees' appetites.
Halsin,"Withers has laid out quite a spread of food, for one comprising mostly of bone."
Halsin,I cannot remember the last time I heard the 'The Ballad of the Endless Spring' performed - now there's a ditty worthy of a knee-slap.
Halsin,"Conversation it is, then."
Halsin,"What is to be said, I wonder."
Halsin,Say no more.
Halsin,I better have a word.
Halsin,"Thank you. I know it's a great deal to ask, but the grove is everything to me."
Halsin,"You must get ahead of them, muster the defences. "
Halsin,It's too late to stop things from here - the goblins are already marching on the grove in force.
Halsin,"My thanks. If you prevail, I'll owe you the debt of a lifetime."
Halsin,I cannot allow these butchers to threaten my grove. The natural order must be protected.
Halsin,"I've no right to ask more of you... but if you could help me, I'd be free to join your journey to Moonrise. "
Halsin,"I wish I could, but there's still work I've yet to finish - blood I've yet to spill."
Halsin,Here - I need you strong.
Halsin,"Reunited with friends, amidst nature. What more could I wish for?"
Halsin,You could certainly use this.
Halsin,You made it! Now the revelry can truly begin.
Halsin,"Gladly, but first I must return to the grove. As you made short work of the goblins' leaders, there's nothing stopping me. Come join me in your own time."
Halsin,"Gladly, but I have some matters to settle first. You go ahead - I'll join you at your camp."
Halsin,"If you want to find a cure, you must head there and discover how the tadpoles are being manipulated."
Halsin,"Innocents go in, True Souls come out. Given that all of these True Souls are infected, it has to be the source of this magic."
Halsin,"I shall aid you, my friend."
Halsin,You could use a boost.
Halsin,I overheard that the cultists are sending all of their captives to Moonrise Towers.
Halsin,No! Stop!
Halsin,"Hurry, then. I will meet you there."
Halsin,Perhaps the bard knows some of my favourites - unless my taste in music is too antique of course.
Halsin,You weren't speaking lightly when you said you needed help. Let me tell you what I know.
Halsin,"You sound all but deranged by blood, but I suppose even a feral wolf has a caring hound at heart."
Halsin,"Killing's never my first choice, but those three were too dangerous to leave alive."
Halsin,"No, that's not right - praise you, my friend. The grove owes you a debt beyond measure."
Halsin,Very well. My claws are yours.
Halsin,"The ringleaders have to die. The very natural order of things is in danger, thanks to them."
Halsin,The grove is counting on us.
Halsin,Nature's blessings. Are you ready to do what is necessary?
Halsin,I'll wait here. Just know that you're gambling with the grove's very existence.
Halsin,Where are you going? We have work to do - enemies to kill.
Halsin,Calm yourself. There is plenty of me to go around.
Halsin,"Right away,"
Halsin,I need to examine him back at the camp.
Halsin,No - but some part of him is missing. He is... hollow.
Halsin,What was that? Are my senses betraying me...?
Halsin,"Something is amiss. I feel an odd presence on the air. Familiar, yet... different."
Halsin,"No, it can't be..."
Halsin,But something's wrong. Dreadfully wrong.
Halsin,"Let's get out of this pit, firstly. "
Halsin,"I have some matters to settle, then I'll join you at your camp. There, we can talk properly."
Halsin,Return to the grove; I'll make my own way there.
Halsin,"And you'll receive it. I'll make my way to your camp, as soon as I've settled some matters."
Halsin,Hmmm... that looks very alien. As alien as the mind flayers. They do not belong on this world.
Halsin,"Oak Father preserve you, child... You're infected, aren't you? The mind flayers' spawn."
Halsin,...Hrrm. That look in your eyes - I've seen it before. Are you feeling all right?
Halsin,I am aware. I foolishly left it vulnerable to this rabble. There's work to be done.
Halsin,"Come on then, what's the problem? Unless you'd rather wait for an audience of goblins."
Halsin,"Indeed? Not the most opportune moment, but given the lengths you went to, I assume there's some urgency."
Halsin,"Well, consider me introduced. And consider me grateful."
Halsin,"Yes, but just Halsin will suffice. Unbecoming to demand honorifics from the one who saved my hide."
Halsin,"I must be careful to not overindulge tonight, lest I lose control and slip into bear form..."
Halsin,"It is you who should be praised, sister - you are Silvanus' instrument. And please, just Halsin. I will not demand honorifics of my saviour."
Halsin,"I must admit, I didn't expect anyone would come to my aid. Who in their right mind would infiltrate a goblin infested temple. Unless..."
Halsin,"Either way, I owe thanks. I am the druid Halsin."
Halsin,You aided a bear without knowing if it would savage you? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic.
Halsin,"Not only do you speak with a bear, but you free it, too? A true friend of nature - or perhaps a lunatic."
Halsin,Pardon the viscera. One should cherish all of nature's bounty... but goblin guts are quite far down the list.
Halsin,I'll make my way to the grove - join me there. 
Halsin,"Not so hasty, friend. With the goblins' leaders dead, I can help you. I'll come to your camp, once I've settled some matters."
Halsin,And you'll receive it soon enough. Return to the grove; I'll make my own way there.
Halsin,"It is you who should be praised, brother - you are Silvanus' instrument. And please, just Halsin. I will not demand honorifics of my saviour."
Halsin,May Silvanus guide us.<br>
Halsin,"Then the grove is doomed, and perhaps you as well.<br>"
Halsin,I'll pray to Silvanus that you have a change of heart. But time is short.
Halsin,The grove is lost to me. To everyone. It's useless for me to stay here... there's nothing left to fight for.
Halsin,And you... the way you speak... you're worse than the Absolutists here. At least they live with the pretence of purpose.
Halsin,You will not see another day.
Halsin,Then... then it is as you say. They forgot their principles; you had no choice. I will mourn them when I can.
Halsin,Kagha... This is my fault - I was her teacher. I will mourn her when I can.
Halsin,But there are other matters to attend to before that.
Halsin,Kagha... I should have suspected she'd take things too far. I'll deal with her when I can.
Halsin,"That's true, I won't lie. But I won't let you march towards Moonrise without knowing what you'd face."
Halsin,"Nature speaks to me. Birds report what they've seen. And I've overheard goblins speaking of it, too. Moonrise is at the heart of all this, I'm sure of it."
Halsin,"As bones, perhaps. But their hidden structures might still remain."
Halsin,I don't know. Ketheric's followers were defeated or vanished before the effects of the curse took hold.
Halsin,"The decision is yours, but I'd favour the Underdark. Even a place like that is the lesser evil compared to the shadow-cursed lands."
Halsin,Anything is preferable to risking the shadow curse.
Halsin,I'll remain here and do what I can to disrupt these cultists' plans. Perhaps I can stop their attack before it's even launched. Farewell.
Halsin,Farewell. I don't expect we'll meet again - at least not in this life.
Halsin,"It seems the Absolute's forces are already marching on the grove. I'll have to try get ahead of them, do what I can."
Halsin,"I'll need that luck, along with all the Oak Father's blessings.<br>"
Halsin,"I will find you at your camp, and help you with your problem. Right now, I... I need to go be alone. "
Halsin,"If you should have a chance to strike down the leaders of this horde, the world will be a better place for it. Farewell."
Halsin,"I'm as certain as I can be. If you have a better alternative, I won't stop you. "
Halsin,"I will help however I can. Let me see to some matters, then I will join you at your camp."
Halsin,There is nothing more to be said... I need to be alone.
Halsin,We were this close to healing these lands. Now your arrogance has torn open the wounds once more.
Halsin,My friend - I wish you had trusted in me.
Halsin,I should never have trusted an ally of the Dark Lady.
Halsin,Get rid of them. Release me.
Halsin,Nature's blessings. I thought you'd be on your way by now... unless you changed your mind?
Halsin,Perhaps there's something else I can offer you.
Halsin,"Oh, certainly. But I live modestly at the best of times, and this is far from the best of times."
Halsin,I could come and help you... but be warned - I won't be able to suppress my animal side. Subtlety will not be an option.
Halsin,A jest - I truly am grateful. If only I could repay you.<br>
Halsin,"It's no coincidence that you found me here, I'll wager? You're after a cure for this parasite."
Halsin,I had no idea anyone beyond their ranks was infected. You have my sincere sympathies.
Halsin,"A drow forced me to defend myself. Afterwards, I was able to study the parasite that slithered out of the corpse, see what drives these 'True Souls'."
Halsin,"Indeed. After we dealt with the drow that ambushed us, Nettie and I were able to inspect the corpse - and the creature that slithered out of it."
Halsin,Patience. I can't just snap my fingers... but I know where the solution almost certainly lies.
Halsin,Wait - I could help you find a cure... but I need to settle matters here first.
Halsin,"Wait. Now that the goblins' leaders are dead, I could join you - help you find a cure. I just need to make arrangements back at the grove. Find me there, if you wish."
Halsin,"Not that I'm eager to try stopping you, given the short work you made of the leadership here. With them dead, it's high time I got back to the grove."
Halsin,"Ah. Lunatic, then."
Halsin,"You know what's needed - the deaths of Dror Ragzlin, the drow Minthara, and the priestess, Gut. May nature guide you."
Halsin,"Now, there's no time to lose - get to the grove and help with the defences. "
Halsin,You will? Oak Father bless you. I'll be in your debt twice over if we succeed.
Halsin,Perhaps you can enlighten me.
Halsin,"Unfair of me, perhaps, but I've had few encounters with drow to make me think otherwise."
Halsin,"You drow relish turning on your own, if there's something to be gained. Don't pretend otherwise."
Halsin,May Silvanus guide your hand. Focus on the leaders - that's all it will take to restore the balance here.
Halsin,So be it. May Silvanus lend us nature's fury.
Halsin,"If I join you, we'll likely have to slaughter this entire place. You may want to use discretion when approaching the goblin leaders."
Halsin,Be warned - my presence could make things more difficult... I can only restrain my bear form so much. I won't be able to help but attack goblins.
Halsin,There is no safety. Not while this rot festers. Once it is cut out - once the grove is secure - then I shall leave. 
Halsin,"I understand. You've done far more than most have for the grove, just by freeing me."
Halsin,"I told you, nowhere is safe. Not while this rot festers. Once it is cut out - once the grove is secure - then I shall leave. "
Halsin,You did...? Nature's found a most furious defender in you.
Halsin,They are the ones holding these parasites together. Remove them and nature will cure itself. 
Halsin,"Three deaths could win us peace: the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut."
Halsin,"Help me kill the leaders of this horde, save my grove. Then I will help you. <br>"
Halsin,"It's too late to merely kill this horde's leadership - their forces are already marching. If you want me to help, you need to help me first."
Halsin,"Rare is the beast that survives decapitation. Help me eliminate the drow Minthara, the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin, and that perversion of a priestess, Gut."
Halsin,"Death is nature's final slumber - it awaits us all. Do not punish yourself over those lost, or give in to despair - not while there are still folk in need of your help."
Halsin,"As you wish. Better I impart the knowledge to you now, in case I fall trying to defend the grove."
Halsin,Very well. Return to the grove. I'll make my own way there - then we can see about this parasite of yours.
Halsin,No. Free me.
Halsin,"I cannot come with you, though I wish I could. At least let me tell you what I know; help you on your journey."
Halsin,This is different. There's more fingers on a hand than there are survivors of that place.
Halsin,"But the grove must come first, I'm afraid."
Halsin,"If I could join you and get close to Moonrise, perhaps I could have both helped you find a cure for your infection and lifted the curse."
Halsin,"I spent years researching the curse, trying to put an end to it. Nothing has worked - yet."
Halsin,"My business there began long ago, and has led to a lifetime of regret."
Halsin,You may reconsider once you see the effects of the curse for yourself.
Halsin,"One of the adventurers had a clue to help find it - a dwarf called Brian. It might still be found on his corpse, wherever the goblins left it."
Halsin,"You'll need to pick up where Aradin left off - find the hidden entrance. It's somewhere in these ruins, from what I've heard."
Halsin,Already...? If only I'd gone with you instead of Aradin.
Halsin,Travelling to Moonrise is no small task. Expect dangers like you've never seen before.
Halsin,You've already been? Impressive. You'll make me redundant at this rate. What did you find?
Halsin,"From this stronghold, Ketheric's forces could access both the temple of Selûne and Moonrise Towers - but he was defeated before he could launch an attack."
Halsin,Aradin and his lot were looking for a way down there - they were promised riches if they retrieved a relic called the Nightsong. But I think there's more.
Halsin,"Long ago, a man called Ketheric Thorm built a secret stronghold deep down there, before rallying a whole army of Dark Justiciars - Shar worshippers."
Halsin,"You could go overland - along the Risen Road or through the mountains. Easier at first, but you'll run into the shadow curse eventually."
Halsin,By all means - pursue any leads you may have. But I sense all roads will lead to Moonrise.
Halsin,"So it seems, though I don't know how. You will have to choose your approach carefully."
Halsin,"You're half right - you have to get to Moonrise, but you still have a choice of how to get there."
Halsin,"This curse shrouds everything in shadow - you will not find life, light, or anything natural there."
Halsin,"If you can find this place, I'll wager it will reveal a more direct path to Moonrise Towers, and may bypass the worst of the shadow curse."
Halsin,Fair. But a decision is still needed.
Halsin,*Whimper.*
Halsin,You chose. You die with them.
Halsin,A useful advantage.
Halsin,We would struggle to find a less trustworthy creature.
Halsin,"In a bind, are you?"
Halsin,A little extra damage-dealing. Good.
Halsin,This will prove a boon in a fight.
Halsin,I would not want to be on the receiving end...
Halsin,I shall do as I am bid.
Halsin,I can think of others I would rather tend to...
Halsin,"Ill-deserved, but very well."
Halsin,This will help  - though it is scarcely deserved.
Halsin,"Karlach? Speak to me, please."
Halsin,"Minsc? Jaheira's acquaintance, I believe."
Halsin,The Blade of Frontiers'. It seems you have come full circle.
Halsin,They have taken both Jaheira's friend and her face. Their gall knows no bounds.
Halsin,"A cruel bind. Mizora is like a spider, and you the enwebbed fly."
Halsin,"Fine, I'll help."
Halsin,"Your health is my chore, it seems."
Halsin,This will do some damage.
Halsin,I must use every advantage.
Halsin,"Hurry, please. Any delay could cost innocents' lives."
Halsin,The ringleaders of these butchers still draw breath. Nobody is safe until we stop them.
Halsin,She is a child in need of help - let your harsh words go unspoken.
Halsin,Poor child. I can only hope her mother does return - she should not be left alone here.
Halsin,One from which he will awaken soon.
Halsin,This city is a poor place to be in need of help. Even the guards can't be trusted to protect the most vulnerable.
Halsin,I wonder if he can hear us.
Halsin,He blinked. A code perhaps?
Halsin,"He is lucky to have you watching over him, thank you."
Halsin,Do not give up hope just yet.
Halsin,"This may keep the city safe, but to seal all those unfortunates away forever...? Death would have been more merciful."
Halsin,Has he shown any sign of coming to his senses?
Halsin,"He's looking at me, I'm sure of it."
Halsin,No lock shall thwart me.
Halsin,Time is not something we have in abundance. Lives are at stake.
Halsin,Is it working? I thought he would be awake.
Halsin,This lock shall yield to me.
Halsin,Time this was unlocked.
Halsin,The true Ravengard remains in there somewhere. Perhaps he can yet be restored.
Halsin,Punished? Then Florrick has been captured... or perhaps is no more.
Halsin,"Art? Hail, Art - can you hear me?"
Halsin,"His pallor is improving, at least."
Halsin,Let nature cloak me from all eyes.
Halsin,An ally in need - though scarcely a friend.
Halsin,You didn't need to be so hard on him.
Halsin,"It's done. More cruelly than it needed to be, but done all the same. We should return to Thaniel when we can."
Halsin,Well done.
Halsin,"It's done, at last. Soon the land will be unshrouded. We should return to Thaniel when we can."
Halsin,It shall be done.
Halsin,No - you were stolen from each other. Neither of you are to blame. And I know your pain. I truly do.
Halsin,"Thaniel was my friend also. I played with him, grew up while he stayed the same. He made me who I am today, and then he was ripped away from me, same as for you."
Halsin,But you need not be alone any longer. You need not invent friends. Thaniel is back. He is waiting for you.
Halsin,You deserve to be banished.
Halsin,You imperilled the grove - how dare you even look me in the eye.
Halsin,"A hard-earned chance at life. You deserve it, Karlach."
Halsin,This city fails those who need its aid the most. No child should be abandoned like this.
Halsin,Poor woman. No doubt she came to this city hoping for a better life.
Halsin,I shall retrieve that.
Halsin,Something worth taking?
Halsin,I thought I had been a good teacher to you. Clearly not.
Halsin,You will not desecrate this grove! Not while I draw breath!
Halsin,"Be gentle. He's much more than a child, but he doesn't truly know that."
Halsin,Let's make this quick. We need to reunite him with Thaniel.
Halsin,"He's fled - we need to track him down. Wherever the curse is strongest, that's where he'll go. That's where he'll feel safe."
Halsin,"That's him - like an echo of Thaniel, remoulded by the curse. We need him, if we're to put a stop to all of this."
Halsin,Come on.
Halsin,You should take better care of yourself.
Halsin,Allow me to fetch that.
Halsin,They are our guests until they wish to leave - as I said as the day they arrived.
Halsin,And what have you brought? Harmony? Balance?
Halsin,You imperilled the grove. I'm surprised you dare show your face.
Halsin,"Beg Silvanus, not me."
Halsin,Perhaps you will prove yourself worthy of forgiveness. Perhaps not.
Halsin,My skills are wasted on this one.
Halsin,At least you recognise your mistake. This is a beginning - a small one.
Halsin,"I cannot venture back with you - now that I am in a position to fight the curse, I must stay here and see it through."
Halsin,Thank you. I would hate to have to flee from the shadow curse once again.
Halsin,"If you truly need to retread your steps, then you will have little need for me there. You are more formidable than anything that lies in our wake."
Halsin,I must continue to investigate the curse - this may be my last chance. I shall await your return when you are ready to continue.
Halsin,Very well. I shall seek out your camp as soon as you find yourself amidst the curse again.
Halsin,You will make peace with all who seek shelter here. It is the will of Silvanus.
Halsin,Oh child. You have drifted far from the Oak Father's teachings.
Halsin,Do not forget who invited those shadows. You have much to learn still.
Halsin,This town - I remember it too well. Much druid and Harper blood was spilled in taking it... only to lose it again.
Halsin,Now if only words would flow out of him.
Halsin,"Imagine fleeing to the city, only to be met with suspicion. The refugees face hardship at every turn."
Halsin,It's ready - I'm going through. May the Oak Father guide me back to you.
Halsin,"Later, perhaps. Don't worry about me. A night under the stars amidst nature's creation is just what I need after being locked up in the goblins' dungeon."
Halsin,"Ah, I see. Perhaps I can help you with that, another time."
Halsin,"Let's begin. Whatever happens, do not attempt enter the portal, and do not let anything interfere with it."
Halsin,"To your good health, my friend."
Halsin,"We'll have time to spare for that, I sense. I'm surprised you haven't had your fill of me already."
Halsin,But there are many grateful people here who want to spend time with you. I must not keep you all to myself. As enjoyable as that may be.
Halsin,Healing is on the way.
Halsin,You need a restorative.
Halsin,I'm sure there are. You strike me as extremely... resourceful.
Halsin,"In truth, I rarely imbibe. The stuff goes right to my head. Before you know it, I'd be breaking into song or declaring love to the first person I laid eyes on."
Halsin,"Go on now, don't waste a night like this talking to me. We'll discuss your problem tomorrow."
Halsin,Let me be of aid.
Halsin,"Go on now, don't waste a night like this talking to me. We'll have plenty of time together on the way to Moonrise."
Halsin,"Enjoy yourself tonight. Come morning, we've got a hard road ahead of us."
Halsin,"All these people, fleeing for their lives... only to be corralled like cattle."
Halsin,Even carrion birds would not stoop so low.
Halsin,Enjoy yourself tonight. I'll come find you in the morning so we can talk.
Halsin,Good. Now they die.
Halsin,"Go on, enjoy yourself. Seek out some wine before it runs dry - there are a lot of thirsty people around here."
Halsin,This shall empower you.
Halsin,Nature stands by your side.
Halsin,Release me.
Halsin,*Growl.*
Halsin,Stop them. Free me.
Halsin,*Huff.*
Halsin,You chose. Die with them.
Halsin,*Roar!*
Halsin,Time for blood.
Halsin,I shall open it.
Halsin,A carrion bird would have more dignity. This city feeds on those that need it most.
Halsin,Better see this open.
Halsin,"It's done, I have him."
Halsin,"You did - and most splendidly. But if we are to restore the land, there is more to be done."
Halsin,Use this wisely.
Halsin,It's ready. I'll return with Thaniel as soon as possible. Stay close to the portal - buy me what time you can.
Halsin,"Oak Father, hear me, aid me. Force open the jaws of Darkness. Make passage for your vessel of Light."
Halsin,"It took me years of study, of seeking the Oak Father's favour, to find a way to part the veil. Pray that this works."
Halsin,Let the Oak Father's strength flow through you.
Halsin,Allow me to strengthen your hand.
Halsin,I need to get this open.
Halsin,Imagine upending someone's life in the name of bureaucracy. People are out of touch here.
Halsin,I thought cities were supposed to welcome folk of all walks of life. Clearly I was mistaken.
Halsin,Let's begin. Remember what I told you - we won't have a second chance here.
Halsin,Now an assault is brewing against Moonrise - our time may be running short. We need to awaken the fist before it's too late.
Halsin,"That Flaming Fist sleeps deeply - even when that winged aasimar tore through the skies overhead, he did not stir."
Halsin,"Meet me at the lakeshore, and be prepared. What comes next will be perilous."
Halsin,"Oak Father willing, we will soon lift the curse from this place. But I suspect a shadow will linger here, because of what was done to that man."
Halsin,You can claim it so... but I don't think it will ever be true.
Halsin,True. But are we still deserving? Only time and nature can tell.
Halsin,"That is what I needed to know. It should be cause for joy, but... that poor man didn't have to die."
Halsin,Good - its music might help restore him. Bring it to him.
Halsin,"That fist could sleep through the end of the world - and he may do so yet, unless we can rouse him."
Halsin,What news?
Halsin,Consider it open.
Halsin,Part the veil separating darkness from light.
Halsin,It shall be unlocked.
Halsin,Nearly there! Just another moment!<br>
Halsin,It's working - just give me some more time!<br>
Halsin,I shall see it open.
Halsin,Make a doorway from nothingness. Grant me passage.<br>
Halsin,Carve a way through the shadows. Cast light on what is sought.
Halsin,Any word? I can't help but fear the chance to save Thaniel is slipping away from us...
Halsin,No. Why?
Halsin,That Flaming Fist survived the Shadowfell - I need to talk to him. There must be a way to rouse him from his stupor.
Halsin,"An omen of change if I ever saw one - we should double our efforts to save Thaniel, before fate wrests the chance from us. What news?"
Halsin,"The shadows won't be banished without a fight. Once I open the portal, they'll swarm like carrion birds and try to destroy it. You must not let that happen."
Halsin,"I'd rather have you by my side, but this is the only way. "
Halsin,"No. If there's any interference with the portal, then our one chance is lost forever. And so am I. "
Halsin,"Good. Now it's important that only I pass through the portal once it opens. The magic is fragile - any mistake, and our one chance will be lost forever."
Halsin,I need you to stay here. Keep the portal open until I return - and defend it at all costs. 
Halsin,This will set you right.
Halsin,"With the Oak Father's blessing, I can infiltrate the Shadowfell, but doing so will sap my strength. I'll need your help if I'm to return."
Halsin,What I would not give for a chunk of fresh honeycomb...
Halsin,"A winged aasimar tore through the skies like a bolt of lightning, crying for vengeance. "
Halsin,Such attention... I never realised I was so popular.
Halsin,But I didn't bring you here to witness an old druid's grandstanding. You have a part to play in this - and I trust you will play it well.
Halsin,"Are you feeling lonely, perhaps?"
Halsin,"No. This opportunity has been a hundred years in the making. It has to be me, and only me."
Halsin,"Unwise, perhaps, to poke a bear this much..."
Halsin,"Thaniel is trapped in the Shadowfell, but thanks to your efforts, I know where to look. Now I must go there - alone."
Halsin,"You're here, good. Now we can begin."
Halsin,"We should begin at once, before we lose the opportunity."
Halsin,"You're here, good. And not a moment too soon - a winged aasimar was seen in the skies overhead, and now an assault on Moonrise is brewing."
Halsin,Wrong. You are the beacon that will guide me home.
Halsin,"Now, the final decision rests with you. Whatever you choose, I shall be by your side."
Halsin,Soft as a summer breeze...
Halsin,"So be it, then. We must do all we can to help her reach her destiny."
Halsin,Just as nature intended. Come here to me -
Halsin,"Forgive me. I... lost the run of myself. Sometimes, if blood runs hot enough, it's difficult to tame the beast."
Halsin,You... like it?
Halsin,I need no further encouragement...
Halsin,More?
Halsin,"Ah... I see. Well, of course. Back to camp then."
Halsin,Do not misunderstand me. I want this.
Halsin,"As do you, I think."
Halsin,Come. Feel for yourself.
Halsin,Nor am I.
Halsin,"Her free will gone, as soon as the elder brain willed it. What else is it capable of...?"
Halsin,I shall have you free in a moment.
Halsin,"I shall right this, my friend."
Halsin,I cannot help but wonder how she would have handled some of the challenges I faced as Archdruid. Perhaps the Rite of Thorns could have been avoided. It is hard to say.
Halsin,I cannot help but wonder how she would have handled some of the challenges I faced as Archdruid. Defended the grove? Kagha? The Shadow Druids?
Halsin,"There is much to admire, judging by the stories."
Halsin,"No matter how long I live, I will always strive to remain a keen pupil. Only a fool would think he could drink in all knowledge until none is left. There is always more - nature's tapestry is infinitely complex."
Halsin,"Though in truth, I should not be surprised - she was always said to be formidable - and cunning. I could have learned much from her, no doubt."
Halsin,"Oh. If that's what you prefer, so be it."
Halsin,"Almost frightened. If you feel my heart quicken, it's not from fear."
Halsin,"As I do you. But nevertheless, I will be gentle."
Halsin,Or at least I will try.
Halsin,"You cannot bear to be apart from me, I see?"
Halsin,"The childrens' sense of humour is rubbing off on me, perhaps..."
Halsin,'Fancy a b-oink?' Indeed; you'll be hard-pressed to find a joke I haven't... oh.
Halsin,"Tusk - a boar, back in the grove. I had promised to help find him a mate before we embarked on our quest, but with all that transpired... I forgot."
Halsin,Come morning I shall write a letter of enquiry as to his condition. A promise is a promise - Tusk shall have his mate.
Halsin,"Enjoying yourself, I trust? I certainly am."
Halsin,"I sense tonight is a night I will look back on fondly, in years to come."
Halsin,Quite an atmosphere. I would not have presumed Withers to have a festive touch.
Halsin,You needed something?
Halsin,A tricky one. I shall help.
Halsin,What use are city walls if the people within them must still live in fear...?
Halsin,"Unnatural wickedness. Take no part in this, please."
Halsin,"Worry not, my friend."
Halsin,You came. I was concerned you might have had doubts. Or that this might have all been too soon...
Halsin,Yes you are. And you're perfect.
Halsin,As have I. It's been worth the wait.
Halsin,Perhaps a little. Do you know how hard it's been for me to contain myself?
Halsin,"I'm almost frightened to touch you - if I give in, I may not be able to stop until I have devoured you."
Halsin,"Nevertheless, I will be gentle."
Halsin,"And in the chaos that ensued, well... our forces were scattered. I led some to safety, but never learned of her fate. I'm glad to hear she survived. "
Halsin,You are right. Perhaps I am simply out of practice.
Halsin,"Only by reputation. She was present when we marched against Ketheric Thorm, but on the far end of the battle lines from where I fought. "
Halsin,The missing part of him must be near there. We need to search that area.
Halsin,"I waited for my chance, and did what was necessary to survive. And perhaps a few things that were less than necessary."
Halsin,It was not ideal... but not without its positives either. I did what was necessary to survive. And perhaps a few things that were less than necessary.
Halsin,"The house matron took an interest in me, and the patron also... They saw me as a novelty, perhaps. I was chained in their bedchamber for nigh on three years."
Halsin,"It was a long time ago. I was a foolhardy young druid, intent on seeing the beauty of nature's unworldly fauna and subterranean glow for myself..."
Halsin,I am sure they are well used to it. Cramped streets and thin walls make for people adept at ignoring things. You could find yourself more alone in a city than in the deepest woods.
Halsin,Very much so. One positive I will concede about city life is that you never know what lies around the corner.
Halsin,Indeed. Our time with them was... certainly bracing. Takes me back to some youthful misadventures in the Underdark.
Halsin,There must be no more Yennas.
Halsin,"Don't misunderstand me - I feared for my life, and wanted my freedom back, but I was willing to wait for my moment, and eventually it came."
Halsin,"No matter how long I live, I will never get used to the cruelties that infest our world. That such evil is allowed to breathe the same air as us is an abomination."
Halsin,"Killing Orin won't bring Yenna back, but it may give her some peace, and me... a great deal of satisfaction."
Halsin,But still... we all failed that little girl.
Halsin,"You thought she was an imposter - a threat. This was a trap of Orin's creation. Yenna's death is on her hands, not yours."
Halsin,"Perhaps one day you and I can both return, and see it for ourselves."
Halsin,"He is well - and Oliver also. At times they are one, and at others they divide. Easier for playing, perhaps. And the land thrives also. I doubt you would recognise it."
Halsin,I have. He speaks to me during my nightly meditations.
Halsin,"Some can thrive here, yes. But it was never meant for everyone. There should be a choice. Nature should be afforded its chance to offer harmony to those who need it."
Halsin,But that must wait for now - there are battles yet to be fought. We must save the world before we can dream of ways to better it.
Halsin,I thought we would be able to help her. I thought we would be able to keep her safe.
Halsin,"Lolth's noble houses are constantly at each other's throats, and eventually, some rivals of my hosts sought to unseat them."
Halsin,"It was chaos - drow against drow, the clash of blades echoing throughout caverns, the feel of warm blood that I could not see..."
Halsin,"...I took my chance and fled while all were distracted. I never looked back until I breathed fresh air again, and never learned what came of my hosts."
Halsin,Flowers in bloom where nothing else grows...? That is a sign of Thaniel's power - it must be.
Halsin,Our time with those two drow was... certainly bracing. Takes me back to some youthful misadventures in the Underdark.
Halsin,"Indeed. Thank you for inviting me. I hadn't realised you considered me a worthy accomplice in such matters. I hope you'll keep me in mind, in future."
Halsin,"A very likely outcome - in fact I saw decorations of that very type, and worse, in my time there. But my luck held."
Halsin,"The passage of time has a strange way of polishing even the most arduous of memories into precious keepsakes. Had circumstances been slightly different, I may have been put to work in mines, or killed outright."
Halsin,It was touch-and-go for a while...
Halsin,Indeed... perhaps I carry more resentment than I realise.
Halsin,Perhaps that is so. It has been so long that I may have forgotten the peril that I faced.
Halsin,"... interesting. Part of me still thought of them as hosts, but I suppose captors is indeed more accurate."
Halsin,"You would be unwise to attempt it, trust me. In any case, the house of my captors is long-extinct."
Halsin,"It would be easy to resort to nature's fury whenever something stood in my way, yet I cannot help but feel I would be sullying the Oak Father's gifts. Naive perhaps... but I still draw breath."
Halsin,"I am aware. Perhaps I put too much faith in my skills of negotiation, or want to see good where there is none."
Halsin,"I... have not had true confidantes for some time. The Shadow Curse robbed me of almost all my peers, and replaced them with the weight of responsibility. Perhaps that caused me to gild undeserving memories of my youth."
Halsin,"No - I shall not take you for granted, nor my own past. What is the point of long life, if one does not make room for reflection?"
Halsin,"Lolth's noble houses are constantly at each other's throats, and eventually, the house that held me fell out of favour, and was attacked."
Halsin,I am lucky to have your counsel. It was sorely needed.
Halsin,"I lost friends, confidantes, and had the weight of responsibility bear down on me unrelentingly. There was scant opportunity for self-reflection..."
Halsin,"Apologies, I meant no offence. I survived, and in years to come, I must have allowed hardships to become dwarfed by the Shadow Curse in my mind."
Halsin,Time can prove to be a trickster on one's recollections - what would be multiple lifetimes for others now separate me from my captivity... perhaps I have lost perspective on what happened to me.
Halsin,"In fact, I think I saw just the sort before, not long after we first came within reach of the shadow curse. Fool that I am, I did not grasp their significance at the time."
Halsin,"Of course. I have just become unaccustomed to free time, perhaps. I feel like I am neglecting something."
Halsin,"Oh, to have your confidence. You must think me like a mother hen..."
Halsin,Then I shall take courage from your example.
Halsin,"A touch bleak perhaps, but considering the amount of orphans in my audience, I am sure they shall manage."
Halsin,I can make something palatable with a little showmanship and creative licence - thank you.
Halsin,"Yet not by me. I shall tell the children of your heroism and sacrifice. They shall know what they owe to you, trust me."
Halsin,"Too murky for a children's tale, I fear. Perhaps I should focus on the hero you were, and the sacrifice you made. But thank you for sharing, nonetheless."
Halsin,I see. Perhaps the children can learn something from your ambition in the face of adversity. Thank you.
Halsin,"And with an appetite for the grey ambrosia that dwells within every skull, I presume? Perhaps I shall remind the children of your heroism and self-sacrifice... and skip over the brain-eating until they are older."
Halsin,I am glad you have kept yourself occupied. No doubt I will be able to spin a few yarns from the children from this. Thank you.
Halsin,"I see... then I hope she understands. You have steered us true, thus far."
Halsin,Most enthralling - though perhaps it may lead to some sleepless nights for the younger ones.
Halsin,"Of course. Disagreements, friction, opposing cultures, and our fair share of petty nonsense that I shall not bore you with. It is to be expected, wherever people gather to make a life for themselves."
Halsin,"Ah, my greatest purpose, and greatest reward. Those children have been through more than fate had any right to cast at them, and yet they go on, as resilient as anything in nature."
Halsin,"I impart what knowledge I can to them, yet in truth they teach me far more. The land we saved is theirs, and they will cherish it, I am sure. Thaniel and Oliver shall never want for friends ever again."
Halsin,"I shall not push the matter if you are not comfortable. I can tell you how I have been faring, if you wish?"
Halsin,"Ah, as you wish. Enjoy yourself."
Halsin,"That was more than worth the wait... oh, I suppose you didn't mean that literally."
Halsin,"Still, perhaps I can yet serve nature in another way, once our journey has ended. I can only pray that the Oak Father grants me new purpose."
Halsin,"And I have been evicted from the very place I was charged to safeguard. A telling summary of my time as Archdruid, perhaps..."
Halsin,"None - the grove has cut itself off from the world, to jealously guard its own little pocket of nature. No one shall ever enter or leave again."
Halsin,"And in truth, I think I am better able to help them navigate it than I ever was as Archdruid of the Grove. I am wiser perhaps, but I am certainly happier. Hardships are rare and diminished when you are where you truly want to be."
Halsin,Truly? I never would have guessed that is what happened. And to think I believed I had the measure of you... but I am glad to be wrong - the children shall be captivated.
Halsin,"Even with a few little white lies, rest assured that they shall be engrossed. Thank you."
Halsin,"Ah, but the glory can be found in the telling. The children love tales of underdogs, facing odds most unlikely. They shall appreciate your story, trust me."
Halsin,"Yes, I thought I caught the scent of a wolf upon the wind... the children shall love this, but be warned - they may insist upon a visit."
Halsin,"You are stalwart, even in service of darkness. There will be a lesson there for me to impart to the children... with a few details glossed over, perhaps. Thank you."
Halsin,I shall be honoured to speak of you to the children. To embrace change as you have shall make for a stirring example. Thank you.
Halsin,Countless tales have begun with a roaming adventurer - I am sure I shall keep the children enthralled for years to come with your exploits. Thank you.
Halsin,"Oak Father preserve you - I hope you have a tight hold on the beast. But this shall make for a most stirring tale for the children. I may even have to tone down the details, for fear they get too excited..."
Halsin,"Ha! I think some of the more bloodthirsty children will relish this, thank you."
Halsin,"I see... well I trust your sources, of course. Perhaps the historical record can survive an embellishment or two, for the sake of the children. In any case, you have my gratitude."
Halsin,"Why, Master Dekarios, I had no idea you would continue to stoke the fires of adventure. I commend you - as shall the children, once they hear of your exploits. Thank you."
Halsin,"Well luckily for you, mortals have a habit of embellishing their run-ins with gods... I am sure I can muster something to captivate the children from what I can glean of you."
Halsin,"The makings of the multi-night epic. The children shall rush to their bunks in order to hear the next chapter, thank you."
Halsin,A noble calling. Your tale shall inspire a whole generation. Thank you.
Halsin,"The classic tale of the Blade, but with a twist? This shall go down very well with the children, I sense. Thank you."
Halsin,"Many of the children have already heard of you, as it were - do you know some of them scarcely even believe this old bear could be acquainted with such a hero?"
Halsin,"But the authentic sense that your recollections bring to the tale shall win them over, no doubt. Thank you."
Halsin,"Thank you, the children shall be agog. I do believe some of them use the number of beastly fangs and claws present in a tale as the yardstick for its quality - which puts yours right at the top of the heap."
Halsin,A classic tale. I expect it shall inspire more than a few of the children to start practising their ripostes with wooden sticks.
Halsin,"A formidable duo. I am glad that you and Karlach have each other - it shall serve as a strong lesson for the children, as well as a stirring tale."
Halsin,"I am glad you and Karlach have an enduring friendship - it shall serve as a strong lesson for the children, as well as a stirring tale."
Halsin,"Sanguine joys, no doubt? Perhaps I shall smoothen out some of those details - the children do not need to know the full truth of your diet. But they shall be rapt all the same, thank you."
Halsin,You know where to find me. Take care.
Halsin,I'll be right here in camp. Take care out there.
Halsin,Wherever you need me.
Halsin,Hmm... it seems the way to camp is unavailable to me just now.
Halsin,"All these months, and I haven't been away from what we built together. There's a whole community out in Thaniel's realm that has never known a day without our presence."
Halsin,Being away from it... I cannot help but worry how they will fare in our absence.
Halsin,"I hope so. The children shall miss their bedtime tale tonight - though perhaps I can glean a few new stories from our friends here, to make up for it."
Halsin,"Tell me... are you happy with the path we tread together? I took you from a life of high adventure, to one  that can be described as anything but."
Halsin,"I thought perhaps that seeing everyone once again, and hearing of all that they have been doing... it might awaken some regret, about the life we lead. You could have done anything, gone with anyone... yet you chose me."
Halsin,I am glad to hear it. Forgive an old fool in need of a little reassurance. I am still expecting to stir from the dream.
Halsin,"You jest, but I caught the scent of some honey mead as we arrived - even I may be tempted to indulge a little."
Halsin,It is a special occasion after all. Just haul me away should you find me bare-chested and singing the songs of my ancestors.
Halsin,You must be eager to speak to some of the others. I shall be fine - do not allow me to keep you.
Halsin,"Be sure to take your own advice - this is a special night, for all of us."
Halsin,"It is not for me to boast - it was a shared effort to reclaim the stones of Moonrise and Reithwin, and build something new. I am just lucky to be a part of it."
Halsin,"Myself included - we have all shared in this bounty. But I take your point, and shall acknowledge my role. In brief."
Halsin,"Hmm, perhaps I shall have to take the form of a mouse and hide myself away."
Halsin,"I appreciate the nudging, all the same. We serve as a good pair, you and I."
Halsin,Of course. Seeing them free and happy may be my proudest achievement - and now they have more playmates than they could ever wish for.
Halsin,"I thought I would... but in truth, no. Roaming has lost its lustre now that I have somewhere I truly belong."
Halsin,"Perhaps my true nature was waiting to reveal itself, with your aid. I just hope you share in my contentment."
Halsin,"You are right, of course. What we have made shall outgrow us both, and Oak Father willing, stand as our legacy..."
Halsin,I just hope the children get by without me there for their bedtime stories...
Halsin,I was eager to attend tonight... yet I cannot help but fear that it may be a mistake. Do you know what I speak of?
Halsin,"Perhaps, but words alone are not enough..."
Halsin,"In that case, nothing more needs to be said. Farewell."
Halsin,"It would not go amiss, if you are willing."
Halsin,"Hmm, well, I can only hope I don't disappoint."
Halsin,I'll help however you wish.
Halsin,So do I. But one duty at a time.
Halsin,"So, I'll remain with you - if you'll have me, that is."
Halsin,"Honestly, I never thought I'd make it that far. But the Absolute is a threat to all, and I promised I'd help you with your parasite."
Halsin,"At least now we can benefit from her presence, and perhaps work to a common goal."
Halsin,I cannot help but wonder how she would have handled some of the challenges I faced as Archdruid. Would she have helped the refugees? Defended the grove? Controlled Kagha?
Halsin,"Rest assured, my arms shall be ready."
Halsin,Apologies. You can probably understand my eagerness. I shall be as gentle as a feather next time.
Halsin,"Well, I am not normally given to imbibing, but this is a special occasion, and I believe our dear Withers procured a fine honey mead as part of the celebratory victuals..."
Halsin,Even the most ascetic of nature's servants would be tempted by such an elixir... But that can wait. Your company is what truly drew me.
Halsin,"True, we cannot. But we can make a future that bests even the fondest of memories. Then, each reunion shall be all the sweeter."
Halsin,"And who is to say we need to make such gatherings a rare occasion? My hearth is yours to warm yourself beside, always."
Halsin,"You are right, of course. I am accustomed to dwelling on the past, even when it brought me nothing but unhappiness. You changed that, and gave me the most precious of memories. "
Halsin,"Now the task is to make yet more of them, so that each reunion shall be all the sweeter.<br>"
Halsin,"Perhaps that is so for you, but for me? It may be that a peaceful life after so many years of tumult has made me sentimental."
Halsin,"I dwell upon what we shared: that bond was forged in a crucible that can never be stoked again, Oak Father willing. It is a bond that can weather any distance, any passage of time."
Halsin,Our differences are insignificant compared to our shared experiences and achievements. We are a rare breed - we should let bygones be bygones.
Halsin,I was just about to ask the same of you - I'll admit I am curious to hear how you have been occupying your days.
Halsin,"See, that was scarcely a hardship for either of us, was it? Now tell me, what have you been up to this past while?"
Halsin,The shadows were concealing a true adventurer's heart then. Thank you - the children shall be rapt.
Halsin,"I shall not falter from what must be done, but I cannot ignore what I see, either."
Halsin,I outgrew cynicism around the age of 200. I offer no apologies for my desires.
Halsin,"Yes, and so it must remain. I wish you success on your path. Had things been different, I might have walked it with you."
Halsin,This isn't what I wish. It's simply the way it has to be - I'm sorry.
Halsin,"This place needs me. I wish it were different - I truly do. As long as the curse remains, so must I."
Halsin,"Out there the curse still thrives. I failed this place - now I must remain behind, and stand watch over it."
Halsin,"Very well... Oak Father, shield me in the trials to come."
Halsin,"You prevailed, my friend. Now your path takes you to Baldur's Gate... but I cannot join you."
Halsin,"If you can find this place, I'll wager it will reveal a path to Moonrise Towers, bypassing the worst of the shadow curse."
Halsin,"Oak Father protect you, my friend! You shall weather this trial, I know it!"
Halsin,The local customs are... veiled to me. Are you sure this is wise?
Halsin,Must keep low.
Halsin,Out of sight. Let it remain that way.
Halsin,Good... nothing to see here.
Halsin,"You need help, my friend."
Halsin,There must be some way to stop this.
Halsin,"That contraption looks set to kill you, not save you. Get clear of it, at once!"
Halsin,Let me get you back in the fight.
Halsin,"Hold on, I shall aid you."
Halsin,"I need you battle-ready, my friend."
Halsin,Unseen as a stalking cat.
Halsin,"No. If you linger, you'll only jeopardise your own mission. This is my burden alone now until either the curse is lifted, or I breathe my last."
Halsin,Why is that daubed fellow being forced before a crowd like so? Is he being punished? Ritualised humiliation?<br>
Halsin,"The same. I had hoped I might have been able to stay by your side, to help however I could. But the Oak Father has spoken - my place is here."
Halsin,"As do I. Be safe. Seek peace. Let nature guard you and provide for you. And know that there are those who will keep you in their hearts, always."
Halsin,I wish it could be so... but a new task awaits me.
Halsin,"You do. But I fear the world is ignorant to its debt, at least for now."
Halsin,Because you are wise. You know the fear and mistrust that can grip people's hearts all too easily. There are cruel limits to who they can accept as their saviour.
Halsin,I thought that last night would have proven otherwise. I know your true nature. It is still there. It still intoxicates me.
Halsin,Do not torment yourself with paths not taken. You did what was necessary.
Halsin,Study... hidden... Emerald Grove...
Halsin,Secret tunnel... entrance hidden... Selûne temple...
Halsin,Curse... made of shadow... all succumb to it... find another way...
Halsin,Unknown... powerful magic... Moonrise Towers...
Halsin,Someone controls the parasites... controls the cultists...
Halsin,Altered... arrested... unnatural magic...
Halsin,Captured... goblins... drow... killed...
Halsin,Halsin... First Druid...
Halsin,"Look for life in the darkness. Wildflowers, where everything else is dead. The curse cannot subdue the power Thaniel bears. Not entirely."
Halsin,"Gladly. Let's put an end to this, once and for all."
Halsin,"What stayed behind would have been the strongest part of him. But after all these years left in darkness, corruption must have taken hold."
Halsin,"Thaniel rests still, but it's no easy slumber."
Halsin,"I will miss you, my friend. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day, if the sun ever shines on this place once more."
Halsin,This shall not do.
Halsin,"But still... we had best make your introduction carefully, and gradually. After all they have been through, I would hate to frighten the children - and the adults, for that matter."
Halsin,Aid is at hand.
Halsin,I need you in the fight.
Halsin,To sacrifice so many would be an abomination.
Halsin,"All those lives snuffed out, just to grasp some power. That was craven - unnatural."
Halsin,Good - they deserve a chance at life. Nature will handle their fates from here.
Halsin,All these lives at stake... we cannot allow this to happen.
Halsin,Your scars... I see them all. They tell a painful story.
Halsin,"Stay your hand, Astarion. To sacrifice so many is a tyrant's ambition."
Halsin,Your power is buoyed by a sea of innocent blood. I hope you are pleased.
Halsin,A wise choice. Let nature determine their fates.
Halsin,But I must move on. Nature demands that I do.
Halsin,I sense there is little else to be said or done here.
Halsin,"No, that is not right. My body is but a vessel to serve nature with. To take pride in it is to indulge in vanity."
Halsin,"A fair assumption. Perhaps not the truest answer of all, but still in good judgement."
Halsin,Gladly. We each know the other's heart to the fullest - there is little to fear here.
Halsin,By Silvanus' mossy beard...
Halsin,"Stay with me, my love."
Halsin,Suits you.
Halsin,Ssh... our little secret.
Halsin,I need you at the peak of your powers.
Halsin,"It is true. Nature suffered, while I dawdled, and allowed myself to be distracted."
Halsin,"I had high expectations, but even still, I am impressed. You may know me better than I know myself."
Halsin,You understand me almost perfectly. Only my late mother may have bested you.
Halsin,An... unfortunate result. Perhaps we should not have partaken.
Halsin,"We shall prevail, my friend."
Halsin,I need you at your peak.
Halsin,"Keep strong,  my friend."
Halsin,All foes shall wilt before us.
Halsin,This will help your wounds.
Halsin,I shall heal you.
Halsin,Do  not give up.
Halsin,Let me help you.
Halsin,"Nature is my true love. You, I merely tolerate."
Halsin,"You flatter me... but also overestimate our bond, I think. Perhaps there is another you can turn to."
Halsin,I suppose we've braved greater dangers together than public embarrassment. Do as you wish.
Halsin,"I thought you may have bestowed the honour on someone else. But if this is what you wish, so be it."
Halsin,Scholarly pursuits are important... but my heart lies elsewhere.
Halsin,"This is the truth - I live for the wilderness. Comfort is for the farm animal, snug in its pen."
Halsin,"Mindless gorging...? No, that is not right. I did not realise you thought that of me."
Halsin,"A source of pride, true. I can think of greater feats, but that one is cherished all the same."
Halsin,"This is the truth. I sense I will never surpass that moment, when nature awoke from its nightmare."
Halsin,"No, you are mistaken. Rejecting unwanted advances is no failure, even if it earned me some scars."
Halsin,"No... that wasn't my most glorious moment, but my greatest failure? Far from it."
Halsin,"Do not worry, my friend."
Halsin,"Let us try. It would be a sorry dream that does not make room for all who would wish to partake in it. Nature will find its balance, and if we are worthy, it will provide us with harmony."
Halsin,"A new start must be without limits, or otherwise how would we ever know what we are capable of?"
Halsin,"That would surely test even the most open-minded... yet, perhaps I am wrong to hesitate."
Halsin,"Are you sure? Holding back is not in my nature, but I would not wish to alarm you, or harm you."
Halsin,"We were as one. The warmth of your skin, the feel of your..."
Halsin,I am open to anything - if you can find a piece of furniture that is up to the challenge.
Halsin,"I had heard the municipal laws regarding large animals had been struck down... but still, perhaps we were wise to not push our luck. This time."
Halsin,And I see plenty to lose myself in.
Halsin,"No, don't say that. Perfect would mean there is nothing left to explore. "
Halsin,"I would still be there with you now, if the sun hadn't intruded on us, and the city hadn't stirred for the day."
Halsin,"That was something I had dreamed about for some time... and now I realise just how woefully meagre my dreams were, compared to the reality."
Halsin,As I discovered. It isn't so often that the bear is the one being eyed hungrily.
Halsin,"I am glad you have reconsidered, but please don't trivially bring up such difficult topics. My heart can be wounded just like any other."
Halsin,I warned you to not broach such matters lightly. Perhaps you care less for me than I supposed...
Halsin,Why would you test my patience like this? Sometimes it is difficult to love you.
Halsin,"I will remain by your side whenever you wish, of course. As ally, advisor, friend... in any way you desire, save for as a lover."
Halsin,"Then... very well. This chapter is at an end. I can only hope you have many more, each filled with happiness."
Halsin,"I see... if that is truly your desire, then I shall respect it. No matter how much I wish it was not the case."
Halsin,"You have said as much to me before, only to change your mind. I told you your heart is your own, but I do not wish for mine to be toyed with. Are you certain?"
Halsin,"Was there something else you wanted, my heart?"
Halsin,Come here to me...
Halsin,Does it please you to see me crestfallen? That is the only reason I can think why you might toy with my heart like this.
Halsin,Perhaps fate will afford us more time together - I hope it does.
Halsin,"Nor I. At my age, I've come to see that little is worth regretting in the long run, apart from regrets themselves."
Halsin,I can imagine. You rode out the storm most admirably.
Halsin,"Yes... I hope so. But we have a battle to win, before any of that."
Halsin,"Listen to me, preaching like an initiate in his cups."
Halsin,"I wish... I wish there was a better way. I wish everyone could see the sun, have a full belly, and know nature as a friend. There is a balance that is yet to be found."
Halsin,"All that potential is too often destined to die in the dark, and rot in the gutter."
Halsin,...and still it draws them in. The safety of numbers. The promise of civilisation. The dream of better. 
Halsin,The city is like a forest with an overgrown canopy. Light and nourishment cannot penetrate to those who need it the most... 
Halsin,"Still, though... this place crawls with life, but little of it flourishes. I see refugees, unhoused. The destitute, unwanted. Orphans, unloved."
Halsin,"The city, you mean? With all its noise, smoke, stone, and bustle? I would not be here, given the choice... but I promised you my support. And that is what you shall have."
Halsin,"But in either case, it seems I was insensible for much of my ordeal. Small mercies."
Halsin,"Impressive that she managed to move my bulk, come to think of it. I wonder how that was managed."
Halsin,Just my pride - I can't believe I allowed myself to be knocked unconscious and spirited away like that...
Halsin,Oak Father preserve you.
Halsin,"I trust your leadership, and respect your decisions... but I truly hope this is not something we come to regret."
Halsin,"I hope this does not prove to be a mistake, my love."
Halsin,"When I first met you, saving yourself from ceremorphosis was your greatest wish... yet now you have stepped closer to embracing it."
Halsin,Of course.
Halsin,"Perhaps our time has not yet come. Perhaps dealing with the Absolute must come first. Whatever you decide, I will understand."
Halsin,"A short night, at that. I am sorry if I came on too strongly. Take all the time and space you require."
Halsin,Of course... That is your right.
Halsin,I was hoping you would ask...
Halsin,"Indeed, I am but one of your lovers. You and I should each seek happiness, wherever it lies. You are all I want, but I will not hoard you to myself. Let others know the happiness of being with you."
Halsin,"Relationship? Such terms belong to civilisation - a little unfamiliar to my lips. You know what we share is more fluid, more founded in the principles of nature."
Halsin,"You should feel free to roam as your heart desires. You are all I want, but I will not hoard you to myself. Let others know the happiness of being with you."
Halsin,"This need not be a parting, so long as you fight on. You and I can each roam apart, until nature compels our paths to cross once again."
Halsin,"Do as you must, as shall I. We shall meet again. It is as sure as the break of dawn, or the spring thaw."
Halsin,"You are afraid because you are alive, and you have something to lose. Hold on to that."
Halsin,"I have responsibilities. People who are counting on me. But perhaps given time, their roots will grow strong enough that they can stand without me. "
Halsin,"If this is what you truly want... I shall respect your wishes. But know that you shall not die - not truly. Nature's realm shall be yours. In the air, the trees, the waters."
Halsin,"You shall live on. And wherever I go, I shall feel your presence, and you mine."
Halsin,Karlach - you are in pain. Do not say otherwise. It is writ large across your face.
Halsin,"And so you shall, as soon as you come to visit - there will be much for you to see, and not a soul among our numbers who will not wish to praise the saviour of Baldur's Gate."
Halsin,"We are each free, as we always were... but that does not need to be the end. "
Halsin,"I wish we had been afforded more time together, but there is so much to do in the wake of the Absolute's defeat, and precious few hands with which to do it."
Halsin,I cannot. No matter how much I want to. 
Halsin,"When we joined battle for the last time, I did not want to presume we would survive. I assumed it might cost us our lives in order to save nature's realm."
Halsin,I thought that would be the steepest price that could be asked of us. But I was wrong.
Halsin,"You made a choice that would cause most to tremble. You made a sacrifice far greater than merely laying down your life. Your whole future, utterly altered. The world is in your debt, and I am in awe of you."
Halsin,"You need to remove yourself from that danger - go wherever you can find solitude, peace. Nature's realm is vast - it shall provide a place where you can be yourself."
Halsin,"A sorry prize, yes. One that I wish was not so... but the world has a narrow view of who can be its saviour."
Halsin,"But I know what you did. I shall not forget, and I shall make it my purpose to tell all of what you did for them."
Halsin,"I can start to do so almost immediately - the wars of late have left many with nowhere to turn... Many lost their families, their homes - some never had them to begin with."
Halsin,"Perhaps in time, I can trust them to meet their saviour. Perhaps you can come to visit us, and be treated with all the reverence you deserve. That day may be distant. But I shall do everything in my power to hasten it."
Halsin,"I could seek you out, or you could return to me, if Avernus were to yield a cure. "
Halsin,You are right. But such... drastic times can make it difficult to preserve nuance in one's thinking. Further reflection is needed.
Halsin,"At least... for now, they depend on me. But perhaps given time, their roots will grow strong enough that they can stand without me. "
Halsin,"You can still save yourself, Karlach. You can return to Avernus. It need not be forever. Just long enough to give yourself a chance."
Halsin,"We have challenges to surmount, of course, but with you by my side, my heart stays strong."
Halsin,"This place is... not for me, perhaps. But with you by my side, and the shadow curse a fading memory, I shall keep my head high."
Halsin,"This city troubles me... but I am here for you. I want to be by your side, and see this through."
Halsin,"My mind still drifts to that dream I shared with you, for a better future for all those who need it... but that must wait. I remain yours, of course. Ready when you need me."
Halsin,"With the end upon us? So long as I am surviving, and I have you by my side, I am faring as well as anyone can be."
Halsin,You wish to speak? I am here for you.
Halsin,All of nature's bounty pales next to you. Do you need something?
Halsin,"Speak to me, lover."
Halsin,My heart soars just to look upon you. What do you need?
Halsin,"Thaniel still needs our help - part of his essence must still be out there, somewhere."
Halsin,"We should return to camp when we can - I must see how Thaniel is faring. With the Oak Father's blessing, the shadow curse may soon be no more."
Halsin,"It is done - now Thaniel will be whole again. I could not have done this without you, my friend."
Halsin,"Then I will watch the horizon for you each day, and fix your image in my mind each night, until I feel your touch again."
Halsin,"You are right, of course. There are no mistakes in nature - it is all a grand tapestry beyond mortal reckoning. "
Halsin,"You live your life, and I shall live mine... but forgive me the odd hopeful glance towards the horizon, in search for you."
Halsin,Have no fear. I am exceedingly patient.
Halsin,"I see... After all my years of living, I know all too well that nothing lasts forever. Yet a parting can sting, nonetheless."
Halsin,"But that just means what we shared was precious, and will live on in my memory. Thank you - I am a richer man for having met you."
Halsin,"Of course - somehow I'd hoped for a miracle. But of course, the only miracles are those we make ourselves."
Halsin,To Avernus? The land of lost souls...? I cannot. There are people who depend on me now.
Halsin,"My. Perhaps a tale for the older children, once I trim off a few of the... less savoury details. But thank you, all the same. "
Halsin,"In a manner of speaking, yes... Though it is a more complex, evolving beast than I could ever have anticipated. True balance is no simple, fixed thing. I see that now."
Halsin,You are truly incapable of disappointing. The children shall be rapt - and have no fear; all due credit shall be given to the tale's originator.
Halsin,"Indeed? I had feared a life in service of Shar might have narrowed her mind, but I am glad to be proven wrong. There is more to her than even she knows, I feel."
Halsin,"Indeed? Perhaps it was naive of me to even wonder if she would mind. Her culture arose from the distant fringes of nature, after all. But it gladdens me, all the same."
Halsin,Truly? This is most welcome news. She must be as strong in spirit as she is in body.
Halsin,"Somehow, I am not the least part surprised - but I am glad."
Halsin,"Did you find time to speak with your partner? A potentially delicate topic, I understand."
Halsin,Is this truly what progress looks like?
Halsin,I... you are right. I cannot repeat her mistakes.
Halsin,Thank you - your wisdom shines through even in dark moments. I shall not give in to despair. Not while there is still the chance of a future worth fighting for.
Halsin,You speak nothing but the truth. The Shadow Druids' words are meant to inflame those already given to anger and helplessness - I do not want to join their ranks.
Halsin,A fine point. I wish I had thought of it myself.
Halsin,"Indeed. But I cannot shake it from my mind, all the same..."
Halsin,"I do... but at times like this, it can feel like an impossible dream."
Halsin,Sometimes it is difficult to see exactly what we are fighting to save here. Sometimes it feels like Kagha was right - nature can only survive away from all this...
Halsin,"Sometimes it is difficult to see exactly what we are fighting to save here. Sometimes the Shadow Druids' desire to separate nature from all this seems pragmatic, not fanatical..."
Halsin,"Her will is strong - even now, she defies the bounds of the material plane. She will prevail."
Halsin,You saw how they wished to burn the clothes of a child? As if being crammed in this very city is not the cause of lice and disease?
Halsin,"Unnatural steel beings patrol the streets, the printed word sows discontent, and those in need are treated with disdain."
Halsin,"I had hoped there might be a greater sense of balance within the city - that its walls might enable sheltering within it to foster community, peace... yet it is not so."
Halsin,I was all too eager to surrender my responsibilities towards the grove... and now it has been sealed away from the world. Perhaps I was never meant to be Archdruid - to be a leader.
Halsin,This is welcome news. Most welcome.
Halsin,"Indeed. But I have roamed far and wide for years - whole lifetimes. I have seen much, done much, learned much. It would be a shame to not pass that on."
Halsin,"Now we will have each other, but not just each other. Our hearts are free to roam, together or apart, as nature designed."
Halsin,"Now? Now I need to restrain myself, until we are afforded a quiet moment. Seek your bedroll when you are ready - but do not expect much sleep."
Halsin,Moonrise Towers. Many druids and Harpers died to take this place once... only for Ketheric Thorm to rule it once again.
Halsin,Orin has made off with Gale - we must rescue him... unless you wish to kill Gortash for her.
Halsin,Vampire spawn assailing us in the night? I thought we had ample troubles as it was. At least Astarion is safe.
Halsin,"Vampire spawn assailing us in the night? I thought we had ample troubles as it was. At least you are safe, Astarion."
Halsin,Our work is not yet finished - not until Ketheric Thorm's last breath flees his corpse. Let us pursue him.
Halsin,This orb... Gale carries a most dire burden. I wish he had shared it with us sooner.
Halsin,"You carry a most dire burden inside you, Gale. I wish you had shared it with us sooner."
Halsin,Astarion... he has ascended amongst the ranks of the undead. I can only hope that he does not come to regret the price that he paid.
Halsin,A cruel parting of ways with Shadowheart. I can only hope the allies we have won will be worth our betrayal.
Halsin,"A shame that Minsc had to die. I sense he could have been an ally to us, had circumstances been different."
Halsin,Zevlor turned to darkness in his desperation... but he did not deserve a fate such as that.
Halsin,Of course. Take your time - some things should not be rushed.
Halsin,Go to your bedroll when you're ready. But do not expect to get much sleep.
Halsin,"In either case, I will remain by your side for whatever you need of me. Until the very end."
Halsin,Still... I could not have forgiven myself had I not taken the plunge. Better to have tried and failed.
Halsin,"I understand, and I still cherish our relationship."
Halsin,"I cannot blame them. It is understandable why someone would want to keep you all to themselves, even if it is not my way."
Halsin,"Now? Now you must rest. For the moment that engine of yours is fixed, I doubt you'll be getting very much sleep at all."
Halsin,"The feeling is more than mutual. Now: you must rest. And in the morning, we must get that engine of yours fixed. The moment I am able to touch you will be... memorable. For us both, I hope."
Halsin,The feeling is more than mutual. Seek your bedroll when you are ready - but do not expect much sleep.
Halsin,A temple dedicated to Shar. More than a temple perhaps - a proving ground. This must be where Ketheric Thorm grew his dark-cloaked ranks.
Halsin,I thought that would be the case once... yet perhaps the grove will not need me.
Halsin,Forgive me. The shadow curse occupied me so entirely and for so long... I almost miss the purpose it gave me. Now I must find a new one.
Halsin,"Ah, there it is. That is what I have been missing."
Halsin,"Now, we have much to catch up on. Do not allow me to ramble on - I am eager to hear all you have been doing."
Halsin,"In that case, very well. "
Halsin,"Our community grows rapidly; in six months, we have turned what was once a shadowy wasteland into a true home for all. In another six months, I would wager the scars of the past will be entirely invisible even to those who remember them."
Halsin,"The old masonry of Moonrise Towers and Reithwin have been repurposed into new homes, and the land is rich with harvests and bountiful trees. Nature and civilisation are in harmony, stronger together."
Halsin,"It is, truly... though a more complex, evolving beast than I could ever have anticipated. I spoke often of balance before; only now do I realise that balance is no simple, fixed thing."
Halsin,"We welcome folk from all walks of life - anyone who wishes for a new start. Naturally, it can be chaotic at times, but it is a thrilling sort of chaos. It thrives in ways I could never have dreamed of."
Halsin,You are welcome whenever you like and for however long as you please.
Halsin,"As am I. I may age more slowly than most, but I do believe I've gained some new laughter lines of late."
Halsin,"Now please, tell me all, and spare no details. I shall not lie - I have an ulterior motive in wishing to hear all. It is the children, you see. My charges."
Halsin,"Please, spare no details. I shall not lie - I have an ulterior motive in wishing to hear all. It is the children, you see. My charges."
Halsin,"Their appetite for bedtime tales is greater than I could ever have anticipated: 'Another story, Daddy Halsin, another!' is the chorus that greets me each nightfall."
Halsin,"They have all but exhausted my repertoire in but a few short months - no mean feat, given the lifetime I have lived. I desperately need new material, please. My reputation is at stake."
Halsin,"Ha! You would ask to be tucked in next. But whatever the intrepid adventurer needed, I would have been glad to provide."
Halsin,"More than a few, I should think. At least I shall be equipped to explain the birds and the bees when the time comes, but I hope that time is quite a while off yet."
Halsin,I am all ears. Though I never cared for that phrase. A rather unsettling image...
Halsin,"You have kept yourself busy - I expected no less, in truth."
Halsin,"I shall be able to keep the children enthralled for a few more nights yet, thanks to you. And should you wish to retell of your exploits in person? Well, I shall not object to a night off."
Halsin,"Now, it would be cruel of me to hoard you all to myself for the evening, as much as I would like to. I shall leave you to the others for now, unless there was anything else?"
Halsin,How thoughtless of me. Come here...
Halsin,"As am I. I can scarcely imagine life without your company now, and of course I made a promise to help you - one I intend to fulfil."
Halsin,That was more than worth the wait.
Halsin,"I know it can, for I feel the longing for old friends in my heart each day."
Halsin,"Still, though... I cannot help but wonder if there was more I could have done. Perhaps, Oak Father willing, I may yet have the chance some day..."
Halsin,I was all too eager to surrender my responsibilities towards the grove. Perhaps I was never meant to be Archdruid - to be a leader.
Halsin,"That is where true leadership lies - not in winning a single vast battle, but in fighting a thousand smaller ones. Making ten thousand difficult decisions. Finding balance, where none seems possible, day after day..."
Halsin,One grand victory may not be enough to absolve a host of small failures.
Halsin,There have been difficulties - some initiates harbour too much admiration for Kagha's course of action. Francesca will do what she must to rid them of such notions.
Halsin,"Wounds have healed, damage has been undone... balance has been restored. Those who seek to serve nature there can once again do so, with all their hearts."
Halsin,"She is well-suited to the task - better than I, perhaps. To cleanse a land of shadows is one thing, but to sway a heart from a dark path is another matter entirely..."
Halsin,Francesca has found some initiates still yearn for the false promises the Shadow Druids peddled. She has been working hard to show them the error of their ways.
Halsin,"The Shadow Druids. Their scheming was stopped, thanks to you... yet their malign ideals can find purchase and live on, even after the instigators themselves are vanquished."
Halsin,"My chosen successor, Francesca, has proven to be a wise choice. Perhaps the wisest I ever made as Archdruid."
Halsin,"I received a dispatch from the grove. Life carries on there in our absence, just as nature intended."
Halsin,Devastation beyond measure... We must prevail. We must heal the damage that has been wrought.
Halsin,"It truly is splendid to see everyone gathered together again, if only for a night. I hope the sun does not make haste to rise on us."
Halsin,"You would think someone of my vintage would be inured to the passage of time, yet these past six months have seemed endless without your company. But now our paths cross once more..."
Halsin,"... Just as I hoped they would, more like. The Oak Father has been kind to me this past while, yet I cannot forget the bond we all forged together."
Halsin,"In any case, my audience will favour a good tale over veracity any day - I thank you for your offering."
Halsin,"It is one that can weather any distance, any passage of time. I know it can, for I feel the longing for old friends in my heart each day."
Halsin,"We have all pined for each other's company, I sense. I cannot imagine otherwise, after what we shared."
Halsin,"That bond was forged in a crucible that can never be stoked again, Oak Father willing. It is a bond that can weather any distance, any passage of time."
Halsin,"I always do. Should I ever decline, assume a doppelganger has taken my place."
Halsin,"Quite often - they come and go as they please, but with so many playmates to avail of, they are far from strangers."
Halsin,"The belly of the city. How many people are born, live, and die within these walls without ever seeing the depths of nature's beauty for themselves? I shudder to think."
Halsin,There is something foul to to air here - it reeks of madness and death.
Halsin,It seems Gale has made amends with Mystra. I see this as a good omen for what awaits us.
Halsin,Alfira died badly. I can only hope the others that share this campfire do not share her fate...
Halsin,Will Orin truly free Lae'zel if we slay Gortash? I am not so sure... a rescue may be in order.
Halsin,"I am sorry, Gale. You tried. Mystra was wrong to turn on you, no matter what mistakes you made in the past."
Halsin,"A pact made with Raphael will surely bring nothing but misfortune, as much as I would like to be proven wrong."
Halsin,Shadowheart truly is Shar's instrument now. At least perhaps her new dark-cloaked followers can help in the fight against the Absolute.
Halsin,Shadowheart... you truly are Shar's instrument now. At least perhaps your dark-cloaked followers may prove of service against the Absolute.
Halsin,Wyll intends to take the fight to the very Hells themselves? I can think of no one more capable.
Halsin,"You are taking the fight to the very Hells themselves, Wyll? I can think of none more capable."
Halsin,I fought proudly alongside Harpers once... but it seems we cannot place our trust in them now - not while Orin has their ranks infiltrated.
Halsin,"Shadow magic, Gale...? No matter how desperate times become, you should not defile yourself with such foul matters. You are better than that."
Halsin,Mystra would ask for Gale's life in return for forgiveness...? A cruel demand to make of a mortal.
Halsin,"It may be some centuries before my flesh is ready to yield, but I hope I shall be bold enough to follow in her path, when the day comes."
Halsin,"Jaheira's wisdom is plain to see. One of the greatest ways in which you can serve nature is to surrender your body back to it, when the time comes."
Halsin,Mizora schemes with Wyll's very freedom. He deserves to know what she is up to.
Halsin,"Mizora has something planned for you, Wyll. I could see it in her eyes... and I fear it does not bode well."
Halsin,"Yet, she fears there are none to inherit her work, so she goes on. Long life can be a burden at times - I know that well."
Halsin,"Jaheira's wisdom is plain to see. She understands that to truly serve nature, you must one day surrender your body back to it."
Halsin,"Vlaakith's words have set Lae'zel's mind, it seems. I would not wish to be the one that the Lich Queen unleashes her upon."
Halsin,"I thought your faith in Vlaakith was unshakeable, Lae'zel. Perhaps Voss will prove to be a more worthy ally."
Halsin,"Your queen's words have set your mind then, Lae'zel? I would not wish to be the one that Vlaakith unleashes you upon."
Halsin,I thought Lae'zel's faith in Vlaakith was unshakeable. Perhaps Voss shall prove to be a more worthy ally to her.
Halsin,"I can already sense the first stirrings of new life in the land. The grip of the curse is weakening - now we must break it, once and for all."
Halsin,"Not a decision you have made lightly, I trust. You have my support, no matter what."
Halsin,What are you thinking?
Halsin,"But let us not forget that we also have the Orphic Hammer. We could free Orpheus, let him wield the stones - if we can trust him."
Halsin,"Karlach has offered to take up the mantle. I think you should let her have her wish. Her time is short, but she can live on in all the hearts of those she will have saved."
Halsin,"So, only a mind flayer can wield the stones, if you trust the Emperor's word. "
Halsin,"So, only a mind flayer can wield the stones, if you trust the Emperor's word. You are already part-illithid, but this is a whole other matter..."
Halsin,A lair of undeath - most unnatural. We must tread carefully.
Halsin,"A curious discovery, this place. This city builds and builds upon itself, until it forgets its own secrets."
Halsin,"Defying a goddess, Gale? And one you have known so intimately? I hope you do not come to regret this."
Halsin,Last Light fell because you could not control the violence in your heart. All those people perished because of what you did to Isobel. You must try harder. You must be better. 
Halsin,"Wyll sacrificed his own father... a hard choice, but not one that is unknown in nature. At times, a seedling must strangle the very tree that bore it, if it is to survive."
Halsin,"You made a hard choice, Wyll. But not one that is unknown in nature. At times, a seedling must strangle the very tree that bore it, if it is to survive."
Halsin,Poor Gale... but Mystra is wrong about him. Perhaps he can yet prove that.
Halsin,"I am sorry, Gale... but Mystra is wrong about you. Perhaps you can yet prove that."
Halsin,"Shadowheart's true nature won out in the end, no matter how much Shar tried to bury it. It gladdens my heart to see a family reunited."
Halsin,Shadowheart. To turn from Shar cannot have been easy... but having your family by your side shows you did what was right.
Halsin,The final battle is upon us. May the Oak Father grant us victory.
Halsin,"For so long, we have fought the Absolute... only to now learn you were once one of its masterminds? There is nothing we can take for granted."
Halsin,I had hoped you would shun Bhaal's overtures... but those hopes are dashed. To be a vessel for murder itself? I can think of few things less natural.
Halsin,"It seems you have made amends with Mystra, Gale. Congratulations. I see this as a good omen for what awaits us."
Halsin,"Lorroakan hunts powerful game - too powerful for him, perhaps. Dame Aylin should be informed that yet another ambitious fool lusts after her."
Halsin,Karlach's rage is like a force of nature. I pity those who bear its brunt.
Halsin,"Wyll sacrificed a great deal for his family. The pact may stand, but the strength of his character is clear."
Halsin,"Mystra has forsaken Gale entirely. A crushing blow... but he is strong enough to persevere, I think."
Halsin,Astarion... you have ascended amongst the ranks of the undead. I can only hope that you do not come to regret the price that you paid.
Halsin,A pity. I sensed a love of nature and animals in her. There may have been more to her than even she knew of.
Halsin,"I am unsure if Shadowheart would have remained committed to the darkness, if put to the test... but we did not afford her the chance to decide."
Halsin,"Shar's ire has shaken Shadowheart... and yet she goes on. There is untold strength there, I feel."
Halsin,"You faced the scorn of a goddess, and still draw breath. That is an uncommon feat, Shadowheart."
Halsin,Those vampire spawn made off with Astarion. It shall fall to us to rescue him.
Halsin,A hammer capable of shattering the bonds in the Astral Plane? That sounds like something we should seek out.
Halsin,"A city within a city, older as you go deeper. Much like the rings of a tree."
Halsin,"Karlach has had her mortality defined to her in most cruel terms... I do not know if we can help her, but perhaps we can at least be there for her."
Halsin,"Gale, you truly thought to turn to shadow magic, after seeing how it has ravaged nature? Your ambitions are... disquieting."
Halsin,I was never afforded a chance to start a family of my own - serving nature always had to come first.
Halsin,"Jaheira's family is a credit to her - she is wise to keep them secret, safe."
Halsin,Astarion resisted the allure of Cazador's would-be powers - and I am glad of it. Whatever he would have gained would have come at a great price.
Halsin,You resisted the allure of Cazador's would-be powers? I am glad. Whatever there was to gain would have come at a great price.
Halsin,Gale defied Mystra herself. I hope he does not come to regret it.
Halsin,Shar sought rob Shadowheart of her family - of her true nature. But no more. Now the  healing can begin.
Halsin,"You were wise to turn from Shar, Shadowheart. Now your family is restored, and the healing can begin."
Halsin,"Orin has taken Yenna. We must free her - either by force, or by paying for her freedom with Gortash's life."
Halsin,Shadowheart... fulfilling your parents' wishes took courage beyond measure. I hope true peace finds its way to you swiftly.
Halsin,"Your rage is most impressive, Karlach. If the lesson is to not provoke your temper, consider it well-learned."
Halsin,"A cruel task fell to Shadowheart... but she did as her parents wished. She has my eternal respect, and I hope she soon finds peace."
Halsin,"It is no small thing, to defy a goddess. Perhaps the darkness is not Shadowheart's true nature."
Halsin,"You sacrificed a great deal for your family, Wyll. The pact may stand, but the strength of your character is clear."
Halsin,"Gortash's bluster will no longer assail our ears. And we have his Netherstone also - soon we shall unravel this unnatural conspiracy, once and for all."
Halsin,That... creature you changed into. I pray to Silvanus that you have it under control. 
Halsin,This place is unnatural in ways I cannot truly fathom - a vile celebration of death without purpose.
Halsin,"I cannot imagine how you are feeling, Gale. For a goddess to ask a mortal to pay such a price... I am sorry for, for your burden."
Halsin,"We allowed Astarion to sacrifice so many, only to just turn on him soon after? We should have stopped him sooner."
Halsin,"Mizora dead... and Wyll, doomed to the Hells. Oak Father, lend him your strength."
Halsin,"I cannot imagine how you are feeling, Gale. For a goddess to ask a mortal to pay such a price. I am sorry for, for your burden... though I wish you had told us of your predicament before."
Halsin,"Minsc has great heart - we shall need the likes of him, for the trials to come."
Halsin,Minsc believes a doppelganger to be Jaheira? He is being manipulated - I am all but certain.
Halsin,"Karlach... I am sorry. I shall not try to soothe you with gilded words, but know that I am here for you."
Halsin,"Once, you would have to sway hearts in order to raise an army... but with this place? Any tyrant could lay claim to legions of artificial killers."
Halsin,"Your self-discipline has been rewarded, I think. Perhaps Mystra is more invested in your survival than you might believe..."
Halsin,"Lae'zel's faith in her queen is unshakeable, it seems. I just hope Vlaakith recognises that."
Halsin,"Your loyalty stands to you, Lae'zel. I can only hope Vlaakith recognises it as I do."
Halsin,"It seems that Wyll's determined to remain the Blade of Frontiers. I suppose he's truly earned the moniker, now."
Halsin,"So, you've committed to being the Blade of Frontiers. None can doubt you've earned the title. Well done."
Halsin,"Nature cares little for nobility - it is pure artifice - but I can still hold some respect for Wyll's accomplishment. He shall be a fine Duke, I am sure."
Halsin,"Nature cares little for nobility - it is pure artifice - but I can still respect your achievement, Wyll. You shall be a fine Duke, I am sure."
Halsin,"To defy a goddess is no small thing, Shadowheart. Perhaps the darkness is not your true nature."
Halsin,"They ask after you often. What you did for them will never be forgotten - I can see it in the land all around me, but more importantly, I see it in their faces whenever they visit."
Halsin,I warned you - told you this was my burden to carry. Why didn't you listen?
Halsin,"Ornaments, utensils - and ducks. I like ducks."
Halsin,You are... nothing if not inventive. I can only hope the foe had already expired before you began your work.
Halsin,"Ah, but there are no pets in nature - only companions. Though I'll admit Crag likely made for a rather stoic confidante..."
Halsin,Is that so? Would you seek to drizzle honey on a neck before indulging?
Halsin,"Ha! Talented from the beginning, then? Almost a surprise you didn't cast magic in the womb."
Halsin,I shall need to think on it for a while.
Halsin,But it heartens me to learn you and I share the same admiration.
Halsin,Ha! Pet ownership is an illusion - nature's creatures choose their own companions. No one has true mastery over them in the end. As it should be.
Halsin,"I think I know how you feel... duty, eh? I hope your wish comes true. We'll need new life once all this is over."
Halsin,Luckily there's nothing small about getting to know someone like you. There's little occasion for frivolity in nature - I can appreciate your stance... even if others do not.
Halsin,"Thank me by returning the favour, why don't you? Come on - I've sure you've got something better than carving wooden ducks."
Halsin,That was amazing.
Halsin,350 years young. I've been privileged to watch saplings grow into mighty boughs.
Halsin,You're right. Sometimes I think people look at me and imagine my feelings can't be hurt.
Halsin,"Well they are fierce creatures from what I understand... but as long as you avoid the high seas, I think you can consider yourself safe."
Halsin,That was terrible.
Halsin,"I like what I like. Once you get to my age, you realise there's little point in denying yourself, so long as others aren't affected."
Halsin,What would you like to know?
Halsin,"I know, I know; well-trodden territory. Well, let's see... I whittle in my spare time, and I've something of a sweet tooth - though everyone's very amused when I say I like honey."
Halsin,Let us talk later.
Halsin,"Hmm, I suppose you wouldn't be shocked to learn I love animals and nature?"
Halsin,"The same's true of everyone, I find."
Halsin,"Well, I didn't pick this scar up in battle. I was in wildshape, only I forgot it was the season when bears are particularly social. A she-bear claimed me as her own - and did not appreciate being spurned."
Halsin,"Right now? I bed down alone, I'm afraid. Perhaps once I talk less of curses and parasites, my fortunes will improve."
Halsin,"I'm 350 years old. Of course there have been lovers. Just because I love nature doesn't mean I'm betrothed to it. Though sometimes, nature needs reminding..."
Halsin,I hope so. But I won't turn my back on the past - it made me who am I today.
Halsin,"It was a long time ago. The wounds don't heal, but they become more bearable."
Halsin,"Save for me, my line perished a long time ago. They rest in High Forest now, near the shade of the Grandfather Tree. The grove became my family, with Silvanus as my teacher. And now, I have you."
Halsin,"You're not a doppelganger, are you? Trying to study me, learn all my secrets so you can take my place?"
Halsin,Not just now. I need a moment.
Halsin,I'm afraid there's not much I can say - I've sworn confidence to someone already.
Halsin,You wish to speak? Fine.
Halsin,What do you want?
Halsin,"Thank me by returning the favour, why don't you? Come on - I've sure you've got all sorts you could tell me."
Halsin,"Oh. Well, your choice, of course."
Halsin,"Druids and Harpers joined together to put a stop to Ketheric Thorm. We marched on Moonrise and, after much fighting, we prevailed."
Halsin,"Even in defeat, though, Ketheric turned to Shar. Not long after we sealed him away in his tomb, the shadow curse took hold. No one had seen the likes of it before. No one knew how to react..."
Halsin,...Then it started to claim all those within its reach. Those who had survived the battles now fell to the shadows - became part of the shadows. And worst of all... I lost contact with Thaniel.
Halsin,"I wanted to try and find him, but we couldn't stay - we would have all succumbed. When the Archdruid of the Grove - my predecessor - was seized by the curse, I had to lead the survivors to safety."
Halsin,That was my first day as Archdruid. An inauspicious beginning.
Halsin,Indeed. I know that all too well.
Halsin,You're right. But the work is not yet done - not while Ketheric Thorm still draws breath.
Halsin,You're right. I should not let the failures of the past sour the victories of the present. We have achieved something immense here.
Halsin,I will never forget your part in this. Nor will Thaniel.
Halsin,"I see... Foolhardy, perhaps, to reveal such a thing to a veteran of battles against Shar worshippers. Foolhardy... or brave."
Halsin,"I have no love for your goddess, or the foul things she unleashed upon nature. But I can appreciate your honesty. There is nobility in your conduct, if not in your allegiance."
Halsin,"A Shar worshipper... I see. It can't have been easy for you to tell me such a thing, given my history. But I am glad you took the plunge."
Halsin,"A Shar worshipper... I see. Perhaps you feared how I would react, but still... you should have told me sooner."
Halsin,"You were not even born when Shar's followers slew my fellow druids, or when her shadow curse tainted the land. I can get past those... but I truly wish you had trusted me sooner."
Halsin,"You are lucky that we share common purpose. In most other cases, this revelation would put us on opposite sides of the battlefield."
Halsin,"No... nothing of the sort. But that is not to say it isn't connected. Best be careful, all the same."
Halsin,"The urge to kill is common in nature - for some creatures it is the core of their being... Still, though, you seem to speak of a darker impulse. Be careful how it manifests itself."
Halsin,You are a mortal child of Bhaal? Be careful with whom you share that fact - I hear many of your kind have met premature ends.
Halsin,And a hard-won freedom at that. Well done.
Halsin,"Nature bows to none. It will fight on and survive, no matter what madness your god has inspired you to undertake."
Halsin,It seems like you've no room for me just now - and I take up no small amount of space.
Halsin,Then you'll have me. Lead on.
Halsin,We need to keep our guard up - those brigands got too close to use for my liking.
Halsin,Nature has been most kind to let me share in your heart. What do you need?
Halsin,You truly are a feast for my eyes - nature outdid itself with you. Did you wish to speak?
Halsin,I have longed to hear your voice. Speak to me.
Halsin,"What word, my love?"
Halsin,I knew then that I had to be more than a companion to him. I had to be a protector.
Halsin,"It was Thaniel, of course. Nature was my very first friend. I get older, but he hasn't changed a day."
Halsin,Any time.
Halsin,"It's a natural question, but I don't have a good answer, I'm afraid. Perhaps there's a half-orc buried somewhere in my ancestry."
Halsin,Do you truly even need to ask? Of course! Who could not open their home to a befeathered hero of Baldur's Gate?
Halsin,I know we can. Think of all that we've already survived. Our foes should quake to see us approach them.
Halsin,"All this devastation... but we shall prevail, my love. We shall vanquish this blight, and watch the healing unfold."
Halsin,And I did promise the children I would bring them back a surprise... imagine their faces.
Halsin,I was just thinking the very same.
Halsin,If only we could stay like that forever.
Halsin,Your embrace makes me feel safer than any armour could.
Halsin,I could get used to this.
Halsin,"It's true, and I can't imagine I helped with that. Sometimes I let the task at hand consume me, and people think I'm obsessed. "
Halsin,"Don't worry yourself about what I think just yet - we may not have spent much time in each other's company yet, but I joined you because your judgement seems sound."
Halsin,Honestly...? I'd hoped for more from you. But perhaps things can yet be turned around.
Halsin,I shall never tire of that.
Halsin,Nor would I.
Halsin,"Just a token to remember me by. Now I've taken up enough of your time - go on, enjoy the festivities. We can speak again later."
Halsin,"No. It's wooden. I suppose it burns if you find yourself in dire need of kindling, but I hope it does not come to that."
Halsin,"I had a friend when I was young, long ago. He played with me in the forests where I grew up... but eventually, I realised no one else had heard of him."
Halsin,"Given the circumstances? You're faring as well as can be expected, I suppose."
Halsin,"Victory eludes us, my love. But let us press on - the stones may have failed us, but this is not over while we still draw breath."
Halsin,...but honestly? You've surpassed even those. Seems my faith was more than well-founded.
Halsin,The day I weary of those lips is the day I weary of life.
Halsin,"Yet they always find their way back to where they belong, just like old friends find themselves back in each other's company."
Halsin,"Ducks are my favourite, but I thought they were particularly fitting in this case. They are migratory birds of course, travelling far and wide with the turn of the seasons."
Halsin,I was hoping you'd ask.
Halsin,I've been unfair to you - I've had unrealistic expectations of your character ever since I joined you...
Halsin,"Before you go, I have something for you - just a little keepsake really. Do you remember how I told you I like to whittle? I made this..."
Halsin,"Even Kagha may yet find true balance, thanks to her influence."
Halsin,"Kagha was beyond saving, but the others have a true mentor now. And I am very glad for them."
Halsin,You are more intoxicating than any fare this gathering has to offer.
Halsin,A cruel choice lies before you. I can only speculate how you must feel.
Halsin,"Trust me, it's been said. You've shown more restraint than most in avoiding the subject until now."
Halsin,"Well... that is your choice to make, of course. Though I hope the sentimental value may win out over the temptation of a few coppers..."
Halsin,Who is to say? Perhaps there's a half-orc buried somewhere in my ancestry? 
Halsin,"Oh, I am well aware, trust me. Now I've taken up enough of your time - go on, enjoy the festivities.<br>"
Halsin,I want to talk about what happened.
Halsin,"I had hoped the stones would have ensured our victory by now, but it was not to be. Let us press on - this is not over while we still draw breath."
Halsin,"This is it, my friend. One last battle to decide all..."
Halsin,Or perhaps not - sometimes I think conventional wisdom is too narrow about what someone can or cannot be. Stranger things have most certainly happened.
Halsin,I spend half my days in ursine form - the children demand it! I had a score of them taking turns riding upon my back just days ago.
Halsin,"On occasion, but I prefer not to interfere. Francesca of the High Forest is Archdruid now, and by all accounts, she has proven to be a steady and wise influence."
Halsin,"But I know that you, above all, are sure to make the right choice."
Halsin,"Now I've taken up enough of your time - go on, enjoy the festivities. We can speak again later."
Halsin,"To make a child smile is to dabble with the power of gods, as far as I am concerned."
Halsin,Of course. But it shall not be the last...
Halsin,"Nothing remains for us here. Let us leave, and seek out the final reckoning."
Halsin,We shall triumph. Our time together does not end here.
Halsin,"The end is upon us, my love. One last battle to decide all..."
Halsin,"I am glad they are so comfortable with the Oak Father's creations, but they must learn that not all are as amiable as I am. A lesson for another time though; they deserve some joy."
Halsin,"The sight is unnatural, but I can look past the form, to the spirit within. You did this for all of us - I am indebted, not repulsed."
Halsin,"As for roaming... that impulse has dwindled, I must admit. Perhaps because I have found where I am meant to be."
Halsin,As did I... but somehow I feel like I no longer need to roam - that I have found something worthy laying roots for.
Halsin,"Amazing, what can be discovered about oneself, even at a ripe old age."
Halsin,I am?
Halsin,"Trust me, the day I no longer have to talk about the shadow curse will be a happy one. What would you like to know?"
Halsin,"The end is upon us, my heart. One last battle to decide all..."
Jaheira,Something we can use?<br>
Jaheira,Just observing.
Jaheira,Shake off the dust.
Jaheira,Got it.<br>
Jaheira,Bits and bobs.
Jaheira,"Hush this fussing, you're fine."
Jaheira,Looking.
Jaheira,Still some way to go.
Jaheira,"What can a worm teach others but how to crawl? Shadowheart has no need of your 'instruction', Viconia."
Jaheira,"I imagine she will have something to say about the matter. If we must return, let it be with blades bared."
Jaheira,Done.<br>
Jaheira,"They're dead, Entharl. Doppelgangers were using them as bait."
Jaheira,Pay me no mind...<br>
Jaheira,There.<br>
Jaheira,A little further.
Jaheira,Only because I can no longer bear to look you in the eye.
Jaheira,Silvanus soften my steps.<br>
Jaheira,On the trail.<br><br>
Jaheira,Stalking.<br>
Jaheira,Malar's mark. How many more Harpers dead?
Jaheira,"I'm glad you're safe, Entharl. My Harpers - they were replaced by doppelgangers."
Jaheira,Eyes to yourselves.
Jaheira,Shelves stuffed with overpriced arcane trinkets. This place would whet Gale's appetite something fearsome.
Jaheira,Alive. But he'll need some time to recover.
Jaheira,"You toss allies aside so easily, after everything? If you are so eager to join this worm, then may you both be buried here together."
Jaheira,"Mind who you call history, hollyphant."
Jaheira,Hm?<br>
Jaheira,Boots worn through.
Jaheira,Work to be done.
Jaheira,Still a fight to win.
Jaheira,"Always poking, prodding, trying things out...<br>"
Jaheira,"Nature's servant, and yours.<br>"
Jaheira,What about... this.<br>
Jaheira,Let us see.
Jaheira,Would you hand her over to have her wings pulled off by this self-inflated wretch?
Jaheira,"Aylin is a friend - to whom we owe our lives, I would remind you."
Jaheira,As I'm told.
Jaheira,What about this.<br>
Jaheira,"You get to my age, you have already done everything. Be my guest."
Jaheira,Do not parley with this madman.
Jaheira,"What's this, then?"
Jaheira,Simple enough.
Jaheira,Alive. But a Harper no more. He's better off out of it.
Jaheira,Am I to sneak up and say 'boo'?
Jaheira,"Swiftly, if you please. These knees do not bend easily."
Jaheira,Always nice to be wanted.<br>
Jaheira,Nature's servant awaits.<br>
Jaheira,"...A very formal greeting, Geraldus. You are well?"
Jaheira,"At your back, always."
Jaheira,Show them the warrior I know.
Jaheira,I can spare a moment.
Jaheira,"Come, let us free the bard from his adoring fans. And their rather accurate charges."
Jaheira,Come. You're tougher than that.
Jaheira,Care for a bedtime story while you're at it?<br>
Jaheira,"Of course we'll save you, Volo. I think this mob has made the rather silly mistake of taking you seriously."
Jaheira,"Oh come now, you cannot be spent already?"
Jaheira,Still alive? Good.
Jaheira,Not done yet.<br>
Jaheira,"Turn your gaze, lest I turn it for you..."
Jaheira,Ssssshhh.
Jaheira,Speak. Up.
Jaheira,Perhap afterwards.
Jaheira,Steps light as falling leaves...
Jaheira,"Nature's servant, still waiting."
Jaheira,"Oh my, you found me.<br>"
Jaheira,"Did I snap a twig, or a toe?"
Jaheira,Another step on the path.
Jaheira,Just like that.
Jaheira,Don't jump.
Jaheira,Ugh - the elder brain works its will through the worm. What other tricks has it learned?<br>
Jaheira,Time to get you moving again.
Jaheira,Allow me.<br>
Jaheira,A little something from the shadows.
Jaheira,Go!<br>
Jaheira,Tempted as I am to leave you behind...
Jaheira,"Turn around, and walk the other way."
Jaheira,Best not to draw attention.
Jaheira,Take my hand!
Jaheira,Oakfather lends his aid.
Jaheira,Doesn't she remind you of our old friend Marcus?
Jaheira,You do not fight alone.
Jaheira,Let me see what can be done.
Jaheira,Always more to be done.
Jaheira,Only ask.
Jaheira,"And you, Harper - there is something familiar about you."
Jaheira,"I understand, Geraldus. Take a moment."
Jaheira,Ever-ready.<br>
Jaheira,Taking a breather? How nice.
Jaheira,Unseen.
Jaheira,No time for this.
Jaheira,Now?
Jaheira,Be we predator or prey?
Jaheira,"You can turn off the charm, Entharl. They're with me.<br>"
Jaheira,Show them how to fear.
Jaheira,Eh.
Jaheira,I suppose I've faced worse.
Jaheira,I'd rather go into battle bare of ass.
Jaheira,Something to say? I doubt it.
Jaheira,Oh. Joy.<br>
Jaheira,Oh no (!). You're bleeding.
Jaheira,A few bruises - so what?
Jaheira,What - you want to me kiss your knee and make it better?
Jaheira,Hold. Still.
Jaheira,"You can turn off the charm, Entharl. He's with me.<br>"
Jaheira,"You can turn off the charm, Entharl. She's with me."
Jaheira,Afraid not.
Jaheira,Continue the hunt.
Jaheira,Ugh - the elder brain works its will through the worm. What other tricks has it learned?
Jaheira,Get moving.
Jaheira,What are you doing over there?
Jaheira,Cannot always go in plain sight.
Jaheira,Quietly as I can.
Jaheira,Lest my old bones creak.
Jaheira,Hunting.
Jaheira,The others will be taking their ease here. Entharl has been known to shelter Harpers when they need it.
Jaheira,Let's get you loose.<br>
Jaheira,No time to slow down!
Jaheira,Let me loosen that snare a little.<br>
Jaheira,"'The Blade of Frontiers'. A long way around just to finish where you started at, Wyll."
Jaheira,I wouldn't say that. We've travelled a long road together in a short time.
Jaheira,"Entharl's no Harper, and claims no love for those who are. But he's been known to shelter us when we need it."
Jaheira,I missed you too. They're already here?
Jaheira,I am coming!<br>
Jaheira,Any surprises?
Jaheira,Aye.
Jaheira,On your feet.<br>
Jaheira,Fight!
Jaheira,Get in there.
Jaheira,Stand together or fall apart.
Jaheira,"The fire was his own fault. Bad enough he was adding silkroot to his brews - but he stored it poorly, too."
Jaheira,"That's her sigil on your ring, is it not?"
Jaheira,"Oh, but surely we're safe with one of Nine-Fingers' big strapping boys to protect us. "
Jaheira,Silvanus strengthen your hand.
Jaheira,Let me smooth the path a little.
Jaheira,None shall see.
Jaheira,Any aid these old bones can lend.
Jaheira,We can use that.
Jaheira,You hardly need my guidance any longer. You've done so well.
Jaheira,"Well you certainly have the 'omnipresent' part down, don't you?"
Jaheira,"My, such strong wrists."
Jaheira,"I would poke you back, but I fear that's what you want."
Jaheira,"Oh, calm down. I'm happy to see you too."
Jaheira,A fine scar to lie to your children about.
Jaheira,"Ah-ah - I am not done with you, yet."
Jaheira,As good a moment as any.
Jaheira,Why not?
Jaheira,Let's take a look.
Jaheira,Loot?<br>
Jaheira,"Serene she might seem, but nature has claws!"
Jaheira,Blood it shall have to be.
Jaheira,For the fallen!<br>
Jaheira,I take no joy in this.
Jaheira,The mark of Malar on you!
Jaheira,We do what we must.
Jaheira,I will try to make it swift.
Jaheira,It is already over.
Jaheira,"Careful, or I will take your toy away from you."
Jaheira,"Anything helpful? A great big axe, perhaps?<br>"
Jaheira,Something to aid in the fight.
Jaheira,Always come to this.
Jaheira,Only the worms have use for you.
Jaheira,Please go poke the ranger instead.
Jaheira,Nature will not even notice you are gone.
Jaheira,Just time for a little browse.
Jaheira,You sully the ground you stand on!
Jaheira,I send you to Eldath's embrace.
Jaheira,This wandering eye will be the death of me.
Jaheira,Better you feed the soil!
Jaheira,No steel can save you.
Jaheira,"Your choice, not mine!"
Jaheira,Can't take long.
Jaheira,I'm sure I have not lost the knack.
Jaheira,Time has not hardened my hands just yet.
Jaheira,Taking a look.
Jaheira,Haven't sprouted roots just yet.
Jaheira,Scouting it out.<br>
Jaheira,Just a little foraging.
Jaheira,"Poking, prodding..."
Jaheira,Aye aye.
Jaheira,"You can stand, so you can carry on."
Jaheira,What have we got?<br>
Jaheira,Do what must be done.<br>
Jaheira,This ought to be good.<br>
Jaheira,Yes?<br>
Jaheira,"What's this, now?<br>"
Jaheira,I'll take it.
Jaheira,This will do.
Jaheira,How high?<br>
Jaheira,"I may not have claws, but I make do."
Jaheira,Shake it off.
Jaheira,Coming.
Jaheira,Better than barging it down.
Jaheira,"No fussing, you're fine."
Jaheira,"If you can stand, you can carry on."
Jaheira,"I can mend your wounds, if I must."
Jaheira,Your own fault.
Jaheira,"Ready and waiting. Well, certainly waiting.<br>"
Jaheira,Be free.
Jaheira,"Call, and I answer."
Jaheira,Haven't abandoned you yet.
Jaheira,Rooted to the spot.
Jaheira,Let's shake you loose.
Jaheira,Haven't left you yet.
Jaheira,Mm?
Jaheira,Did you think I had abandoned you?
Jaheira,On my way!
Jaheira,Claimed.<br>
Jaheira,"Would that I could hide from you, too."
Jaheira,"Well, if abandoning you isn't an option..."
Jaheira,You are hardly worth it.
Jaheira,For the fallen.
Jaheira,"Do you know, I think we have given offence."
Jaheira,No better moment.
Jaheira,Red in tooth and claw.<br>
Jaheira,Consider my hackles raised.
Jaheira,Orders?
Jaheira,Onward.<br>
Jaheira,You do not walk alone.
Jaheira,"Funny as it is, I won't leave you like this."
Jaheira,No pinning you down.
Jaheira,Let me see what I can do.
Jaheira,Hmph. A proper circus would provide some fruit to throw.
Jaheira,Ah-ah - no rest just yet.
Jaheira,"Still standing, no matter what you heard."
Jaheira,You have still have time to surrender.
Jaheira,Always the same old song.
Jaheira,"I'm flattered, but pick another. Watching the dryad make you cry will be entertainment enough."
Jaheira,"Hm? Oh, the dryad is comely enough - but you? Don't poke at questions you don't want the answer to, cub."
Jaheira,Death greets us all - but not today.
Jaheira,The work is never done.<br>
Jaheira,"Wherever we go, ye gods let there be something green."
Jaheira,Let me guess - you need something.<br>
Jaheira,Here.
Jaheira,Let us show them how it's done.<br>
Jaheira,What's a little rummage between foes?<br>
Jaheira,I was just going to take it from your corpse anyway.
Jaheira,Much obliged.
Jaheira,"You don't mind, do you?<br>"
Jaheira,Sticky. I hope that is blood.
Jaheira,And I thought we were going to be friends.<br>
Jaheira,Watch your elders and learn.
Jaheira,Let me make it easy for you.
Jaheira,"Out of necessity, nothing else."
Jaheira,You need all the help you can get.
Jaheira,Pointed ears primed.
Jaheira,Something to say.<br>
Jaheira,What's going on.
Jaheira,Nod and smile.
Jaheira,"Well, hello there."
Jaheira,Going.
Jaheira,"Talk, talk, talk."
Jaheira,The smallest of small talk.
Jaheira,Time for the niceties.
Jaheira,We need to speak.
Jaheira,"Dry those sweaty palms and let us try this again, shall we?<br>"
Jaheira,"I thought you were tougher than that. Well, no - I didn't."
Jaheira,"Rise, or don't. I care not."
Jaheira,Shall I lace your boots for you as well?
Jaheira,I can be social - if I must.
Jaheira,"Argh, my knees! Oh. It was a twig."
Jaheira,Hello there.<br>
Jaheira,The hard way it is.<br>
Jaheira,Ugh. If I must.
Jaheira,Let me help.
Jaheira,You will be well.
Jaheira,None shall die today but those who annoy us.
Jaheira,What little herb-lore I have.
Jaheira,A fine scar to tell your children about.
Jaheira,A swift mercy.<br>
Jaheira,Talk is done.
Jaheira,"The ungentle way, then."
Jaheira,Always comes to this.
Jaheira,Blood it shall be.
Jaheira,Done.
Jaheira,When words fail.<br>
Jaheira,Fine.<br>
Jaheira,Claws out.
Jaheira,Perhaps it will help.
Jaheira,At your command.
Jaheira,I ought to leave you behind.
Jaheira,"The burden of your blood is yours to carry, but you need not carry it alone."
Jaheira,You will be protected. Even from yourself.
Jaheira,"You first. I find that sleep escapes me, so I might as well take the watch."
Jaheira,No need for such dramatics. I will go with eyes wide open - and the hope that I know you a little better than you know yourself.
Jaheira,"For now, rest. Sleep escapes me, so I might as well take the watch."
Jaheira,Perhaps I was too swift to put up my blades. But we will not play into your father's hands this night.
Jaheira,"As you wish, then. We take our leave. I hope you have mastered yourself, when next we meet. If not, we will do what we must."
Jaheira,"And when you stand against him, you will not stand alone."
Jaheira,"The problem with Marcus, of course -"
Jaheira,I am truly bored of that phrase.
Jaheira,"Cast yourself into the dark if you wish. I mean to be there to pull you back - by the hand, or the scruff."
Jaheira,Wait. 
Jaheira,Then we shall make this swift.
Jaheira,For all the gifts Bhaal's children inherit - a peaceful night's sleep is not among them.
Jaheira,The dreams alone do not concern me. It is what waking deeds they might inspire.
Jaheira,Watch your tongue. The girl has suffered cruelty enough without heaping more on her head.
Jaheira,"Are you truly your own master? What is it you feel, when father's dreams come calling?"
Jaheira,I do not expect you to die for me. But to risk Entharl? Any citizen who might have wandered in?<br>
Jaheira,"I'm sure it felt that way, Geraldus. The others were likely dragged back to Orin. Tortured. Sacrificed."
Jaheira,"Sworn to Orin the Red, yes. We've... already had the pleasure. Go on."
Jaheira,"They were tracking you instead, evidently. Doppelgangers."
Jaheira,"An old code, Harper - but yes, you got it right. Now I need your report."
Jaheira,Selûne's Tears. It is said no false face can stand beneath their light.
Jaheira,"It is not guidance I offer, but a leash. We will help you to control yourself - until you can free yourself of these urges, and use the Slayer form freely."
Jaheira,"Punished? Meaning what, exactly?"
Jaheira,"And some explaining to do, it seems."
Jaheira,In another time - with another of your kind - we found a better way. I would dearly like to find it again.
Jaheira,"And what is it I owe? Should I allow some horror to be born anew, when I could end it here and now?"
Jaheira,There is one certain way. I hold it in my hand.
Jaheira,"Then would you call it mercy, if the next night I never let you wake?"
Jaheira,- we didn't end on the best of terms.
Jaheira,The illithids have not erased him entire. Perhaps there is hope yet.
Jaheira,"To face the other of your kind - Orin. So long as the other lives, neither of you can claim your full power."
Jaheira,"Whatever its source, the Slayer form is a weapon like any other. And if you mean to master it, I know where you must go. "
Jaheira,"You are twice-tainted, yes. But whatever you have done - you might yet serve the good."
Jaheira,This is not where you fall.
Jaheira,"I'm a herbalist by trade, Saer Fist. My assistants and I were out collecting blooms for that rub-rot going around. Nasty business. Contagious."
Jaheira,"Are we so flush with friends that you would just cast one aside? If we are to win, we need her."
Jaheira,The Fist can go hang themselves - we're getting you out.
Jaheira,Florrick? What have they done to you?
Jaheira,"Don't be so quick with your gratitude, Counsellor. All we have done is send you back into the battle."
Jaheira,"..The less subtle approach it is, then."
Jaheira,The patriars leave their guard dogs below. They must feel safe around the Steel Watch indeed.
Jaheira,"Clever cub. This is an ambush - strike first, while they focus on me."
Jaheira,"Causing havoc even now, eh?"
Jaheira,"Do you think I cannot sense you, spectre?"
Jaheira,"No Klauthgrass in the wine this time, I promise."
Jaheira,Nature's servant... enjoys light revelry.
Jaheira,"Ahh, my first night off in too many moons."
Jaheira,Argh - what are you doing - ?
Jaheira,"You've scarcely signed up, boy, and there is a war coming. Why die a Harper, when you could still live as anything else?"
Jaheira,"To most people, a rather old-fashioned greeting."
Jaheira,To a Harper - a signal that there are shapechangers in our midst.
Jaheira,But that would be a mercy. One you have not earned. 
Jaheira,"I have spent my life fighting your father in whatever form he chose to take. By rights, I should cut you down here."
Jaheira,So - what did it take to earn that new Slayer-skin of yours?
Jaheira,There we have our answer. But we might as well hear it from you.
Jaheira,Distracting you.
Jaheira,I don't - not yet.
Jaheira,"With Stelmane murdered, the Council has an open seat. How timely."
Jaheira,Almost. There is but one piece left to play.
Jaheira,"I've been sensing something, you see. A formless but familiar dread, which I have only now been able to put a name to."
Jaheira,And so I come to ask: what did it take for you to earn that Slayer-skin you hide so well?
Jaheira,There is one last piece I've been toying with. A terrible and familiar power I've sensed around you for some time.
Jaheira,"You have not confessed it all, I think. There is something in the air tonight - the scent of a terrible and familiar power."
Jaheira,Dark dreams?
Jaheira,NOW!
Jaheira,"You have not confessed it all, I think."
Jaheira,I won't let you fall here.
Jaheira,Take my hand.
Jaheira,"Death is death. To look for meaning in it is foolishness, boy. Childish, storybook nonsense."
Jaheira,A talking-to from the Grand Marshal himself. Quite the introduction to a life of crime - what did he say?
Jaheira,"They stick to sunnier streets. Heavens forbid they disrupt any of that Guild business they're so well-paid to ignore, hm?"
Jaheira,"I grieve to tell you, Wyll, they never were."
Jaheira,Shadow people roaming shadow streets. There's little more to learn down here but some depressing ways to die.
Jaheira,"A foul thing, to be bound.<br>"
Jaheira,Huh. Deep pockets.<br>
Jaheira,I should hope so - they certainly don't get paid half so well.
Jaheira,Quiet as my mouse-shape.<br>
Jaheira,It was slowing you down anyway.
Jaheira,"For a good cause, I promise."
Jaheira,You won't miss it.<br>
Jaheira,Don't. Turn. Around.<br>
Jaheira,"Huh. None of that rhymed with 'filthy, filthy cheaters'."
Jaheira,Ilmater's ashes...
Jaheira,A little lighter than before.<br>
Jaheira,No harm done.<br>
Jaheira,Your father made a fine job of polishing them up some - but a sellsword is still a sellsword. They are just following their nature.
Jaheira,I'm at your back.<br>
Jaheira,No time for this!
Jaheira,Legitimate salvage.
Jaheira,Anything useful?
Jaheira,Just looking.
Jaheira,We need you back in the fight.
Jaheira,Pop it open.
Jaheira,"A little shaky, maybe, but you're fine!"
Jaheira,Something we can use?
Jaheira,Just browsing.<br>
Jaheira,No time to slow down.<br>
Jaheira,Here - allow me.<br>
Jaheira,Ah-ah - we haven't earned our rest just yet.<br>
Jaheira,Let me loosen the snare a little.
Jaheira,Stand together.
Jaheira,A Harper uses whatever is at hand.
Jaheira,Ah. It is good to meet again.
Jaheira,"Answering to Orin the Red, then. Go on."
Jaheira,But first - Geraldus. Does your mother still own that farm in the Dalelands?
Jaheira,"For now, take what rest you can - we will watch over you this night."
Jaheira,"Those of your kind. Orin - I am sure you already know that so long as she lives, she will never stop hunting you. "
Jaheira,"You would not be the first to turn the taint in your blood to your advantage. But there are barriers a Bhaalspawn must overcome, first."
Jaheira,"Whatever path you choose, I fear it will lead you to the same point. The same enemy."
Jaheira,I've arranged a meeting with my harper informators at Danthelon's Dancing Axe.
Jaheira,We should head there as soon as possible.
Jaheira,I suppose you'll have your answer when you wake in the morning.
Jaheira,We need to find out what happened to Minsc.
Jaheira,Lets go to the basement.
Jaheira,I most humbly beg your pardon?
Jaheira,"This work isn't for everyone, boy, and there's no shame in that. Go home to your mother, and leave the task to us."
Jaheira,Not when this mess is of my making. I sent the Harpers hunting after the cult without thinking what it would mean to be hunted in turn. Now they are compromised.
Jaheira,"...Exactly the kind a Harper would spout, I suppose. Fine. I have no right to make the choice for you."
Jaheira,Doesn't even slow you down.
Jaheira,Those creatures must be eliminated.
Jaheira,"Just Jaheira to you, now. Go on - I have all the help I need. "
Jaheira,What more could you need?
Jaheira,"All I can offer is the promise that, should you choose to do so, you will not meet her alone."
Jaheira,I'll come clean. I did not tell you all about what I hoped to learn here today - I will rectify that.
Jaheira,"First, Geraldus - you're the last Harper in the city I can rely on. Lay low, and rest while you can. I have matters to discuss with my friend here."
Jaheira,"And I owe you an apology, as well. I haven't told you everything I hoped to learn here today."
Jaheira,This mess is of my making. I sent the Harpers hunting after the cult without thinking what it would mean to be hunted in turn. Now they are compromised.<br>
Jaheira,"I will not. If I bare my teeth, it is probably because you have struck at a sore spot."
Jaheira,"Eh. Knowing a devil's deal, you would retain your senses. No comfort, I suppose."
Jaheira,I suppose you do not.
Jaheira,"You speak of something you know nothing about. But then - why would you, when I have not told it?"
Jaheira,"Ever the Bhaalspawn's lot. To bring death, or wait for it to find them."
Jaheira,Karlach...? Are you well?
Jaheira,Lilarcor. 
Jaheira,I don't think I have any - 
Jaheira,Sleep well.
Jaheira,"For now, take what rest you can - I will watch over you this night.<br>"
Jaheira,Karlach...?
Jaheira,"Someday, I will sit down. I mean it.<br>"
Jaheira,"You speak with truth in your heart. Here, then. Take this. "
Jaheira,"Saer, yes saer.<br>"
Jaheira,"And so we should swoon and offer a kiss, abomination? I would not even know where to plant it."
Jaheira,No. No - you cannot do this.
Jaheira,"I confess that the last time I came here, I thought it would be my tomb. You can see why."
Jaheira,Hold a moment. We are not so short on time that we cannot stop and think about this.
Jaheira,"Whatever that thing is, it's not going to last much longer."
Jaheira,This ought to sting.
Jaheira,Let us see what this does...
Jaheira,A special surprise.
Jaheira,One way to find out...
Jaheira,See what happens.
Jaheira,Take care. Illithids evolve nothing - they only enslave.
Jaheira,"What is all this, then?"
Jaheira,If it will help.<br>
Jaheira,Come. You can keep going.
Jaheira,Up you get.<br>
Jaheira,Care for a bedtime story while you're at it?
Jaheira,"Oh come now, you cannot be spent already?<br><br>"
Jaheira,Let me help.<br>
Jaheira,Stand.
Jaheira,"He gave his life for ours, Lae'zel. You might give him the death he seeks without claiming it as some victory."
Jaheira,"Imprisoned most of his life, and he freely gave what little remained to save his people. Rare, that a hero actually lives up to their prophecy."
Jaheira,Homecomings are never easy. I fear Orpheus will find the githyanki much changed - and they him.
Jaheira,Got it!
Jaheira,A decisive end to the one whose powers protected you. I hope whatever you gain from his sacrifice is worth it. 
Jaheira,My weapons have weathered worse.
Jaheira,You have my attention - now do something with it.<br>
Jaheira,Cast your arrows elsewhere...
Jaheira,Out of sight.
Jaheira,Watch for the hidden hand.<br>
Jaheira,Silvanus soften my steps.
Jaheira,A moment to plan.
Jaheira,Take them unawares.
Jaheira,"Come now, that's quite enough bleeding."
Jaheira,Move.<br>
Jaheira,"Rise, or don't - I care not.<br>"
Jaheira,What would you like - a pat on the backside?
Jaheira,Make them think twice...
Jaheira,A turtle on its back has more heart.
Jaheira,"Oh, I almost forgot you.<br>"
Jaheira,If play-time is quite finished?
Jaheira,"Oh, you look some sort of funny."
Jaheira,"Yes, yes, have your fun. It isn't you they're trying to kill."
Jaheira,"Preparing to march, I wager."
Jaheira,Is anyone keeping an eye on those children from Elturel?
Jaheira,Find out who it is. And bring them to me.
Jaheira,Good. We'll leave soon - and we don't want any surprises.
Jaheira,"Do you know, I begin to wish they had never brought me back."
Jaheira,What? What do you want!?
Jaheira,Do you show your belly  so easily?
Jaheira,No one hides like a Harper.
Jaheira,"They'll write stories of this, of course - each fable sprouting more falsehoods than the last. But for that one seed of truth: you. You did this.<br>"
Jaheira,"Myself and the Coast entire. A debt I'm unlikely to repay in the years left to me, but I suppose I can make the effort.<br>"
Jaheira,"Would anyone else like to sit down? Lie down? Drink until we fall down, perhaps?"
Jaheira,"Right. I suppose there is more work to do, now. What first?"
Jaheira,"Another low mortal, grasping at godhood. Perhaps he will manage it, and be everything he promises - perhaps not. "
Jaheira,But he's set himself on his path. We have our own next steps to think on.
Jaheira,"That might be the smartest thing you've ever said, Gale."
Jaheira,"What do you think? Time for a quick one, before the work begins again?"
Jaheira,"What is it, wizard? There will be plenty to furrow our brows over in the morning - why not take a break?"
Jaheira,"Yet another noble sacrifice. If I didn't know you better, I would think you were just showing off."
Jaheira,"You are still full of surprises, ranger. I could not have said it better. "
Jaheira,Nature's servant awaits.
Jaheira,"Though, first - Gale. What is it you plan to do next?"
Jaheira,What does this do?
Jaheira,Prodding around.
Jaheira,What have we got here?<br>
Jaheira,Move.
Jaheira,Astarion! Get out of the sun!
Jaheira,Stop this madness!
Jaheira,Perhaps she has returned to camp. She has... much to think on.
Jaheira,Back to camp. She will not have much time.
Jaheira,Hold a moment - where is Karlach?
Jaheira,Ah-ah. This is not where you die.
Jaheira,"Which of us is greyer here, hm?"
Jaheira,A little nose.
Jaheira,A simple creed to spout. A harder one to live by.<br>
Jaheira,"A grand enough gesture to win back her good graces, I think. I wish you luck, wizard."
Jaheira,"Many of you know my name, few of you know my face. This is as it should be."
Jaheira,You 'became' nothing. I suspect you were always the self-sacrificing sort.
Jaheira,"I have never been known for my tact, but honesty is the better virtue by far. So, sincerely - thank you."
Jaheira,Ah. Well. Perhaps I speak with too much haste.
Jaheira,The work is not done yet.
Jaheira,A helping hand.<br>
Jaheira,No kissing it better.
Jaheira,You won't die - so long as I am swift.
Jaheira,Eldath ease your wounds.
Jaheira,"Come now, it's but a scratch!"
Jaheira,You'll move a little lighter now. You're welcome.<br>
Jaheira,"A humble task ahead, then. And one in which your Mystra will no doubt wish you well."
Jaheira,As you were...
Jaheira,Might as well.<br>
Jaheira,Got it.
Jaheira,One way to find out.<br>
Jaheira,"You bear a noble name, true enough Wyll. But your father built it from nothing - are you so certain people will follow you for that alone?"
Jaheira,"A title you would earn, no doubt. But I wonder if the people would be so quick to look past the horns, Wyll. Baldur's Gate is not an oasis of open minds."
Jaheira,"Oh, don't look at me. This is your charge to lead - and no better one to do it."
Jaheira,"Yes, this is the one - and just in time. There's a city to be saved."
Jaheira,I said only kind and flowery things - Harper's honour.
Jaheira,"While I draw breath, I will not let this city bleed."
Jaheira,"I buried my husband, Khalid, a hundred years ago. That wound still bleeds."
Jaheira,Don't. Turn. Around.
Jaheira,"Be a dear and look elsewhere, would you?"
Jaheira,"Open up, then."
Jaheira,Let's have a look.
Jaheira,"A man does not return from the dead and becomes impervious to arrows out of nowhere. There is magic at work - strong, arcane, and most likely necromantic."
Jaheira,"He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. We took shelter here, and were considering a full retreat - until you came along."
Jaheira,"I don't know why he's waiting, why he's not marching his army west as we speak, but as long as he remains, there's still a chance."
Jaheira,"You are that chance. Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul."
Jaheira,"Discover the source of his invulnerability. Make him mortal, so we can make him bleed. Good luck."
Jaheira,Isobel - this is -
Jaheira,"If you are who I think you are, you have a long road ahead of you. Good luck. And thank you."
Jaheira,"You were right. You tried to warn me, but I was too stubborn to listen. It won't happen again."
Jaheira,It was exactly as you reported. I can't believe I didn't see it sooner.
Jaheira,"Now more than ever, you're our best hope of making it out of here alive."
Jaheira,"We met him on the road here - commanding the army of the Absolute. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter."
Jaheira,We need you to infiltrate Moonrise Towers - no one will suspect a 'True Soul'. Ketheric's been made immortal. 
Jaheira,To arms! Protect Isobel at all cost!
Jaheira,Over here! Isobel's being attacked!
Jaheira,Where are we going? The battle is back the other way.
Jaheira,"Ketheric will not wait on our pleasure, nor jump on his sword without our aid. I go back to the battle - find me when you are ready to fight."
Jaheira,Hold every exit - let none escape to warn the army of our assault.
Jaheira,"Hold this floor, Harpers! Let none escape the tower. We're about to trap the spider in its own web."
Jaheira,We've taken the tower. No doubt its master waits to greet us above.
Jaheira,Harpers - hold this floor. Let none escape to warn the army - not until we've put Ketheric down.
Jaheira,"Here we stand in the lion's den, but the lions are you and I."
Jaheira,"Come what may, we'll be the tempest that blows clear this accursed place."
Jaheira,"Make him mortal, so we can make him bleed."
Jaheira,Once more unto battle. Once more to save Baldur's Gate.
Jaheira,"And that was no random attack - you were the target, Isobel. They know how important you are."
Jaheira,Isobel! Are you all right?
Jaheira,After such carnage you'd persist? Sometimes there's folly in such courage.
Jaheira,"Perhaps it's right that you're not. You're twice blessed after all: by Isobel and by your artefact. But as for myself, I don't see another option than to make a desperate dash back to Baldur's Gate."
Jaheira,"Chances are slim I'd survive the journey back, but if I can warn the dukes an army of Absolutists is on the march, perhaps the city still stands a fighting chance."
Jaheira,"That proud determination of yours should shame me, but it heartens me instead. Pull aside the curtain of years and I can see myself echoing your resolve."
Jaheira,"Very well, I'll join you, and when Ketheric falls, I'll be there - for us, for them, and for the ones we love back home."
Jaheira,"Thank you, truly. May you succeed where I have failed. You are the stuff of legends now. Pray that I live to tell your tale."
Jaheira,As long as there was light... But no longer.
Jaheira,"I'm tempted to take your word for it. You're twice blessed after all: by Isobel and by your artefact. But as for myself, I don't see another option than to make a desperate dash back to Baldur's Gate."
Jaheira,You... It was you after all? All along... How could I have missed such madness?
Jaheira,These many dead are yours. You will lie and rot among them.
Jaheira,Marcus has been with us since the start - they've been tracking us this whole time.
Jaheira,It is abominable that you still live - you who has cost us so much. The murderer of light.
Jaheira,You will lie and rot among them.
Jaheira,"Oh, but I do. I travelled with one such as you once. I didn't see it at first, but I do now: the galaxy of malice in your eyes."
Jaheira,Your blood is beyond hope of redemption. May it water these accursed grounds and grow the sickly roses that will mark your grave.
Jaheira,"You bluff, I call. Let's see who has the upper hand."
Jaheira,"I should end you, but my strength fails me. Perhaps I can outrun the shadows - even as I pray they will creep into the very marrow of your bones."
Jaheira,"Whether the worm in your skull overwhelms you or not, your end will be a vile one."
Jaheira,No. To let you live would be beyond cowardice. You sowed these many dead - now I will do the reaping.
Jaheira,"No. To let you live would be beyond cowardice. You sowed these many dead indeed, but now I will do the reaping."
Jaheira,Faithwarden! What happened?
Jaheira,You! What happened?
Jaheira,"These dead need not be buried. Beneath this canopy of darkness, all is one yard of restless graves."
Jaheira,"At long last, the dynasty of Thorms shall be dethroned."
Jaheira,Shadow to shadow. Soon the final reckoning.
Jaheira,"My blade will taste of your flesh, Ketheric, and so settle a century-old score."
Jaheira,A Harper must sometimes invite herself in.
Jaheira,Now? Why not.
Jaheira,A soft touch.<br>
Jaheira,"It is this, or throwing an enemy through."
Jaheira,A Harper lets herself in.<br>
Jaheira,A turn and tickle...
Jaheira,"Fled back to the shadows, no doubt. Come out, boy, or this mean old Harper might get cranky."
Jaheira,Hardly the time for soft hands.<br>
Jaheira,Anything nice for an aged old Harper?
Jaheira,Another Bhaalspawn falls - leaving only the final Chosen.
Jaheira,Lightly does it.
Jaheira,"The great Archduke is awaiting word of Orin's demise, no doubt."
Jaheira,Let's see.<br>
Jaheira,"Something useful, I hope."
Jaheira,What's inside?<br>
Jaheira,Too open. We might as well bare our buttocks to every archer within a mile.
Jaheira,"Unclaimed, I'm sure..."
Jaheira,"This must be the girl, Arabella."
Jaheira,The Netherbrain is trying to get to us. Hold yourself together!<br>
Jaheira,We are not done yet. Try again!<br>
Jaheira,Huh. That great big brain of his got him in the end.<br>
Jaheira,Just poking around.
Jaheira,Do you drink everything any petty mixer places in your hand? You must have a most colourful chamber pot.
Jaheira,Time has not hardened my hands just yet.<br>
Jaheira,I should applaud the liberation of bound creatures. But somehow I sense I will be the one cleaning up this mess.
Jaheira,"A cold kind of mercy - but mercy still, I think."
Jaheira,"Patrol this floor, Harpers. Watch the doors and watch the windows. Nothing enters or exits these rooms alive."
Jaheira,"Our host is at the top of the tower. Rude to keep him waiting, no?"
Jaheira,"It is I who follows you. But, if I must venture some advice... this is the simple part. Ketheric dies, or we do. And the Sword Coast with us."
Jaheira,"Yes, saer."
Jaheira,I'll watch our backs. Call if you need me.
Jaheira,It's all up to you now. Ketheric awaits.
Jaheira,"Going, going.<br>"
Jaheira,"...Somehow, you are making even less sense than usual."
Jaheira,What in the howling hells...?
Jaheira,Meet Minsc. He still seems very much himself to me.
Jaheira,I go where I'm told...<br>
Jaheira,At your command.<br>
Jaheira,Let's see...
Jaheira,Softly.
Jaheira,Just a turn and tickle...
Jaheira,Better than kicking it down.<br>
Jaheira,Just like when I was a child.
Jaheira,"That he is. But don't worry, we can handle him."
Jaheira,"Earthy about describes him, yes."
Jaheira,"One in particular calling himself the Stone Lord, perhaps?"
Jaheira,"You seem a little nervous, Saer Meadhoney. Had some difficult customers today?"
Jaheira,Crone...?
Jaheira,"Entombed forever beneath the city, starving and yet unable to die. True death might have been kinder."
Jaheira,Won't even slow you down.
Jaheira,"There's no way forward, only the almost hopeless retreat back to Baldur's Gate."
Jaheira,You can go another bout.<br>
Jaheira,"Gale was many things - but he was a hero, at the very end. That is how he ought to be remembered."
Jaheira,"What else? Helping, whether I ask for it or no."
Jaheira,"Do you know - I am. I have been known, on occasion, to speak ill of Baldur's Gate. But the city is more than her squalid streets."
Jaheira,"I knew an Evereskan Graycloak who would say 'Baldur's Gate will be the death of me, but I can't say it doesn't hold all of life.'"
Jaheira,The Upper City has been almost entirely rebuilt - that's where the gold is. Even the builders' scaffolds are cleared from the streets. No dust left to sneeze at.
Jaheira,"An empty throne, thanks to you. The city will not be long in burying it."
Jaheira,"The songs of my suffering will break hearts from here to the Hordelands, I am sure."
Jaheira,"If we can be discreet, I am not one to turn down a sharp mind - or an even sharper hivemind, in that case."
Jaheira,But tomorrow's problems may wait there for the moment. The city will trundle on without aid for just one night.
Jaheira,"I hope the city might call on you when needful, but you've followed enough orders for your time."
Jaheira,"I appreciate your concern for the city's defence, Lae'zel - but you are worth more than one soldier and more than ten Fists."
Jaheira,An unworthy one. Forgive me - I am simply excitable. It is good to be out under an open sky once more.
Jaheira,Do I? I don't mean to. Being a Harper is like trying to roll a jotun up a sliding glacier.
Jaheira,"Thank you, Wyll. My own daughter is in the Fist. I would not have encouraged her to join, if I did not believe in Ravengard's legacy."
Jaheira,"Uphold your watch, and I will uphold mine. Learn all you can of Bhaal, and leave record of all you learnt."
Jaheira,"I doubt it will be in your lifespan, or even mine - but you are wise to be cautious."
Jaheira,"I may have little love for this city, but so long as my family chooses to serve it - I can do no less."
Jaheira,There is much still to do. People to house. A Harper network to rebuild.
Jaheira,... well. Of course he has. I suppose I shall have to add a visit to their quarters to an already long list.
Jaheira,I suppose I am. I tried to steer them clear of my life's work - but they have chosen it for themselves.
Jaheira,While I... hover around.
Jaheira,"Of course, many of the wealthy fled the city when danger struck. Perhaps the thieves only want to lure them back. But for now their hands are busy laying bricks."
Jaheira,"Minsc has the Guild and Nine-Fingers on board. Deep down, it seems even the wicked can be moved to care for the city that made them."
Jaheira,What? So every passing pigeon can paint me all in white? Don't waste your marble.
Jaheira,The Beloved Ranger? Beloved wherever he goes - winning all sorts over to our rebuilding efforts.
Jaheira,"My first since the reconstruction began. We left quite a mess behind, but the city begins to look something like itself once more."
Jaheira,"And you've never looked more yourself. It's good to see you, Karlach. "
Jaheira,We can discuss this tomorrow. We could spend all evening chattering about where to go.
Jaheira,A toad in the form of a necromancer. I can only hope he has had the decency to die since our last meeting.
Jaheira,"Your higher form has brought with it some higher manners, then."
Jaheira,Hah! Forgive me - I am simply excitable. It is good to be out under an open sky once more.
Jaheira,"You must be glad to have Baldur's Gate back as you found it, Duke."
Jaheira,"Same twisting alleys for purse-pickers. Same wooden buildings, ready to get burnt by next year's dragon. Same cisterns overflowing..."
Jaheira,"I checked it myself. The master of masons was reluctant to release funds for work in the Outer City, but your neighbours proved... persuasive."
Jaheira,"Harpers have come from half the world over to lend aid. Farmers, masons, healers..."
Jaheira,My own son Jord has been wooed to their ranks. Already he plans crop cycles in Wyrm's Crossing.
Jaheira,"Though she spends more time locking up comrades for pocketing aid funds. They might learn a thing or two, if they don't expel her. Again."
Jaheira,Hah. How nice to be understood again. I have spent the past months bickering with builders and bankers - all to restore the city exactly as it was.
Jaheira,Honestly? Much more sitting down than I'd like.
Jaheira,But my children are more than capable of doing it. Even the young ones tire of me peeking over their shoulders.
Jaheira,"This night offers them a brief respite from me, at least. And this place, now I look at it... it is where you all spent your first night together, no?"
Jaheira,A fine spot for an adventure to begin. A fine spot indeed.
Jaheira,"Just... a little wander, perhaps. To stretch the legs. "
Jaheira,"I'll find my way back, as I always do. I admit defeat. Baldur's Gate is my home."
Jaheira,"But that is the thing about home. The only way to see it clearly is to leave and look back. For a little while, at least."
Jaheira,"I've been thinking of you, these past months of rebuilding. How we had better leave your city as you remember it, for your home-coming."
Jaheira,"The same might be said for all of us, I'd wager. But so long as our paths have thrown us together... I say we make the most of it."
Jaheira,"Be well, cub. We will speak again. But first -"
Jaheira,"Now, before this night grows any deeper -"
Jaheira,"Mistake me not, there is still much to be done. Plans to make. Maps to be frowned over."
Jaheira,"If we are nearby, we will do well to check he isn't up to anything - and I can't wait to see the shock on his face when he sees Minsc yet lives."
Jaheira,Ah - yes. Forgive me. There wasn't much time to offer hospitality with an elder brain looming over the city.
Jaheira,Which is my way of saying - I'd like to see the open road once more. Just for a time.
Jaheira,"Of course. Be sure to kick the mud from your boots before returning, then. But while you're here among the mortals, why not enjoy it?"
Jaheira,"Hell is not your home, Karlach. And if your friends do not drag you out of it, it will only be because you've freed yourself first."
Jaheira,"Karlach is lucky to have you. And know that you are not forgotten - if your friends don't drag you from the hells, it will only be because you've freed yourselves first."
Jaheira,But there will be more to discuss on that matter. First -
Jaheira,"For all your travels, I hope you have arrived where you want to be. Home, whatever that means to you."
Jaheira,"Quite a bit of climbing, then. I have no doubt the archdruid keeps you active - but perhaps you can spare the details for later."
Jaheira,But I see the flush in your cheeks when I speak of family. Perhaps you mean to start one of your own?
Jaheira,"I don't want to watch over a blood-match where the duellists call me 'auntie'. Just be careful, Bhaalspawn. "
Jaheira,"All right, Bhaal-child. It is true you are no longer what you were. You have done well for yourself."
Jaheira,"Perhaps you might write and tell me of them. And of you, too."
Jaheira,"Grey I may be, but I'm in no hurry to see any afterlife before my time. We wouldn't want to spoil the novelty, now would we?"
Jaheira,"The Harpers welcome any into their ranks, so long as their soul is willing. You've proven you have one, mind flayer or no."
Jaheira,"When you forsook Bhaal, I know you lost your only place in the world, even if it was one that you needed to lose."
Jaheira,I wished at that very moment to give you a new purpose: to invite you to the Harpers. You were ready. You were worthy.
Jaheira,"I wanted you to have time. For you to come to me, and say as you have said. To choose for yourself, rather than have a destiny thrust upon you."
Jaheira,"You will make the very best of Harpers, Bhaalspawn. Take this. The old harp of harmony. You know its song."
Jaheira,The Blade already stands for much that our order does. There is no doubt you have proven you would make one of the finest.
Jaheira,No bigger group of misfits would you find - you won't be the first stray githyanki who wandered over our hearth.
Jaheira,"I would have laughed in Viconia's face. But you? Shar or no, you have shown your devotion to the people of the Sword Coast. We do not discriminate on faith."
Jaheira,"After the tug of war the gods have played for you, you want to flee to a secular order? Hah. I can see it."
Jaheira,"For now, I give you only the most simple Harper creed - to look for the light, and watch always for the dawn. But to enjoy the night while we have it, hm?"
Jaheira,"There is usually a ceremony. Reciting of oaths, singing of songs - I'm sure we'll get to all of that as the drinks flows."
Jaheira,I have lived many lives. It is only right you be allowed to live another. Take this.
Jaheira,"I suppose I am, though they seem determined to make me redundant."
Jaheira,"Whatever you learned, Lae'zel - you were your own teacher."
Jaheira,"Agh, sentiment. With the greatest affection - I can think of better ways to sour our stomachs."
Jaheira,"And I them. But I cast a little more shade than I would like, and they are only beginning to see the sun."
Jaheira,Of course I am. Perhaps just... the long way around. It would be good to stretch my legs for a bit.
Jaheira,"Perhaps I'll wake to greet the dawn. Take a walk, and see where my legs take me."
Jaheira,"Do you, now? I never said it would be restful. First, let us enjoy tonight."
Jaheira,The druid in me hears the wisdom there. But the mother knows best.
Jaheira,Then I wish you well on your travels. You need not stay to look after the city. Duty without choice is servitude.
Jaheira,"If you really want to help, you'll get Minsc out of trouble for me. Spare me that adventure."
Jaheira,And... I vow to send them word of my own wanderings. If only to spare me Rion's wrath next I return.
Jaheira,"You are meant to be an evolved being, are you not? I'm sure you can master quill and parchment."
Jaheira,"Ha! Well, it's a relief to know a friend is there for them, in your way."
Jaheira,"And I wish you fortune in it. But for tonight, I would say we're safe to lay aside our weapons, no?"
Jaheira,"My children can make sure of that themselves, I promise you. But we come together in the spirit of friendship tonight, do we not?"
Jaheira,All right. I won't deny any willing arm for the cause. Even those who should know better.
Jaheira,"Here and now - that is enough for tonight, no?"
Jaheira,"Still, we need not begin with the fare thee wells just yet. We have tonight."
Jaheira,It won't be for long.
Jaheira,You have your place. I have mine.
Jaheira,"In walking in the sun, you have forgotten how to keep to the shadows. You would betray the Harpers faster than you could drop your pin."
Jaheira,"Gale, get you back to Waterdeep. Our archives don't need a bookworm infestation."
Jaheira,"The Harpers have a branch in Waterdeep. Show them this, tell them an old lady sent you."
Jaheira,"Is this just a ploy to read the tomes on Myth Drannor the Twilight Hall keeps, which cannot be accessed by those not sworn?"
Jaheira,I must inspect the refreshments. You never know - some ne'er-do-well might have tampered with the wine.
Jaheira,"Rion will appreciate the attention from her comrades, I have no doubt."
Jaheira,That Red Wizard is the only person Minsc doesn't seem to have a heart to forgive.
Jaheira,"He told me once that he was maddeningly in love with our last Bhaalspawn friend. Beneath sorrow, there was heart. Perhaps he is due a visit."
Jaheira,"The miserable Graycloak? I hope he has lived all this while - with a Moonblade hanging over his neck, he never expected to."
Jaheira,Just a little rummage.<br>
Jaheira,With gratitude.
Jaheira,I'll put it to better use.<br>
Jaheira,Damp. Ignoring that...
Jaheira,Harpering is not all heroics.
Jaheira,We can spare more than a moment for Gale. And more than one drink. 
Jaheira,"Were it any other mind flayer, I would put an end to this right now. But - I suppose you have earned the benefit of the doubt."
Jaheira,To hide your face from the city you saved. You see now why this hero's business is not all story and song.
Jaheira,Then you must answer. But far more deadly terrain awaits me here. Home.
Jaheira,"There is much to do, but... a drink might be nice. A seat would be better.<br>"
Jaheira,My thanks.
Jaheira,I doubt we'll ever see that face basking in the sun again.
Jaheira,"We were never bosom friends, illithid - but I owe you a debt. Be well."
Jaheira,I'll wager I can find a few helping hands. My children have not grown too old for chores.
Jaheira,"Last time I was there, I was poisoned near to death. Still, a little more restful than this place.<br>"
Jaheira,"For a time, at least. Time has taught me not to traffic in farewells - they are rarely so final as you might think."
Jaheira,"You don't mind, I'm sure...<br>"
Jaheira,"Malar's mark, what are you DOING?"
Jaheira,The bleating of a predator turned suddenly prey. Do not listen.
Jaheira,Not pinned down just yet.
Jaheira,Forward.<br><br>
Jaheira,Bring me into battle.<br>
Jaheira,"You'd best seek shelter, Astarion, and quickly. The world owes you - but the sun feels no such debt."
Jaheira,Into position.<br>
Jaheira,I will try to make it swift.<br>
Jaheira,Any advantage we can get!<br>
Jaheira,The wizard didn't live to see himself cured. He gave his life for everyone else.
Jaheira,"And the tadpoles have fallen silent, I take it? Good. "
Jaheira,"That wizard took a risk, and it looks like it paid off. The brain is destroyed."
Jaheira,There are better times for that.<br><br>
Jaheira,Not over yet!<br>
Jaheira,Stand!
Jaheira,On your feet!<br>
Jaheira,Let me help!<br>
Jaheira,"And the tadpoles have fallen silent, I take it? Good. A mind flayer wouldn't make for much of a heroic statue."
Jaheira,"We've won, but at what cost? The mangled rhymes the bards will make of your name - perhaps those are the true evil here."
Jaheira,Soft from the shadows.<br>
Jaheira,"Well, this is a bigger mess than any we made in the old days. My congratulations."
Jaheira,Head high - that's it.<br>
Jaheira,You are not so easily beaten.
Jaheira,"A reprieve from the githyanki invasion - for this day, at least."
Jaheira,"But what about you, Lae'zel, what will you do?"
Jaheira,"Come on now, you're tougher than that."
Jaheira,A little something more.
Jaheira,Just a little bite.<br>
Jaheira,The sting in the tail.
Jaheira,My weapons have weathered worse.<br>
Jaheira,Are you sure you wish to face me?
Jaheira,Stand. I know you can.
Jaheira,"Oakfather, ease my way.<br>"
Jaheira,Stalking.
Jaheira,"Are you well, Gale? This would be a bad spot to fall into a faint."
Jaheira,"...Which is also why it isn't on me either, but thanks for not lunging at me to get it."
Jaheira,It's an important scroll. I'm not chancing it falling into the wrong hands.
Jaheira,Why would I keep personal effects in my bag?
Jaheira,What? No. Stop trying to cast my scrolls.
Jaheira,I keep the real one here with me at all times.
Jaheira,It's not a safe one to cast.
Jaheira,It was. I've a fraction of my power in my prime. Made worse because that one failed.
Jaheira,"So at great cost to my powers, I put it onto a scroll. Just to give me the choice."
Jaheira,"You might know this already, but druids like myself eventually slow down their ageing. I'm not so sure I want that."
Jaheira,"Oh, absolutely. But not because any of you are in danger."
Jaheira,Let's talk more about it in my default dialogue.
Jaheira,"Well, well, well. Looks like an interesting scroll you have there."
Jaheira,"Good evening again, young Harper. Ensure you ever-maintain balance between drink, water, and nourishment on a night like this."
Jaheira,"'Safe place here', eh? Very good. That isn't one you learned from me."
Jaheira,"The man just makes friends wherever he goes, no? Fine, then. I shall keep him from jumping back through a portal in the morning."
Jaheira,Hmm. 
Jaheira,I think on the next place to visit. There is a wizard in Thay who I swore to check up on now and again...
Jaheira,"Perhaps I shall take Minsc. A return to Rashemen might keep him out of trouble... in every place but Rashemen, at least.<br>"
Jaheira,He is not permitted to return without his Wychlaran; I am surprised he asked me to go.
Jaheira,Don't even start down that path. I don't like where you're headed...
Jaheira,"Or perhaps the Rashemaar have forgotten us. It would make a refreshing change, if that is so."
Jaheira,"Do you have 10,000 spare gold, so we can bail you out, if we get caught casting magic?"
Jaheira,Why are you looking at me so? I'm enjoying myself. You look upon fun Jaheira.
Jaheira,"Tell you what, next time you get a super secret special scroll, I'll pester you about that one hm?"
Jaheira,"Cast it? That faulty thing? No, I wouldn't do that."
Jaheira,Let's just say...it's something I need to think on.
Jaheira,"Then we'd best win, wizard. If we cannot... well, this is quite the view."
Jaheira,"Too foolish for me to allow, pup. So why do I feel like you aren't asking? Ah."
Jaheira,If we are to try the stones once more - we ought to do it there.<br>
Jaheira,"Your dream visitors, I take it? I thought they would be prettier.<br>"
Jaheira,"Oh, because it wasn't quite crowded enough up here already."
Jaheira,I go hunting.
Jaheira,"I can still move fast, when I need to."
Jaheira,"No rest, be you wicked or wise."
Jaheira,Enough circling.
Jaheira,The straight path.
Jaheira,Into battle.
Jaheira,Blades bared.<br><br>
Jaheira,I think I could go another round.
Jaheira,War is an old woman's game.
Jaheira,"We're here, soldier. You're not alone."
Jaheira,This is the easy part.<br>
Jaheira,"Oh. By all means, what's mine is yours. Mind it doesn't choke you."
Jaheira,"Weird, but ok. We can talk about it in my default dialogue if you change your mind."
Jaheira,Please. Not everything is about Baldur's Gate.
Jaheira,Oh definitely. I've secretly converted to the Shadow Druids and now I plan to blow up the city.
Jaheira,Just know that one's a failed one.
Jaheira,"Thank you. When I know you better, I'll talk about it."
Jaheira,"But it won't hurt anyone, I'll tell you that."
Jaheira,Take my hand.<br>
Jaheira,Of all the beastly lairs I've had to poke my nose into - an illithid colony is still by far the worst.
Jaheira,Frankly I don't see another option than to make a desperate dash back to Baldur's Gate.
Jaheira,"Yes. I adorn the crown of the Oak Father still, and as long as I do, there's an ever so slim chance I could make it back to Baldur's Gate."
Jaheira,It is a curious creature that hides all manner of secrets. But if there's one thing that we know -
Jaheira,- it's that it knows its own kind.
Jaheira,"You should never have come here, True Soul."
Jaheira,I'm not interested in the Absolute's manipulations.
Jaheira,Harpers - cut this True Soul down.
Jaheira,It'll hurt less if you hold still.
Jaheira,I mourn for whoever you were before the Absolute infected you.
Jaheira,She's the one who protected the Emerald Grove?
Jaheira,He's the one who protected the Emerald Grove?
Jaheira,They're the one who protected the Emerald Grove?
Jaheira,"This is why we're here, you see."
Jaheira,A True Soul with a mind of her own... How is that possible?
Jaheira,A True Soul with a mind of their own... How is that possible?
Jaheira,Is this true?
Jaheira,Marcus? He's been with us from the beginning. Since...
Jaheira,Maybe yours has as well.
Jaheira,Go quietly - it'll be easier for all of us.
Jaheira,I assure you it is.
Jaheira,"Oh, but you ward something far more sinister than faith alone, don't you?"
Jaheira,In a moment.
Jaheira,"Rather more than a spot, actually."
Jaheira,You won't have to like them very long.
Jaheira,A True Soul with a mind of his own... How is that possible?
Jaheira,Ever so sorry to hear that.
Jaheira,Nervous? I've an inkling you've reason to be.
Jaheira,Kindness is too often a decoy.
Jaheira,What in the hells is that thing?
Jaheira,Congratulations. You've earned yourself the benefit of the doubt.
Jaheira,"Hear me, Harpers! All clear, at ease!"
Jaheira,"I'll not pretend to understand what that artefact is, but I'm old and wise enough to recognise a sliver of hope when it crawls out of the dark."
Jaheira,Tell me - why have you come here?
Jaheira,"Then you've found an ally in me, for that is precisely why I am here."
Jaheira,Then our interests align. We must all cure ourselves - of the entire cult of the Absolute.
Jaheira,There's food in the inn over there. Beds too if you require rest. Aloe oil in the cupboard in case the vines gave you a rash.
Jaheira,"Settle in, then come join me for a drink. You may just be the godsend we've been praying for."
Jaheira,You're just in time for happy hour.
Jaheira,Absolutely.
Jaheira,Not anymore. Not with so much at stake.
Jaheira,More or less.
Jaheira,"Strangest magic I've seen since roaming the ruins of Myth Drannor, but I can't argue with the results."
Jaheira,You sound so confident for someone who's so wrong.
Jaheira,Not good enough.
Jaheira,Bah! Vile things that befit a vile traitor.
Jaheira,You have me at a disadvantage. Let me correct that.
Jaheira,Hello.
Jaheira,I'll be the judge of that.
Jaheira,You're about to.
Jaheira,"An act of kindness, or a clever decoy. Luckily, I know how to find out which."
Jaheira,"I'll not pretend to understand why you, the enigma that you are, suddenly crossed our path, but I'm old and wise enough to recognise a sliver of hope when it crawls out of the dark."
Jaheira,How is that possible?
Jaheira,"I heard the Blade of Frontiers was a hero, not a hellspawn."
Jaheira,A count to five is all I need.
Jaheira,The great General is paranoid. Good - that means he's protecting something.
Jaheira,"He's aligned himself with mind flayers, but I cannot see what he gains. "
Jaheira,Perhaps we can force it out of him once we have him up against a wall.
Jaheira,Was there anything else?
Jaheira,"Some crusty ballad-monger, I expect."
Jaheira,"They have me slaying gods or laying with them, depending on the bard."
Jaheira,Volothamp Geddarm? That old fraud should be dust a century past. 
Jaheira,"But then, lies live forever, and he's half-made of the stuff. "
Jaheira,"You'll have to sing that one for me, when all of this is done. In any case, it was a lifetime ago by now. And for all our victories, we remain on the back foot."
Jaheira,"We fight, we die, and we just hope that when our time comes, there is someone else to take our place."
Jaheira,Find what makes him vulnerable. It remains the only way.
Jaheira,"No need of that. Every Harper is a bard unto themselves, I'm afraid."
Jaheira,That remains to be seen. Criterion number one: make Ketheric bleed.
Jaheira,Criterion two: survive that thing in your skull.
Jaheira,"There are as many versions of a tale as there are people to tell it. Let that satisfy you. And anyway, the heroics of old have done seemingly little to safeguard the present."
Jaheira,"It was a lifetime ago. And for all our victories, the world is no more balanced than when we began."
Jaheira,The same way Harpers learn of anything - poking noses where they don't belong.
Jaheira,"We sent an agent to infiltrate this cult - the latest fad among the city's bored nobility, I thought."
Jaheira,Until that same agent returned and tried to plant a knife in my neck. My first encounter with a True Soul.
Jaheira,I am glad ours ended on friendlier terms.
Jaheira,"From there, I made some inquiries of my own - saw first-hand how easily the cult could turn friend to foe, with but the twist of a tadpole."
Jaheira,And so I gathered my Harpers and came to the source - Moonrise Towers.
Jaheira,The songs would have you believe we saved the Realms entire. Perhaps we did.
Jaheira,Vaguely.
Jaheira,But if Ketheric fears her... all the better. It means whatever he's planning can still be stopped.
Jaheira,Did you learn anything more?
Jaheira,Through the grapevine?
Jaheira,It seems tales of my clemency have been greatly exaggerated. 
Jaheira,"You have not experienced my hatred, stranger. Not yet, at least. "
Jaheira,A level head. Let us see if you will get to keep it.
Jaheira,"Hah! Well I am certainly no innocent, paladin - so I'll bind you with vines a moment longer, if you do not mind."
Jaheira,"They'll last long enough, 'magic incarnate'."
Jaheira,A good start - but you've told me something I already know. Tell me something I don't.
Jaheira,There you are! I thought those vile claws dragged you into a terrible grave.
Jaheira,Always another step to go.<br>
Jaheira,Just a little further.<br>
Jaheira,"Not an option. Even if Isobel were willing, the inn would not survive without her. "
Jaheira,Lead the way.<br>
Jaheira,Rout the Absolute's poison from this place.
Jaheira,This fight is winnable. Do not stop!
Jaheira,These shades are nothing to Those Who Harp.
Jaheira,"If we fall, the Absolute wins!"
Jaheira,"That was my failing. I thought to turn their trap to my advantage, and wound up snaring us all the tighter."
Jaheira,I thought I was prepared for treachery. But an all-out assault... I blundered into their trap like a fool.
Jaheira,You have the honour of making up for my mistake. 
Jaheira,I trust that you will.
Jaheira,Discover Ketheric's secret. Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage.
Jaheira,"Gruesome, isn't it? I'm glad you survived the encounter, at least."
Jaheira,"If Isobel falls, we all die."
Jaheira,"As for you - you exposed a True Soul in our midst. You're no puppet of the Absolute, are you?"
Jaheira,"Be on the alert, Harpers! We haven't seen the last of Marcus yet."
Jaheira,So tell me...
Jaheira,"And I know my calling. I thought my grand adventures were behind me, but I should have known better."
Jaheira,My place is with you.
Jaheira,How nice to be wanted.
Jaheira,But you convinced me otherwise.
Jaheira,"We ventured into darkness together - now we've come out the other side, I'd say I'm feeling a little refreshed."
Jaheira,"When we reach Baldur's Gate, there will be even darker paths to tread. I will follow you wherever they lead."
Jaheira,"You're amply reinforced already. I'll let the new blood do all the running around, for now."
Jaheira,By your command.
Jaheira,How does it compare to a shadow-cursed inn?
Jaheira,"With the Absolute's army gone, the Risen Road should be clear - we can follow it all the way to Baldur's Gate."
Jaheira,The city needs me - the Harpers know their tasks.
Jaheira,There's a Harper safe-house in Wyrm's Crossing - Danthelon's Dancing Axe. We'd do well to check in with them before entering the city proper.
Jaheira,"One awkward evening in camp, until we are free of this place. And then you will be free of me."
Jaheira,You ventured into the heart of darkness when I could not.
Jaheira,Glad to be there.
Jaheira,"You came here in search of a cure, but found a conspiracy instead - I can see how that would be disheartening."
Jaheira,"But take courage - we have killed a man who could not die, and stripped the Absolute's army of its general."
Jaheira,Extensively. Mind flayers too - but I never dreamed of seeing gods and illithids working in consort.
Jaheira,It is most disturbing.
Jaheira,More than anyone should. But I never dreamed I'd see the Dead Three working in consort with illithids.
Jaheira,"Sarevok, Bhaal's least favourite son. Still tied to daddy's apron-strings?"
Jaheira,But do not let us keep you from your business. There is so very much sitting and sulking in the darkness to be done.
Jaheira,"Beyond that, our course is yours to set. I can recall how to take orders, as well as give them."
Jaheira,"We act with a purpose, Sarevok. Perhaps you have forgotten what that feels like."
Jaheira,"You have a Netherstone, and you're on the scent of two more."
Jaheira,"When we met, I was licking my wounds - an old bear with her leg caught in the hunter's snare."
Jaheira,Work to be done.<br>
Jaheira,"Hello, Death. I like your hat."
Jaheira,"Is it to be death, then? A better alternative to watching this sick family reunion."
Jaheira,You make promises that aren't yours to keep. Take care that their breaking does not break something more.
Jaheira,"Sarevok once fancied himself Bhaal's Chosen, until we put him in his place. Feel no shame for forgetting him - history shall do the same."
Jaheira,"Sarevok, Bhaal's least favourite son. Still tied to daddy's apron strings, I see."
Jaheira,"Is it true you were a member of the Absolute cult, drow?"
Jaheira,No. I mean to learn from you.
Jaheira,I travelled with a drow of Menzoberranzan once - Viconia DeVir. Do you know of her?
Jaheira,There is little love for her on the surface anymore.
Jaheira,"Now, I've slipped free of the trap and rediscovered my claws."
Jaheira,Not for me. They would die for peace.
Jaheira,"I've been thinking on all that you learned below. If you've caught your breath, we ought to discuss our next steps."
Jaheira,"I've been thinking on all that we learned below. If you've caught your breath, we ought to discuss our next steps."
Jaheira,"If you have business to conclude before we march, have it done."
Jaheira,The road to Baldur's Gate is long. 
Jaheira,And the city needs us.
Jaheira,"Our enemies spread like rub-rot - treat one patch, and two more bloom in its place."
Jaheira,"An elder brain, bound by lost Netherese magic, with servants of the Dead Three holding the chain."
Jaheira,Reminds me of old times.
Jaheira,Aren't you?
Jaheira,It is good to savour the moment of victory - but pace yourself. Our fight is just beginning.
Jaheira,"Does it hurt, Sarevok? To be confronted with yet another of your brood who is not so desperate for daddy's attention as you are?"
Jaheira,Remember. We are here to find our way into Bhaal's Temple. Not to enter his service in truth.
Jaheira,...So be it. At least let me be the one to strike the final blow.
Jaheira,"We have a lot to discuss but first, you have someone to thank."
Jaheira,"The Stone Lord. And swiftly, please - I can only hold my breath for so long."
Jaheira,The Counting House...? But what the hells could Minsc want there?
Jaheira,Now - you were speaking to my friend. Politely.
Jaheira,I've been to fouler fest-halls than this. And you have the stage presence of a Volothamp Geddarm.
Jaheira,"Now, now - he who keeps his manners keeps his teeth, too. Besides, you are only pretending to be as wine-soaked as your friend here."
Jaheira,"You mean that as a compliment, I am sure."
Jaheira,And you're sure you'll handle Minsc so easily as that?
Jaheira,"No threats, Astele. We are your allies, whether you want to see it or not."
Jaheira,"I won't tax your hospitality too long, Nine-Fingers. I'm searching for Minsc of Rashemen."
Jaheira,Lies.
Jaheira,Must you embarrass me in front of the city's lower life-forms?
Jaheira,"What treachery is this, Nine-Fingers? Have you thrown in with the Absolute, too?"
Jaheira,"We won't tax your hospitality too long, Nine-Fingers. I'm searching for Minsc of Rashemen."
Jaheira,I sense there is no love lost between the two of you.
Jaheira,"Is that what Nine-Fingers was doing, earlier? Wasting Guild time with this Stone Lord business?"
Jaheira,"The Knights of the Shield. How many days did I search in vain for their lair, only to cap the night with a drink above it?"
Jaheira,You should have stayed in your tower.
Jaheira,It's as good as done.
Jaheira,You'll make excellent fertiliser.
Jaheira,"Someday, I will sit down.<br>"
Jaheira,"Time for a social call, then. I'm sure Raphael makes for a wonderful host.<br>"
Jaheira,Oakfather ease the road.
Jaheira,"But we can settle debts later, Nine-Fingers. For now, we need help - we're searching for Minsc of Rashemen."
Jaheira,"Viconia DeVir. Alas, I know you a little too well to follow you into a dark hole in the ground."
Jaheira,You brought violence into my home. Know that I only leave you alive to fulfil your purpose against the Absolute - I make no promises for when all of this is done.
Jaheira,"Oh, by all means, help yourself. I'm sure there are some mouldering socks to be ransacked, too."
Jaheira,Good. That means you're back to your old ways.
Jaheira,You are being dramatic.
Jaheira,I have said my piece.
Jaheira,Now help my friend.
Jaheira,"Long after our bones are dust and ash, the walls of its prison will still be burning."
Jaheira,Tell it I will tear the Prism from your grasp and throw it in the deepest lava pit I can find.
Jaheira,"The mind flayer pours poison in your ear, I think."
Jaheira,"Think, you idiot! For once, just bloody THINK!"
Jaheira,He'll fight to the death if we let him - do not let it come to that!
Jaheira,"Finish the others, but spare Minsc - your Prism can still save him!"
Jaheira,The Prism! Swiftly!
Jaheira,"Minsc, stay with us. We have to hurry!"
Jaheira,Quickly - we do not know how long he has. Help him!
Jaheira,"He will not stay down for long - do something, before he is lost to us forever!"
Jaheira,"Fine. Come in, then - you might as well meet the family."
Jaheira,But if you do not trust me - take the weight from the pressure plate there. 
Jaheira,Pay no mind to the those. You're probably safe so long as I am here.
Jaheira,Hah! I wondered if it would take you long to spot.
Jaheira,This Harper pin opens more doors than most. Come down to my study and see if you can figure it out.
Jaheira,"A gift from my husband. I've had to renew parts, over the years - but the heart remains the same as the day he gave it to me."
Jaheira,"Have no fear, the traps aren't meant for you. But - better to stick close, eh?"
Jaheira,The only patch of wilderness this city permits me. There ought to be supplies here to aid us.
Jaheira,"I was a fool to trust you, and I paid the fool's price. But I will not pay it alone."
Jaheira,The Nightsong. Have you learned anything more?
Jaheira,"If I can warn the dukes an army of Absolutists is on the march, perhaps the city still stands a fighting chance."
Jaheira,"Honesty will serve you better than charity. I blundered into their trap, and it cost us."
Jaheira,You know me already. But you'll have the honour of making up for my blunder here.
Jaheira,The Archdruid Halsin. Do not be surprised that I know your name - you fit a rather singular description.
Jaheira,And one survivor of the shadow curse's fall ought to know another.
Jaheira,"Live with it, if you can - I will not."
Jaheira,Then you've made your choice. 
Jaheira,"No. We were a host hundreds strong, after all. Until we were not."
Jaheira,"No need for titles. You may call me Jaheira, so long as you are content to be known as Halsin. And the honour is mine."
Jaheira,Your stewardship of the Emerald Grove has made for something of a story among the circles.
Jaheira,"The apprentice who survived the shadow curse, and carried his masters home on his back. Who was raised their master in turn, and searches still for a way to save what was lost."
Jaheira,Huh. Once I would have never expected such words from a creature of the night. But you have saved the city.
Jaheira,"Not the battle, nor what came after."
Jaheira,You've chosen the company you keep - I will not allow the Bhaalspawn to hide behind you.
Jaheira,"Those of us who saw the birth of the shadow curse seem doomed to return, and bear witness to its work again."
Jaheira,"But I ought to warn you, Halsin. Much as it shames me - it is not the curse I come to cleanse, but the cult."
Jaheira,And I hope that we shall have that chance. But not at the expense of the world entire.
Jaheira,"Goodbye, Bhaalspawn. Harpers, to arms. Let's defend this city as we always have."
Jaheira,What about you? Will you protect the world from what they have become?
Jaheira,"Then I'll pray for the Oakfather to raise the road before you, but my battle is with the Absolute."
Jaheira,What about you? Will you protect the world from what she has become?
Jaheira,What about you? Will you protect the world from what he has become?
Jaheira,"I know better. I stood here a century ago, and watched this same ceremony unfold. I stand here again to show you how it ends:"
Jaheira,"Minsc and I, we know better. We stood here a century ago, and watched this same ceremony unfold. We stand here again to show you how it ends:"
Jaheira,"You have won Bhaal's bloody blessing. Now you think you will step out into the world, and carve your name upon it."
Jaheira,"This path was not of our choosing, Minsc. But we must walk it all the same."
Jaheira,"No more threats? I admit, I was hoping for - "
Jaheira,"Harpers, to me! We have a True Soul to crush."
Jaheira,Harpers - let us do what we must.
Jaheira,"I assure you, it's quite safe."
Jaheira,"I will gladly drink to your health as well, Karlach."
Jaheira,"This place is crawling with Harpers. If Marcus managed to get himself infected, we would've known the same minute."
Jaheira,But you're far from the most eccentric drinking companion I've had. I'd like to know more. Cheers.
Jaheira,It means you've found an old woman down to her last idea - drinking with a mind flayer's infectee.
Jaheira,"A genuine pleasure to meet you again, my friend."
Jaheira,Please - drink. You'll tolerate what I have to say better after a glass or two.
Jaheira,You utter bastard.
Jaheira,"Well spotted, but if I wanted you dead, I'd have crushed you with my vines. "
Jaheira,I've only added a touch of Klauthgrass - a quaint herb that encourages truth-telling.
Jaheira,"Haven't you noticed how close an eye he keeps on Isobel? Think about it: no Isobel, no Last Light."
Jaheira,The shadows haven't consumed you. Good.
Jaheira,"Look for torch fire in the distance, but do not venture out. Wave the patrol over to safety."
Jaheira,"They'll be back, don't you worry. Lighter than the dark, faster than the shadows - that is how they move."
Jaheira,"They're taking their sweet time, aren't they, Harpers? Must be some good picnic spots out there."
Jaheira,Don't wander far - we need to talk.
Jaheira,"Serene she might seem, but nature has fangs!"
Jaheira,For the fallen!
Jaheira,You are scarcely fit to feed the earth.
Jaheira,Just Marcus. At least that's what our new friend tells me.
Jaheira,"Cultists, fiends, and now a traitor in our midst. Some things never change."
Jaheira,Listen. Marcus is a traitor. He's with the Absolute. We have to be ready to move in before he can stage an attack.
Jaheira,"If you see movement, don't be too quick to shoot. Friend and foe look alike in the deep shadows."
Jaheira,You don't know what you're missing.
Jaheira,Then I am afraid you don't know us at all - as we never truly knew you.
Jaheira,Don't I? We both left this land with a half-victory in hand at most - but only one of us settled for it.
Jaheira,It's happening. They'll all be taken by the shadows. 
Jaheira,"For a little while longer, you and I are destined to fight side by side, but if the shades don't take you, I have the next claim on your head."
Jaheira,We cannot hesitate. Not even for those we knew - those we cared for. They're no longer who they were.
Jaheira,Steel your hearts and steady your hands. To battle!
Jaheira,"Listen closely, for there's very little time. Even if Last Light falls, your mission does not change: you must find Ketheric Thorm and you must kill him."
Jaheira,Liar. Filthy liar.
Jaheira,"I gave you my trust too easily, but with the same ease I swear I'll strike you down."
Jaheira,Harpers! We must cleanse...
Jaheira,You're right. There's no stopping it now.
Jaheira,"In this moment, you are the greater threat."
Jaheira,It's happening. They'll all be taken by the shadows. Only by the grace of Isobel's spell will we be spared the same fate.
Jaheira,Blackguard! You're viler than the worm that's consuming you.
Jaheira,I see little more than a cowardly deception at play.
Jaheira,Isobel! No! What in the Nine Hells happened?
Jaheira,"I don't see how she... Unless some cultist sneaked in, but gods, we'll be overrun!"
Jaheira,Liar! It was you who killed her.
Jaheira,A little spat.
Jaheira,"Do you understand what you've done? Without Isobel, everyone in this inn is as good as dead!"
Jaheira,"I trusted you. Silvanus forgive me, I let you in."
Jaheira,"It's all over. They're all gone. My brave ones, my friends, my Harpers."
Jaheira,I led them here - to this.
Jaheira,But you live. A single green leaf holding fast on a tree ravaged by winter.
Jaheira,Gods spare us. Ketheric was planning our demise all along.
Jaheira,"Who is this performance for, Bhaalspawn? It is only us here - you need not pretend."
Jaheira,Until then: to battle!
Jaheira,But hark! Something stirs...
Jaheira,And you could have embraced death with a smile. Few are given such a choice.
Jaheira,"You have what you wanted, Chosen. And now you will see exactly what that means."
Jaheira,"It has become my way, perhaps, to always have one eye on the next fight. For better or worse, that is the cult."
Jaheira,"Though I will not be the one to fight it, I think. The one you journey with - we ought to speak."
Jaheira,"Though I will not be the one to fight it, I think. The one you journey with - we have already spoken of infiltrating Moonrise."
Jaheira,"Without you, there would be no Absolute. This was all your doing."
Jaheira,"Congratulating you, of course."
Jaheira,Archdruid. May the Oakfather raise the road before you.
Jaheira,"Bear with me for a moment, there are better places to talk."
Jaheira,Drop that stone. You will want your hands free for what comes next.
Jaheira,So it begins. So it will end. 
Jaheira,I'm spreading word - quietly. Go and flush Marcus out. My Harpers and I will make sure he has nowhere to go.
Jaheira,"Stand together! Protect one another! Arm in arm, the oaks outlast the storm!"
Jaheira,Strike like lightning! Roar like thunder! Wash over them with a blizzard's fury!
Jaheira,"You wretch! To think you had my trust. If this be my last act, let it be in service of strangling the life out of you."
Jaheira,"And you had no idea? After Marcus vouched for you at the gate, he didn't confide in you?"
Jaheira,You don't get to decide. Not here. Not while I'm responsible for the lives of the people at this inn.
Jaheira,I suppose I have no choice but to believe you.
Jaheira,Isobel is gone. Soon the shadows will wash us all away.
Jaheira,"Listen closely, for there's very little time. Even if Last Light falls, you must destroy the cult of the Absolute."
Jaheira,"Their leader is a man called Ketheric Thorm. He resides in Moonrise Towers, and we've found him to be impervious to the blade, and to magic to boot."
Jaheira,"As impossible as that task sounds, there must be a way to break the spell that makes him invincible. There are secrets in this ancient waste, hidden from..."
Jaheira,Hold the line at all costs - be the cliff that breaks the sea!
Jaheira,Bottoms up.
Jaheira,"Well, consider this an experiment, then. "
Jaheira,"You will be refreshed, and I will be reassured. "
Jaheira,Be ready. I suspect Raphael will throws a tantrum when the other children touch his toys.
Jaheira,And now we are the best of friends. You see? The power of trust.
Jaheira,"Look around you. You shall have to learn to live with 'not good enough', I'm afraid."
Jaheira,"A search burdened by unnatural darkness, but don't let that discourage you."
Jaheira,"You were the last to be alone with her. And just like that, she's gone."
Jaheira,If you had nothing to do with it - and I want to believe you didn't - you have nothing to fear from me.
Jaheira,"Please, be welcome. Have a drink."
Jaheira,To your very good health.
Jaheira,"It doesn't spoil the taste, if that's what you're wondering."
Jaheira,My pleasure. Now - drink.
Jaheira,"Now. You've shown me how well you can sniff out secrets. It's time you turned that nose upon Ketheric, no?"
Jaheira,Well over a century old and yet it hasn't lost a hint of flavour.
Jaheira,People tend to lose more than just flavour when illithids get their hands on them. I speak from experience.
Jaheira,There's an air about you. Something - alien.
Jaheira,"Answer me true and do not lie: the parasite is changing you, isn't it?"
Jaheira,Just answer the question.
Jaheira,And you're certain you will continue to resist?
Jaheira,"Good. I will take your word for it. And hold you to it, too."
Jaheira,"Look around you: good men, good women, stranded here - two feet in the grave."
Jaheira,"If we're to survive, I have no choice but to trust you. Can I?"
Jaheira,"Well, let us hope you cannot catch anything this way."
Jaheira,"You seem like a good kid. But I'm going to hold you to that - with my scimitar, if needed."
Jaheira,"Still not quite so sure about you, though."
Jaheira,Good. Because I'll cross your heart myself if you break it.
Jaheira,"She'll extend that protection to you too, if you see her. You've shown me how well you can sniff out secrets - I'd like to see you turn that nose upon Ketheric Thorm."
Jaheira,If it will help. Only remember:
Jaheira,Isobel's in her room upstairs - she'll be expecting you.
Jaheira,Is this meant to be some kind of joke?
Jaheira,"Let's be discreet about this. If Marcus is what you say, there's no telling what kind of reinforcements he might be able to summon."
Jaheira,All right. He's in Isobel's room upstairs. Play along with his ruse for now while I gather a few trusted Harpers - but don't let him get his hands on Isobel!
Jaheira,You did well bringing this to me - thank you.
Jaheira,"A Harper's gaze can only be turned by proof. By the looks of it, a tall tale is all you have to offer."
Jaheira,"You might be... eccentric, but you're still our best hope of finishing off Ketheric Thorm."
Jaheira,I hope I'm not mistaken.
Jaheira,"You're quite serious, aren't you?"
Jaheira,I'm not ignoring you - I just see no evidence of your rather outlandish claim. 
Jaheira,I bear more blame for the shadow curse than Isobel does. And she can no more control her parentage than you can that thing in your head.
Jaheira,You've come from the shadows and wasted no time accusing one of our companions of treason. It's all a little... odd.
Jaheira,You've got a Thorm to undo.
Jaheira,"Do you. Well, let us not leave you in suspense, then."
Jaheira,You are right. She is.
Jaheira,"Because it isn't my tale to tell. And because, in truth, I do not know the half of it. Only this:"
Jaheira,Bah. Every tinkerer thinks his toy is indestructible - until you hit it hard enough.
Jaheira,"Something malign? Or some blessing of Selûne, perhaps? I do not know what restored Isobel's life to her. But I can see what she is doing with it."
Jaheira,"Exactly the point, wouldn't you say? "
Jaheira,"If she wished to see us drowned in darkness, Isobel needn't have lifted a finger. Instead, she holds out her hand."
Jaheira,"Perhaps she chooses to do, rather than say."
Jaheira,"When I find myself needing a reminder of just who Isobel Thorm is, I simply step outside and look up."
Jaheira,"There is a grave threat to us all, stretching as far as Baldur's Gate, and I need your help."
Jaheira,"I have every reason to be cautious. I've traced people like you, people with parasites in their brains, all the way here from Baldur's Gate."
Jaheira,"The cult of the Absolute is spreading through the city - quietly, quickly, and with unsettling deliberation."
Jaheira,We tracked them to this ancient village only to be faced with a man we killed and buried over a century ago.
Jaheira,I'm sure it's very fine. But lanterns have a tricky habit of going out when you need them.<br><br>
Jaheira,"Let's not spurn what few gifts the gods choose to give us, hm?"
Jaheira,"When I asked your aid, I did not think you the type to balance our lives on petty intrigue."
Jaheira,"But... so be it. It is you who has the key to Moonrise, not I. Do what you must - if it rids us of this cult, we'll consider the price well-paid."
Jaheira,"Justify it whatever way you wish. The fact remains that I placed our lives in your hands, and you tossed them down as a wager in some game of your own."
Jaheira,"I had hoped undoing his protection might loosen the shadows' grip on this land, too - give us some means to move against him in force.<br>"
Jaheira,"Such a sharp tongue. Perhaps I'll stuff it in your ear, so you might enjoy your own wit in death."
Jaheira,I was a fool to trust you. For the last time. Harpers! There's a traitor among us.
Jaheira,"Without a cure to your infection, that lifetime might become rather limited. "
Jaheira,Believe me - he was well and truly dead. I locked his corpse in the Thorm mausoleum myself.
Jaheira,She's upstairs in her chambers. Tell her I sent you and she'll see you through the shadows safely.
Jaheira,General Ketheric Thorm. Remember that name. He's the leader of the Absolutists.
Jaheira,"He was a Sharran, once - took to building an army of Dark Justiciars beneath this very village. Alongside the local druids, we made it our business to see him deposed - dead and buried."
Jaheira,"That was a public display of hope, despite private reservations."
Jaheira,"I've traced people like you, people with parasites in their brains, all the way here from Baldur's Gate."
Jaheira,It's the wine. I added a herb to your cup that betrays your lie.
Jaheira,I find that decidedly hard to believe.
Jaheira,But a river can flood and break its banks. If the parasite changes you - tries to break you - could you resist?
Jaheira,Indulge me.
Jaheira,A paralysing agent? I do not think we're quite so far gone - yet.
Jaheira,A noble proclamation. It must have you made you quite thirsty.
Jaheira,"You know more of the herb than I do, it seems. Except for how it tastes, perhaps?"
Jaheira,It seems likely. Which means he isn't working alone.
Jaheira,She cast the moon shield around the inn. It's the only reason we're still alive.
Jaheira,"Isobel - a faithful cleric of Selûne, and a light in the darkness."
Jaheira,You're not our only secret weapon.
Jaheira,You were the one who rescued those the Absolute had imprisoned. You were courageous to brave the depths of Ketheric's stronghold.
Jaheira,"I suppose you know about Ketheric, then. His invincibility. That we'll never cleanse this place until he's made to bleed."
Jaheira,You've been to the Towers? Incredible. Your parasite has already served you well.
Jaheira,"The one and only. He was a Sharran, then. We caught him building an army of Dark Justiciars. With the local druids, we made a powerful alliance and put him down."
Jaheira,"But he's returned. Not only does General Ketheric Thorm live again, it seems he is no longer mortal. He has become, in fact, invincible."
Jaheira,"We met him on the road here - commanding an army of the Absolute, intent on destroying Baldur's Gate. I put an arrow through his eye myself, only to watch him pluck it out like a splinter."
Jaheira,"He healed right in front of me, and chased us into the shadows. Things looked hopeless, but experience has taught me that no matter how bleak things look, there's always hope."
Jaheira,You are that hope.
Jaheira,Not immediately.
Jaheira,"The light is rather dim, out here in the shadowlands. The point remains:"
Jaheira,"The same way he dealt with my arrow in his eye, I suspect. Much as I share your desire for a simple life - we must try another way."
Jaheira,"And the wit to know when it will not avail you, I think. We must try another way."
Jaheira,"Protected by your artefact, you can infiltrate his forces at Moonrise Towers, posing as a True Soul."
Jaheira,Find out what it is that makes him invincible so we can strip him of his advantage.
Jaheira,I appreciate your enthusiasm. Just be sure it doesn't make you leap before you look.
Jaheira,"Infiltrate the Towers, and Ketheric's downfall begins. What's more - you'll find the cure for that thing in your head."
Jaheira,"Without a cure for your infection, your days are numbered too, yet you selflessly offer to spend them fighting alongside us. I like you."
Jaheira,I promise I will do everything I can to make sure you survive this.
Jaheira,"Besides, you need this. You need to heal yourself of your infection."
Jaheira,Any cure starts with understanding the disease. 
Jaheira,"Whatever magic Ketheric's using to control these tadpoles, it must be at Moonrise."
Jaheira,"Until then, we'll keep drinking wine when we meet."
Jaheira,"Before you go, there's somebody else you should meet."
Jaheira,"Agreed. We must end the threat at Moonrise altogether. With your help, we stand every chance of doing just that."
Jaheira,Only a respite. Do not forget who knows the Bhaalspawn better than any alive. Your path only ever led one way.
Jaheira,What must be done.
Jaheira,"The druid in me would like to say it was a thing of balance. The younger woman recalls rather more about a fine bottom, and the habit not to speak unless he had something to say."
Jaheira,"The Dead Three plague the world still. The city still falls prey to small minds like Gortash, or lost souls like Orin."
Jaheira,"It is every Harper's hope to be a light that drives out darkness. But I've lived long enough to see so many of those lights burn out, while the shadows cling stubbornly on."
Jaheira,Knowing that - isn't it our duty to burn on if we can? To fight for as long as we are able?
Jaheira,"Or pleasing their own Undying Queen - who lives on to serve... what purpose, exactly?"
Jaheira,"And use it to do more than fight, I'd hope. Shar and Selûne have already claimed more than their share of your years, I think."
Jaheira,"Perhaps. But if the darkness is really going to swallow everything, as you Sharrans say, it should at least have to work for its supper."
Jaheira,"I'd have thought time would dull either, but I suppose I should know better than to argue with an immortal.<br>"
Jaheira,And if it does? That does not mean you cannot dig your heels in a little.
Jaheira,"Or proof that you plan to fight on, rather than take the easier path."
Jaheira,"You've done more than your share of fighting already, Karlach. If there is one person I would trust to make the most of a longer life, it is you."
Jaheira,"I do not speaking of clinging to life for its own sake. I just... look back on that life's work, and I wonder - is it done?"
Jaheira,You see? I should know better than to philosophize in the company of an archdruid.
Jaheira,"Here I stand on only the humble three, half-cousin. But I hope I've filled them with my fair share of living."
Jaheira,"If the bards are right, then I've already done my share of deeds. But I can assure you, the work only ever feels half-finished at best."
Jaheira,"In truth, I had put this ritual from my mind - until Last Light. Trapped in that darkness, I turned to my research again: what if I was a little stronger? As fast as I once had been?"
Jaheira,"Then you came, and made the question moot. But I kept this - just in case, I told myself. A final resort."
Jaheira,"I believe that still. But, when I look on all we have achieved since, I wonder... perhaps it is not heroes we need. Only people who are willing to try."
Jaheira,"So I will accept mine, when and however it comes. As for the this city's story, well..."
Jaheira,"I worried that perhaps you were not the saviour you seemed. That Minsc was gone forever, and my family was doomed to see the city they love fall."
Jaheira,"Only, now - when I look at this, and think of all we have done, I realise: I was not worried. Not even afraid. I was arrogant."
Jaheira,Death is a piss-poor excuse not to live. Who do you think I learned that from?
Jaheira,Hah! Do not thank me for slinging a weight around your neck. I might start to feel bad.
Jaheira,"Of course I will, berserker. And you will sprout soft and golden locks from that shining skull."
Jaheira,Do not look at me like that. I have been content to see the span of my natural years - a privilege far too few in this world can claim.
Jaheira,I make no plans. Only... contingencies.
Jaheira,"In greener days, I might have been strong enough to do it. I might be yet, with the right preparations."
Jaheira,Perhaps I should applaud the liberation of bound creatures. But somehow I sense I will be the one cleaning up this mess.
Jaheira,"Come, let's be free of this foul place. There is little else to be done."
Jaheira,"Well? Are you composing a poem in your head, or some such?"
Jaheira,Good.
Jaheira,"Chasing rumour halfway around the city and back. Crossing the Guild, wading through filth, defying the one creature upon whom your very life depends."
Jaheira,All for a madman and his rodent.
Jaheira,"I've done my share of praying to her, though not for the cause of peace. My faith was suddenly found on choppy seas."
Jaheira,All... for this.
Jaheira,"While I wish Minsc had seen reason at the Guildhall, even so..."
Jaheira,All the more cracks and crevices for a wild-shape to ferret into - gum up the works a little. 
Jaheira,"You reasons were your own but, whether you meant for it or not, your fight is our fight. Both of us, to the very end."
Jaheira,"Bringing those two together might have been your greatest service to the city, or your worst. Time will tell."
Jaheira,"Oh spare me the sad eyes, girl!  Not every daily deed is worthy of song! Certainly none I can play."
Jaheira,"Eh. Mostly the same children's rhyme, on a battered whistle of tin. I do not get a lot of time to practise."
Jaheira,"As in... hobbies? Oh. Well... I like to play music, I suppose?"
Jaheira,For the moment he - and I - are your problem. So lead the way - we are yours to command.
Jaheira,"Ah, those misty eyes are just age. I feel myself growing older as we stand here. So:"
Jaheira,He is an ass. I can make no promises beyond that. But even so:
Jaheira,I think you will find that Boo is the added bonus - Minsc is just here to carry him into battle. But you are right to focus on the fight.
Jaheira,"Yes, it was. If you need confirmation of my gratitude, only look - here I stand, awaiting orders. So:"
Jaheira,Lead the way. We're yours to command.
Jaheira,The threat of spanking never kept the children from poking through my things. Why should it deter you?
Jaheira,"If they be learned, and powerful enough, the practitioner of this ritual might slow their ageing. Extend their life well beyond its natural reach."
Jaheira,"I do mean what I say - but I am also a Harper. In every honeyed word, there is a hook."
Jaheira,"I have no plans to lie down and die. Well - perhaps a little lying down, when all of this is done."
Jaheira,And age better too. She who is most weathered is also most wise.
Jaheira,Do not be so sure. I was not always so soft and agreeable as I have become.
Jaheira,I cannot think what it is we have to talk about.
Jaheira,So humbly spoken. Perhaps you are a different breed than the last Mother Superior.
Jaheira,"Tell me, Shadowheart - how does Shar's favour feel? Does it fill you up, bring you joy?"
Jaheira,"Shadowheart's choices are her own, but I bear no small blame. Viconia should have been rooted from the city years ago. First the Absolute - then, a reckoning."
Jaheira,"Only that I find it hard to believe that she could have raised you, and felt nothing for you."
Jaheira,Shadowheart. You should know - Viconia was not half so heartless as she liked to appear.
Jaheira,Let us find Aylin and extend Lorroakan's invitation? It has been too long since I have seen a wizard cry.
Jaheira,"The Grand Duke to be. I'd follow you into battle, Wyll - but politics? I think I am perhaps too faint of heart."
Jaheira,Nothing like a little panic to sell papers. I know I've bought enough of them in my time.
Jaheira,"Not at all - Harpers fight dirty. A well-timed strike, with the knowledge of just where to place it, and suddenly superior numbers count for nothing."
Jaheira,And now another 'final' battle. This small band has gone further than any army could have in its place.
Jaheira,Play whatever part you must to get us closer to Orin's stone. It is not for me to question.
Jaheira,"I had no wish to lose you, Wyll, but - my, it would have been nice to flush her into the colony's flesh-pit."
Jaheira,"I had no wish to lose Wyll, but - my, it would have been nice to flush her into the colony's flesh-pit."
Jaheira,"If Nine-Fingers survived the fray, she will be right back to work in there. We ought to speak to her."
Jaheira,'The Blade of Frontiers'. May the tortured rhymes recounting your deeds continue.
Jaheira,Lae'zel. My brief time on the Astral Plane left quite the impression. You must miss it dearly.
Jaheira,I am still primed to hear some slimy final rhyme from beyond the grave.
Jaheira,Some twisting of the tadpole to have me turn my blades against my own? No more - you are no better than these cultists.
Jaheira,"A sweeter sight still, the world those ships might make if you plied them between the planes. Interplanar learning, trade..."
Jaheira,"Ugh. I have no love for the sea, but the city would not be what it is without these ships. That lends them a kind of beauty, I suppose."
Jaheira,Careful who it is you turn your ire on. I will not stand by while you attack allies.
Jaheira,"I am not in the habit of giving second warnings. We still have a common enemy in the Absolute - but here our paths diverge. May you find good fortune - and some sense, too."
Jaheira,If you wish. It's possible I was a little too quick to judge. A little too caught up in ceremony.
Jaheira,"She spoke to you in a rather... familiar fashion. More shapeshifter mind-games, I suppose."
Jaheira,"It is not something you need concern yourself with. I've picked up stranger things in all my travels, trust me."
Jaheira,"Wyrm's Crossing. This place has been a haven, when Harpers were less than welcome in the city proper."
Jaheira,"And death might find us any moment. If I cannot meet it with a bit of cheerful futility, why bother being a Harper at all?"
Jaheira,"Something kept me from throwing it away. A fear, perhaps, that you were not the saviour you seemed to be."
Jaheira,"Did you think it would escape my notice forever? What you did to Isobel, in exchange for a little of your father's power?"
Jaheira,I share my blame for pushing you down that path - for telling you that we must finish Ketheric at all costs.
Jaheira,"And I am not blind. We have all profited from the results - perhaps the entire world will, before all of this is done. "
Jaheira,"But I have to believe that there is a better way.  So I will hold on to this for a little while, I think - and see which one of us is right."
Jaheira,"Did you think it would escape my notice forever? That you would trade Isobel away, to bring us closer to our goal?"
Jaheira,"You have cleared every obstacle in your path. Done everything that could be asked of you, without fear or favour. And without any regard for the cost."
Jaheira,"So I will hold onto this a little longer, I think, and linger on - to see which one of us is right."
Jaheira,"Perhaps not. But know that I judge myself every bit as harshly, for allowing this to come to pass."
Jaheira,I hope that you will.
Jaheira,You're right. We have probably wasted enough words on this matter.
Jaheira,Now come - our work isn't done yet.
Jaheira,"I know you would. But once the city squeezed it from you, what would be left? Everyone who seizes at eternal life has some purpose, in the beginning."
Jaheira,"I do not doubt you would serve her forever - only that she would let you. Strangely enough, those who grasp eternal life rarely mean for others to share in it."
Jaheira,"A noble sentiment. But I wonder if it would not lose some of its lustre, over the long years."
Jaheira,"I spent most of my life fighting those who tried to escape their end. Ketheric, Irenicus, Sarevok... that is not company I would like to keep."
Jaheira,My feelings exactly.
Jaheira,"So long as you serve a proper meal at the wedding. None of this finger-picking nonsense, yes?"
Jaheira,"Not at all. The world does not wait around for us, so take your moment while you may. Damn what anyone else thinks."
Jaheira,"So, Wyll - you have your mind set on marriage."
Jaheira,Well-answered.
Jaheira,"Oh, a Harper does not go in for public acclaim. We work in shadow and secrecy, tragically unacknowledged by the ungrateful herd."
Jaheira,And to fight it is to doom yourself to defeat.
Jaheira,"Bah, where is the barbarian rage? I have been learning so many colourful phrases from you, I was hoping to inspire a few more."
Jaheira,She's circling - have no doubt of that.
Jaheira,"But Orin is more predator than politician, I think. She simply wants to make us feel hunted - isolated."
Jaheira,"What need, when it seems so intent on repeating itself?"
Jaheira,But stay this apocalypse and I'll let you read my journals. Promise.
Jaheira,"More than I would like. In my youth, I was a brief - and very much unwilling - member of a colony's hivemind. "
Jaheira,"I felt the way they think. Saw the world as they do. Foul, unnatural creatures, who find the foulness in us and twist it to their will."
Jaheira,But then - who am I speaking to? You have far more experience than I.
Jaheira,"Do not be moved to pity. It is a predator, pinned in a trap."
Jaheira,"And if it wriggles free, you'll find it still has teeth."
Jaheira,"I believe you. You remind me of another I knew, marked by forces beyond their control."
Jaheira,"The gods can grant power or strip it away - but so long as your will remains, you have the only weapon you need."
Jaheira,"I did. Though I don't often speak of it - so many seem to think they know the whole story already, I find it a pity to correct them."
Jaheira,Which is to say - yes. I am that old.
Jaheira,"We can speak of old battles later - our plate is piled high with catastrophes enough for the present, hm?"
Jaheira,There you are.
Jaheira,"A cold kind of mercy. But mercy still, I think, Astarion."
Jaheira,"And what of the living they'll feast on, should they not prove as admirable as Astarion? They deserve a chance, too."
Jaheira,Are we truly to be party to this?
Jaheira,"My eyes are sharp enough to see you squirm, vampire lord. They can guide Astarion, too."
Jaheira,"Enough now, Astarion. There is only one life that needs taking here, and you have it in your grasp."
Jaheira,"Well, Lord Vampire? Was it everything you hoped?"
Jaheira,You've already bested your father. I would advise against fighting the battle over again in your mind.
Jaheira,But if you have questions - you've earned whatever answers I can give.
Jaheira,"Bhaal had his minions, certainly. But none that watched over their wards so diligently."
Jaheira,"She stands at the same crossroads you yourself once did, Viconia - but it seems you are not quite the teacher you thought."
Jaheira,I've passed enough years that counting them is a waste of what remains.
Jaheira,Oh. Good. Then I am under no obligation to be wise.
Jaheira,"Don't tell me which. Against all life experience, I will choose to assume the best."
Jaheira,"...Ah. You've wandered far in my absence. And now you come to march me to the gallows, is it?"
Jaheira,"Cazador would have used his power to prey on the city. If you say you will be its protector, instead - I plan to hold you to that standard."
Jaheira,"You think me lonely? In truth, I prefer travel in a small pack such as this."
Jaheira,With allies every bit as peculiar - give or take a few tadpoles.
Jaheira,"Would you? In time, then. Perhaps once you've found a rocking chair for me to doze off in."
Jaheira,"Hah! A kind way of saying: 'Ye gods, I hope her dusty bones don't break at the first blow.'"
Jaheira,Fear not for me. I will try my very best to keep up.
Jaheira,Then ask.
Jaheira,"I have given you much reason to think that Harpers hoard secrets like precious stones. But I promise you, this was not some intrigue."
Jaheira,"Just... plain and simple foolishness. As if by keeping clear of my family, I might keep them clear of the cult in turn."
Jaheira,"And if this fight were to go against us, well... they had already done their mourning. Why visit it on them twice?"
Jaheira,"Careful, now. Only I get to say it. And my daughter, apparently. "
Jaheira,"Well, if fool I be, then at least I'm in good company."
Jaheira,"Of course I was! You met her, did you not? The girl had opinions before she had teeth."
Jaheira,"No. Quite the opposite, in fact. I hoped to greet my family when all the fighting was done."
Jaheira,I was wrong to think I could keep my children from this fight. They're Baldurian born and bred - the only damned reason I root myself in this place.
Jaheira,"This city is a cesspit. An open sewer of the soul, that taints us with its filth, and churns us out when all that is good has been stripped away."
Jaheira,It also happens to be their home - and so it is mine. Ugh... that might be the first time I have said that out loud.
Jaheira,"Now come - we had best get to saving it, lest Rion turn her ire on us both."
Jaheira,"If you have questions, ask. Just don't expect my answers to rhyme."
Jaheira,"It was Bhaal alone we faced in our time - and bad as that was, he had no elder brain for a lapdog then."
Jaheira,"Help won't come from the history books, or from any old tales I can spin you. This is your story to write."
Jaheira,There: have I fulfilled my role as your wise and wizened elder?
Jaheira,I wonder if past experience has taught the great god to fear - that another of his children might turn against him.
Jaheira,"Yes. Your rancid father will try to twist your thoughts, as he did with all his children."
Jaheira,"The harder you resist, the darker your dreams become. Our camp was often roused by screams in the night, back then."
Jaheira,We learned to take them as a marker of pride. Even gods can be resisted.
Jaheira,"We try to work towards a common balance. If every other faction finds us equally annoying, that is probably a sign that we are succeeding."
Jaheira,"You speak of a battle more than a century past. Bhaal's minions led us through a maze in the Undercity, older than Baldur's Gate itself."
Jaheira,"Still - the Undercity shifts. We might search down there - or better yet, find a Bhaalist to lead us."
Jaheira,"Then clean out your ears, and listen again."
Jaheira,"Oh, I'm sure time and an ageing mind have smoothed out a few of his flaws. But he was a good man."
Jaheira,"The songs make much of Khalid's meekness. The quiet little Harper who had to keep a tight hold on his courage. But he had it when it counted. And, more than that:"
Jaheira,But a bard can tell you all the rest. As for all the things they cannot... well. I shall just have to keep those for myself.
Jaheira,Most Harpers swagger and flash their feathers to catch your attention. Khalid was of a quieter sort. 
Jaheira,I have never known a warrior who would go so far out of his way to avoid a fight. Which meant the few he chose were usually the right ones.
Jaheira,"Nothing that wasn't already there, fear not. But I've lived many lifetimes since Khalid died."
Jaheira,"You twine your life around the people you love. And when they are gone, you grow around their absence instead. It is just another way they shape you."
Jaheira,Which is my sage way of saying - I am in no danger of forgetting how my husband died. But I choose to remember how he lived.
Jaheira,Oh dear - should I brace myself for some fashion advice?
Jaheira,"But, I suppose you have earned better than glibness from me. It was a gift from my husband. Khalid."
Jaheira,"He was a Harper. A better one than me, truth be told - any idiot can swing a sword. But to believe in the cause, with the whole of your heart? A much trickier thing."
Jaheira,"He died. Alone, in pain, and far too young - murdered by a mage who craved immortality. I'll not grant it by naming him in the same breath as my husband."
Jaheira,I think we have enough to be getting on with without the small talk - don't you?
Jaheira,So Bhaal's Chosen is a doppelganger. I should not be surprised - they have ever been among his favourite servants.
Jaheira,"Orin is testing you. Either she thinks herself a predator, playing with her food... or she fears what you might do."
Jaheira,"She spoke to you in a rather... familiar fashion. Perhaps she considers you family, given your heritage."
Jaheira,Exactly.
Jaheira,Aye. This all begins to ring a little too familiar for my liking. 
Jaheira,"The last time I fought doppelgangers, the Bhaalspawn Sarevok was using them to subvert the city government. Aid his rise to power."
Jaheira,"Some call the Harpers heroes. Others, petty meddlers who cannot help but stick their nose into every conflict they stumble across. The truth is in there somewhere."
Jaheira,"If we squint with suspicion at every face we see, she will already have landed her blow."
Jaheira,Hmm. I've learned not to unpick the legends so many have woven around our name. Seeing the hope die in a romantic's eyes - it is only funny the first few dozen times.
Jaheira,"If I tried to spare Geraldus the same headaches, well - now you know why. And if he is half the Harper I suspect, it won't make a damned bit of difference."
Jaheira,"If you are asking whether love and joy are beyond you, just because of the taint in your blood..."
Jaheira,No. They most certainly are not.
Jaheira,"I am no expert on the matter, despite all my experience. But - if anything I know can help you to resist your father... only ask it."
Jaheira,"He craved power, and his bloodline was just another path to achieve it. I saw that same bloodline turned to better ends than Bhaal ever intended for it."
Jaheira,"It was Bhaalspawn who threatened the Coast, and Bhaalspawn who saved it. It is possible to go on a live a life outside your father's shadow."
Jaheira,Ha! Bhaal was but the beginning. Be warned - a godspawn draws trouble like iron to lodestone.
Jaheira,"There will be crusaders who wish to rid the world of your taint, or jealous minds who believe themselves more deserving of the power in your blood."
Jaheira,I'm sure Gale has heard the cautionary tale of the mad mage Jon Irenicus.
Jaheira,But happiness is not beyond a Bhaalspawn. It simply comes at a higher cost - constant vigilance.
Jaheira,Then you are wise.
Jaheira,"I will not mince words: if what you told me is true, you are already further under Bhaal's power than my old friend ever was."
Jaheira,"But so long as you fear that power, there is hope. Fear means you are not fully mad - not yet."
Jaheira,"Mm? No, not really."
Jaheira,"In all my years fighting for the Harpers, I am still never certain what 'the greater good' means. I've learned to be content with: 'well, that was not so bad as it might have been'."
Jaheira,"I will not bore you with a long tale. The short: I was born to a high family in Tethyr. I remember little, except that when my family fell, they fell far. And fast."
Jaheira,"I learned young what fear and hunger make desperate people do. I learned to do some of it myself, even, until a roving circle of hedge-druids found me."
Jaheira,"They showed me how to fight with sword as well as spell, and gave me ample causes to wield them for. If I was not always the truest believer in every cause, well..."
Jaheira,I fell in love with someone who was. And that is almost the same thing.
Jaheira,"Oh, you might say that. I left their service and swore never to return. Multiple times, if I recall."
Jaheira,It is easy to get tired of the intrigue. The high causes shrouded in secrecy. I thought I might find another way to be of use to the world.
Jaheira,"And for a time, I did. But my comrades would use a rather irritating phrase: 'A Harper never leaves the chorus - she simply goes to spread the song.'"
Jaheira,"Meaning that whatever cause I turned my hand to, there I would find them. Harpers, stuffed with their own virtue - but always there. Always trying to help."
Jaheira,"If I wanted to spare Geraldus the same headaches, well... you know now why I needed him to be sure this is the life he wants."
Jaheira,"But you're staring - which means the tadpole has finally eaten your brain, or I have been talking too much. Either way, time to move - no?"
Jaheira,"You've a love-struck look about you, Karlach. Just do not let it distract you from the task ahead."
Jaheira,Would you like to keep those hands to yourself? We have few enough allies - do not harm them.
Jaheira,"What was this - some trick of the tadpole, to make me attack my own? I won't stay here to be your plaything."
Jaheira,"I try not to play at politics, especially those of another plane. Your prince's battle is his own."
Jaheira,I was not always a Harper. I only returned to their fold once I knew it was my own cause I fought for - not whichever one they assigned to me.
Jaheira,You've learned to choose your own course. Enjoy that dizzying sense of freedom - after comes twice the headaches.
Jaheira,As I said - it is no small thing. 
Jaheira,"Lae'zel has courage, turning her back on a lifetime's belief. As for us - best we stay out of interplanar politics, I think. Orpheus is on his own."
Jaheira,"This ritual your spawn-kin spoke of - it seems your master has prepared a homecoming for you, Astarion."
Jaheira,"You are a better man than most, to choose what is right even after what Mystra asked of you."
Jaheira,Let's not linger long. I have no desire to avail ourselves of a vampire lord's hospitality.
Jaheira,"It is rare to meet so true a believer, child of Gith. Despite reason's every attempt to sway you, you stay your course."
Jaheira,"But it is not just my life, or that of Orpheus - is it? Do you truly believe your queen will save you, when you are no longer of use to her?"
Jaheira,"You have courage, child of Gith. It is no small thing to turn your back on all the ideals of a lifetime."
Jaheira,"For your sake, I hope you are right. But I fear you are not."
Jaheira,"No explanation required. The loyal soldier serves her queen, and receives rewards undying in return. "
Jaheira,And none believe quite so hard as those who have given themselves no other choice.
Jaheira,"Be wary of Lae'zel. She chose loyalty, yes - but there are none so dangerous as those who only believe because they must."
Jaheira,"Halsin long urged the Harpers not to abandon this land to the curse. I cannot blame him, for being unable to bear it a second time."
Jaheira,"The great Orin the Red tugs your sleeve, sulking for attention. She might come to regret it yet."
Jaheira,"You plan to become a god now, do you? And all because your lover spurned you.<br>"
Jaheira,The Iron Throne. Named for the sordid cabal of warmongers it was once headquarters to. No wonder Gortash feels at home.
Jaheira,"We've done what we came to do, and we are all of us sullied for it. Let us make it worth it."
Jaheira,The Gur have been fighting evil longer than this city has stood. It was not for us to gainsay them.
Jaheira,"I have no love for the drow, but she is one of us. We cannot leave her beneath Orin's knife."
Jaheira,I do not mock loyalty. Only mourn when it is given so freely to those so undeserving.
Jaheira,We just played host to an undying queen - and us without our fine silverware.
Jaheira,Orin snatches a child to clamour for our attention. She has it.
Jaheira,"All we achieved was sending the devil home - and damning Wyll along with her. It is a lesson worth learning, I think - that this company discards allies so easily."
Jaheira,And I am in total agreement. See? No arguing.
Jaheira,Understand that I must go with him. He cannot stay by your side - and I cannot abandon him to the Absolute again.
Jaheira,"Repeat that mantra. Make of it a prayer, and see if it will save you."
Jaheira,We can have our reckoning over the rubble afterwards.
Jaheira,"For whose benefit? It is your Lady who draws power from your pain, not I."
Jaheira,"And afterwards, the reckoning."
Jaheira,"I thought the Harpers knew every hidey-hole and rat-run in the city. This place housed something slightly larger than a rat, I think."
Jaheira,Come - they've disturbed my first peaceful sleep in a lifetime. Reason enough to be rid of them.
Jaheira,We'd be fools to retaliate against Cazador by night. But we shouldn't wait long past morning - I doubt the homecoming he plans for Astarion is a happy one.
Jaheira,"Welcome back to the world, Karlach. Try not to break it, yes?"
Jaheira,"Handle the berserker's heart with care, yes? Just because it is made of metal does not mean it cannot be broken."
Jaheira,"We can speak to Karlach of Avernus later. Let her live in this world a little, while she is able."
Jaheira,He is rash - but he is not wrong. I will go with him. Gods speed you in the fight to come.
Jaheira,The ranger has the right of it. I owe you a debt for helping him - but not so much that I can blind myself to the things you have done.
Jaheira,...All right. Then I suppose all that remains is for us to thank you - and wish luck to us all.
Jaheira,Such... certainty. I hope it sustains you in the days to come.
Jaheira,"And when all of this is over, I will hug my children so hard that Rion might kill me from sheer surprise."
Jaheira,"No one truly understands the weight of loss until they've worn it a while. There is no shame in sharing the load, when you need to."
Jaheira,"You yearn for a better class of company, Astarion?"
Jaheira,"In truth - I do not know. I raised them to make their own choices, as your father did you."
Jaheira,"The last spawn who tried was sunk into the cobblestones and left for the sun to find. I had an unfortunate taste for theatrics, in my youth."
Jaheira,"But - still. I am sorry, Wyll. It is a hard thing to lose someone, and wonder if you might have saved them."
Jaheira,I did not know Duke Ravengard that well - but I'm sure he would not want his son to become slave to Zariel for his sake.
Jaheira,"By the stars, it is probably not even the most foolish cause that has seen mortals rise to divinity."
Jaheira,"The things our companion has done... they might never be set right. But so long as we are still willing to try, then I know I am in the right company."
Jaheira,Ever will Shar try to twist bonds of love into chains of service. You did not let her.
Jaheira,"I cannot presume to know your parents, or what they suffered - but I know that they were proud, in the end."
Jaheira,"Proof that he is back to normal, no?"
Jaheira,"Karlach. Recall that I am an old woman, and you cannot strike me for asking stupid questions."
Jaheira,How are you?
Jaheira,No. I am sorry.
Jaheira,"On second thought, I think I would prefer it if you hit me."
Jaheira,I wish I could make some sense of all this for you. I cannot. But I do know this.
Jaheira,I have fought hollow shells of men who clawed for more life as if it was their gods-given right. And not a one of them would've known what to do with it if they had succeeded.
Jaheira,...I hope that arsehole died afraid.
Jaheira,"All right, now. Watch your language."
Jaheira,Eh. Live a little.
Jaheira,Agreed. I have been spending too much time with the wild and rebellious youth.
Jaheira,"It matters. If you cannot live as you wish, then you can at least die as you choose."
Jaheira,"It makes me feel better, at least. If that makes me selfish, then I suppose I am selfish."
Jaheira,Shar believes us so fearful of pain that we would empty our lives of all other feeling just to escape it.
Jaheira,"And still you signed his contract. Perhaps it was the wiser course, but I have trouble believing our problems can be solved so easily."
Jaheira,The Harpers have known many defeats - but slinking from this land when the shadow-curse first fell was one of our most shameful.
Jaheira,"Thank you, for doing what we could not. You and Halsin both."
Jaheira,I sometimes wondered if Viconia had returned to the Underdark. But instead she brought her sordid little patch of darkness to the city with her.
Jaheira,So Shar - and who knows what other gods - fight over the Prism like brats over boiled sweets. And it is the mortal realms that suffer.
Jaheira,The devil's den is every bit as gaudy as I would have imagined.
Jaheira,It is said vampires only make a show of feeling - that their only true emotion is hunger. But those screams sounded real enough.
Jaheira,"Seven thousand souls, Astarion. That is all it cost to inherit your master's power. His position. His very fine palace."
Jaheira,"Its enemies, I trust you mean. And without your hunger, you have little need to feed on living creatures."
Jaheira,"I believe you. In this very moment, at least. But you might live long enough to forget your promises. The meaning of hunger, pain and fear."
Jaheira,"I am sure Wyll knows that - but we would do well to remind him, when his days grow dark."
Jaheira,"Do not force the people of this city to remind you, as you reminded Cazador."
Jaheira,"Gale is a better man than most, to choose what is right even after what Mystra asked of him. "
Jaheira,"Harpers are supposed to be virtuous. But if I had my tormentor at my mercy, the means to punish him at hand... "
Jaheira,I am not sure I would have the grace to give him such a quick death.
Jaheira,True. But not half the horror he had earned. 
Jaheira,"Careful, Astarion. Despite your every effort to the contrary, I am in danger of thinking you might be a good man."
Jaheira,"Yes, there is."
Jaheira,"Besides, take heart. Your tadpole may yet burst from your skull before it comes to that."
Jaheira,Well-spoken.
Jaheira,A few dozen times.
Jaheira,"If you feel you are being watched, take comfort - that is only because you are. "
Jaheira,The colony knows we are here. Already I can hear the whispers.
Jaheira,"Just sweet nothings for now. It tests me - wants to know why I do not carry a tadpole, as you do."
Jaheira,"Hah, a sharper sense than that. That of painful experience."
Jaheira,"A colony is a sentience, comprised of the collective. For anything outside of that collective - assimilation, or annihilation."
Jaheira,"If it tries to dominate me, turn me against you... well. I have seen you fight. I'm sure you'll be fine."
Jaheira,If you can call this living.
Jaheira,"That pointy-hatted old fart talks too much. But he has also moved mountains, walked between planes, and dragged himself back from death a dozen times."
Jaheira,"Cazador is keen to greet his wayward son once more - with open arms, or iron shackles."
Jaheira,"In another lifetime, I might have stood on the other side of that fight. We can call it a lesser evil, but it did not feel like one."
Jaheira,"The Gur are wise, but they do not know you. They do not believe that you can rise above your hunger - for blood, or power. Please prove them wrong."
Jaheira,Far from me to judge Gale for playing coy with Mystra. But I will not be cleaning up whatever mess she makes of him for it.
Jaheira,Come. The great General flees us - but he left a trail to follow.
Jaheira,Breathe deep - that is the true scent of Baldur's Gate assaulting your nostrils.
Jaheira,"Lae'zel will not break easily - but Orin will only enjoy her work the more for that, if we give her the time."
Jaheira,"Me, I think I would have tugged the great goddess' hair a bit first."
Jaheira,"A sad shrine kept by the lunatic and the lost. The last time I was here, I promised myself I would die beneath open sky. I have not changed my mind."
Jaheira,"Hope. The very hook from which these devils try to hang us. I have no answers - for you, or for Wyll."
Jaheira,"But if Mizora means to linger with us, I mean to find out if devils do indeed sleep - and just how heavily."
Jaheira,"Long enough, at least - for us to do what must be done."
Jaheira,"My Harpers are stationed below. Should Ketheric's main force catch wind of our assault and move against us, they will hold the tower."
Jaheira,"I don't doubt it - but I'd come with you, if you'll have me."
Jaheira,I certainly do.
Jaheira,Karlach needs time. Space. 
Jaheira,"But more than this, I think. She needs to know she is not alone."
Jaheira,And answers. Justice. Ten years of her life back. All manner of things we cannot give her.
Jaheira,She's already lost her heart. She deserves better than to have her friends heap happy lies upon her.
Jaheira,"Good. Perhaps she needs that, too."
Jaheira,"Trust me. With the grand wisdom of centuries, I can make no more sense of this than you."
Jaheira,Good hunting.
Jaheira,"Baldurians think all druids to be hay-haired idlers, Halsin. Perhaps we ought not speak of nature - but high art, or politics?"
Jaheira,My Harpers and I will hold the tower while we can - and wait to hear when the deed is done.
Jaheira,"You have numbers enough already, I think. You'll want a small force, if you are to finish this quickly."
Jaheira,"But the sooner we reach Ketheric and rob his army of their reason to fight, the better."
Jaheira,"If our luck holds, they won't need to. If it doesn't, well - they are Harpers. Being outnumbered is part of the job."
Jaheira,"Ketheric must die, and the Absolute with him. We will work out the details as they rear their ugly heads."
Jaheira,Theory and supposition. None of which will helps us in the fight to come.
Jaheira,But if you have room for one lone soldier - I would face Ketheric by your side.
Jaheira,"Better they stay here, and hold the tower should Ketheric's army catch wind of our assault."
Jaheira,Then there's two of us.
Jaheira,"That's a fate we'll all share, sooner or later. But speaking as one who has managed to put it off for so long..."
Jaheira,"I wish I could. But she alone knows what awaits her in Avernus, and she has made her choice."
Jaheira,Give me some time. I... need to think.
Jaheira,"If she cannot have the life she wants, she will at least die as she chooses."
Jaheira,"The last time Bhaalspawn walked the world, it was only to serve their father's design. We got lucky in averting it once."
Jaheira,"So ally yourself with Gortash if you see some benefit in it, and we'll reckon with him when we must. It is your Orin you must face, in the end - and your father."
Jaheira,"Consider me put in my place. Clearly, I have been spending too much time among the city-folk."
Jaheira,"Archdruid. You appear to gather a rather fanatic following wherever you go. A noble thing, to serve nature so tirelessly."
Jaheira,"He managed it. After murdering my husband, and torturing my friends and I for half a year."
Jaheira,"So you wish to be a god, Gale? You know the wizard Irenicus attempted the same thing, by leeching divine blood from a Bhaalspawn."
Jaheira,Why? Do you require some instruction on how the deed is done?
Jaheira,"Nor did Cazador, it seems."
Jaheira,"I said a peek behind the city's mask, Astarion - not a look up its skirts."
Jaheira,Never mind the shining squares - I am more comfortable on streets such as this. A peek at the true face behind the mask.
Jaheira,I count my blessings every day.
Jaheira,Minsc - 
Jaheira,"First, let us just get to the Guildhall. We can puff out our chests and figure out what to do once we are there."
Jaheira,Enough. I put my faith in you - thought you someone worth following. Do not make a fool of me.
Jaheira,"I am not blind to the way this party had conducted itself of late. If you propose to lead us, you will have to be better than this."
Jaheira,Ketheric awaits. What do you need from me?
Jaheira,"I was ready to advise you to make common cause with Viconia, if it would have served the city."
Jaheira,Ever will Shar try to twist bonds of love into chains of service. Shadowheart did not let her.
Jaheira,"I cannot presume to know her parents, or what they suffered - but I know that they were proud, in the end."
Jaheira,This ritual Astarion's spawn-kin spoke of - it seems his master has prepared a homecoming.
Jaheira,I'll not trust a word that slithers out of Gortash's mouth. I need to hear it from you.
Jaheira,"Choose your words carefully. There is a difference between what is true, and what is right."
Jaheira,"I will not lie, and tell you that this does not cause me to doubt. But... it doesn't change anything."
Jaheira,"What you were, the things you must have done... you cannot set it all to rights. But if you are still willing to try, then I am still with you."
Jaheira,"Denying Gortash was the easy part. Come - it is your father we must face, in the end."
Jaheira,...I do not know.
Jaheira,Minsc is an old friend - perhaps my oldest. We fought at one another's backs times beyond counting. 
Jaheira,"Why spare her feelings, then? Go to her. Tell her."
Jaheira,"So your mysterious artefact, tamer of parasites - is only another parasite itself."
Jaheira,I thought we fought the same fight. Perhaps we do still - and I was only wrong about which side of it you stood on. 
Jaheira,"No more. You are free to forge your own path, but I will follow you no further."
Jaheira,"I bear some blame for what you have become. I was so eager to take up my blades again, I did not look hard enough at what use I put them to."
Jaheira,"Kill the Absolute - and should you die in the attempt, it would be a better end than you deserve."
Jaheira,I cannot give you the death you deserve. Not without damning the city along with you. But I will not stay at your side a moment longer.
Jaheira,"Was this your purpose all along, then? To aid me in saving my friend, only to trade him like cattle at the first convenience?"
Jaheira,"He betrayed them, but only in the hopes of saving them. It will comfort the others little to know that."
Jaheira,"I never met Zevlor, but the way his people spoke of him... hatred, but grief as well. For the man they thought he was."
Jaheira,"Grand Duke, is it? I'd follow Wyll into battle, sure enough - but politics? I think I am perhaps too faint of heart."
Jaheira,I suppose we will have to see if this House of Hope is open to visitors.
Jaheira,"I don't know. But if he comes asking for it, I hope you have more to offer him than your judgement alone."
Jaheira,"I will admit a petty sort of pleasure in your making the goddess look a lackwit, cleric."
Jaheira,I will admit a petty sort of pleasure in watching Shadowheart make the goddess look a lackwit.
Jaheira,'The Blade of Avernus'. I suppose hell is just another frontier.
Jaheira,"You've found a little bit of yourself again. Do not let Selûne take all of the credit - she may have lit the way, but it is you who took the step."
Jaheira,"Shadowheart has found a little bit of herself again. Selûne cannot take all of the credit - she may have lit the way, but it is the cleric who took the step.<br>"
Jaheira,"They say that the only thing a vampire can feel is hunger. Nothing else touches them - not grief, or mercy. Or any sense of what is just.<br>"
Jaheira,Who knows. There is often more ignorance than insight in what 'they' say.
Jaheira,"The wizard is a twit, but he is not a fool. Our ruse will buy only a short reprieve - we ought to tell Dame Aylin."
Jaheira,Do not trust a word that slithers out of Lord Liar's mouth. It suits the cult to have us divided - doubting one another.
Jaheira,None of us know every detail of one another's past. But we know who we are now - together.
Jaheira,All hail the mighty Sharran. A-glow with some victory she cannot even recall.
Jaheira,May I.
Jaheira,"Nor will Minsc, I think. His choices are his own, but he has always been swifter to sniff out rot than I."
Jaheira,Whatever time remains to her is precious. She deserves to know just who she is wasting it on.
Jaheira,I have seen friends die before. But to do the deed myself... 
Jaheira,"But I think, perhaps, that I have gone as far as I am able. I will take Minsc back to his home, in Rashemen. And after that..."
Jaheira,"How do you feel, knowing the cost of keeping your transformation at bay?"
Jaheira,I suppose there is something to that.
Jaheira,"Illithids are monstrous creatures. But... in the end, they are only that. Creatures. "
Jaheira,"And if it can, a parasite will keep its host fat, happy, and safe. Until it is finished feeding, at least. Am I comforting you? I am not comforting myself."
Jaheira,"Use the Emperor, as it would use you. Or discard it. My days of doubting you are done."
Jaheira,"Still is, probably. Along with a tadpole that, lest we forget, is just waiting for a chance to split your skull."
Jaheira,"I want to say yes. But then, I was happy to work with a tainted True Soul when it suited my ends."
Jaheira,No notions of heroism put you above human failings. I should know - I've had my share of songs written about me.
Jaheira,Far from me to judge you for playing coy with Mystra. But I will not be cleaning up whatever mess she makes of you for it.
Jaheira,"The General will call that a 'tactical retreat', I'm sure. But you have him on the run."
Jaheira,"I would journey to this path's end, my friend - but if you will not bring Minsc along... for all my debt to you, I owe him a deeper one."
Jaheira,You've freed Minsc from the cult's influence. Now it is for me to ensure that he stays that way for as long as I can.
Jaheira,Why go so far - do so much to save my friend - only to cut him down?
Jaheira,If I thought the city had despoiled the nature above - that harbour water was far from a sparkling blue.
Jaheira,"I've spent over a century in this city, and still I cannot be sure there isn't more below the streets than above them."
Jaheira,"Wyll is a good man, and that is exactly what his devil will use to bind him, in as many ways she knows how."
Jaheira,"Leave Aylin to her sorrow. Likely the wizard only reminds of her of all the other fools, past and present, who have sought to use her.<br>"
Jaheira,That preening vulture seems intent on haunting our camp. I suppose we shall find out if her kind sleep - and how heavily.
Jaheira,"I think that if I had the chance to snatch someone I loved from the jaws of death, I would not be asking for anyone else's opinion."
Jaheira,"You are a good man, Wyll - and that is what your devil will use to bind you, in as many ways as she knows how."
Jaheira,"A man might twist himself into something else, just to escape that collar - but I have no such fears for the Blade."
Jaheira,Was it some trick of the tadpole - to have me turn my blade on my own?
Jaheira,"Well, I think this city is finished with me. I am certainly finished with it."
Jaheira,I know you did everything you could. More than I had any right to expect. And I have no doubt that you are more than a match for this cult.
Jaheira,"Street wailers spin stories from the Time of Troubles, and they save the strangest ones for Minsc. It happens that in his case, most of them are true."
Jaheira,"Come on, then. Likely you have some pointed questions, but you shall have to get in line behind my dear, dear daughter."
Jaheira,"Perhaps. He's not the first one lost to the cult, and unlikely to be the last."
Jaheira,You're the boss.
Jaheira,"The Undercity is perilous, but I recall Minsc making a home down there in the old days. 'To plant his boot on the very bosom of evil', or some such."
Jaheira,"I'll mark an entrance I know - from there, we shall just have to follow our noses."
Jaheira,That was horrible.
Jaheira,Now now - I need a moment.
Jaheira,Speak.
Jaheira,"Well - first things first, I owe you an apology. I did not tell you of all I hoped to find in the city."
Jaheira,"Ah. The guildmaster wishes to see us, does she? Better we call on her home than she call on ours. Lead, then."
Jaheira,Ah. I know what she speaks of. I need... information from her. And a pardon from you - for I have not been overly generous with the truth.
Jaheira,"I have. And while I do not love my conclusion, that does nothing to change it."
Jaheira,"The Harpers are the city's best information network. With them out of action, we shall have to fall back on second-best."
Jaheira,Nine-Fingers Keene.
Jaheira,"Nine-Fingers is much more than a thief. Nothing happens in this city that she doesn't learn of, sooner or later."
Jaheira,"'Friend' is not the word I'd use. Nor is 'petty', if you've a mind to keep your tongue."
Jaheira,But both our operations step outside the law when needful. She just likes it better there.
Jaheira,"Nor are we. But I trust she knows the value of collaboration, especially in times like these."
Jaheira,"If it does not, you have led a very virtuous life indeed."
Jaheira,"Nine-Fingers Keene controls the Guild, which in turn controls every criminal racket from Heapside to the High Hall."
Jaheira,"Nothing happens in this city that she doesn't hear of, sooner or later."
Jaheira,"Are you... well? You have a rather vacant, tadpole-finally-ate-my-brain look about you."
Jaheira,How hospitable she will be to a Harper that comes begging to her Guildhall... we will find out. Perhaps I will let you do the talking.
Jaheira,"Lead, then. Nature's servant awaits."
Jaheira,I wonder if Gortash knows just who it is he is dealing with.
Jaheira,"No matter, boy. I have another here. And I won't find the place disturbed at all, will I?"
Jaheira,"Well, it doesn't matter. Because coming home is the best part."
Jaheira,"You little sneak-thief. Well, they were wrong - look. Not dead. I just... went away for a time. To a place called Moonrise Towers."
Jaheira,"Keen eye. But if it's supplies you seek, weapons to aid in our fight - you won't find them behind that door."
Jaheira,There is nothing back there of worth to anyone but me.
Jaheira,"It should be no surprise to you, that Harpers like to hold their secrets close. Whether there is sense in it or not."
Jaheira,"On my word. All you will find inside is dust, and the mouldering keepsakes of a much younger woman."
Jaheira,"...You so rarely make a habit of being right, ranger, that it puts me ill at ease when you are."
Jaheira,Brave. I can never quite trust my breath after taking the beast-form.
Jaheira,"We faced Bhaal there once before, and I was not ready to count on luck a second time. But luck had no part in it - just you."
Jaheira,"That is both Chosen beaten, and their stones wrested from their grasp. But where they fall, the elder brain rises."
Jaheira,"It is already worming its way free. We must find it before it slips its collar, whether we are ready or not."
Jaheira,And now it is Gortash's turn. We'll need his stone to finish this - however you plan to acquire it. So let us go pay Lord Liar a visit.
Jaheira,Minsc certainly made his home in that hideout - but he's up to something somewhere else.
Jaheira,"Congratulations are in order. I fancied myself the sage advisor, sworn to guide you through what it means to be a child of Bhaal."
Jaheira,And while I mulled on that solemn responsibility - you went and took care of it on your own.
Jaheira,Well done. Truly.
Jaheira,The path of a Bhaalspawn is not an easy one - nor does it ever truly end.
Jaheira,"But you found your footing where so many before you have fallen. Wherever you lead from now, we will follow."
Jaheira,I believe you have an appointment with a Netherbrain.
Jaheira,"Oh, to be so innocent. "
Jaheira,"There might be, but... it is not a path I'd tread until we must. "
Jaheira,Let it wait until the city proper. Perhaps I'll have had a better idea by then.
Jaheira,You have enough fine young folk to run around and do your bidding. Come back when they need a rest.
Jaheira,"We were the first to discover the cult. And if you had only waited, we might have marshalled our numbers and -"
Jaheira,I would like to see if a lesson has been learned.
Jaheira,You mean the doppelgangers? It is no comfort to me that my face made this fool all the easier to lead. The point remains.
Jaheira,"On that point, I am still to be convinced."
Jaheira,"I have seen too much to believe destiny has taken our side. Blind luck, perhaps. The point remains."
Jaheira,"You meant well, Minsc. But you exposed the city to harm. You helped the cult spread. And worse, perhaps, than any of this:"
Jaheira,You forced me to leave you behind.
Jaheira,...I fight alongside fools.
Jaheira,I asked for your help. Set us on course for what happened at the Guildhall. So perhaps I have no right to question.
Jaheira,But whatever your feelings on Nine-Fingers - whatever mine - I cannot see how we served the city by putting the Zhentarim in her place.
Jaheira,"I have no illusions about who Astele was. She was a criminal. A brute, even, when she had to be."
Jaheira,"Well, at least you're getting to know him a little better."
Jaheira,"You know better than to believe our victory is some destined thing. I need to be sure that Minsc knows it, too."
Jaheira,...My own foolishness does not absolve Minsc of his.
Jaheira,"But her every act, even those I opposed, was done in service to her city. No matter her personal feelings."
Jaheira,"...I missed him, too. And try as you might, I know you have not missed my point as neatly as you pretend."
Jaheira,"That instinct is what allowed our alliance to endure so long as it did - that she could place her personal feelings aside, and do what she thought best for the city."
Jaheira,"So it seems I must honour that, and do the same. But mark my words: when the Absolute is finished, when all of this is done - the city will feel her loss."
Jaheira,"Later, then. I'd tell you not to get in trouble, but I suspect it will find you whether you like it or not."
Jaheira,Back and forth. You're like to make me dizzy.
Jaheira,You're sure?
Jaheira,"We are a little ways from our camp here. You'll just have to put up with me, for now."
Jaheira,"I ought to be saying that to you, girl. Only one of us here clawed her way free of the Hells themselves."
Jaheira,"But if you insist on calling me ma'am, I'll happily snap a few orders while you do all the work?"
Jaheira,"Ah. I know that one. They say I turned the very blades of grass against her. Her staff of office leapt into my hand, naming me its rightful wielder."
Jaheira,"Close. When I realised she was far the better mage, I snatched it from her and used it for a club. I fear I do not live up to campfire tales."
Jaheira,"Pfft. Do not feign smallness, girl - it doesn't suit you. I am the follower here. Though I would ask we keep the jumping to a minimum."
Jaheira,"Leave idols to the druids - we already tie ourselves in knots over them. Let me be your follower instead. Your friend, even."
Jaheira,"But if you need proof that I am flesh and blood, Karlach, and none the fresher for it - perhaps we might train together at camp."
Jaheira,"Look alive, girl! Recall our arrangement - I give the orders, you do all the work."
Jaheira,See if you still feel the same afterwards.
Jaheira,My Harper pin. Was a certain little sneak-thief playing down in my sanctuary?
Jaheira,Now - lead on.
Jaheira,That depends entirely on the quality of bard you listen to.
Jaheira,That speaks well of your taste. I've heard my share of bad ballads about things I never did.
Jaheira,Ask it.
Jaheira,"Nothing so grand. He was just another broken little Bhaalspawn, who tried to clamber to glory over the corpses of others."
Jaheira,"There was a time when he might have made more of himself - he was certainly given the chance, after we threw him down."
Jaheira,But he slunk back into his father's shadow instead. There is nothing more to say of him.
Jaheira,"As do you, now. And all our hands are stained by association. I can see the greater good in it, should it lead us to Orin."
Jaheira,"To which we've added a low and craven chapter. I can see the greater good in it, should it lead us to Orin. "
Jaheira,"Now is not the best moment to leave. You'll just have to put up with me, for now."
Jaheira,"Oh, so kind. And so naive."
Jaheira,"...As you say, then. My friend is saved, and we have another ally in the fight against the Absolute."
Jaheira,Ignore my friend. They hit their head very very hard. They are in danger of it happening again.
Jaheira,Ignore my friend. He hit his head very very hard. He is in danger of it happening again.
Jaheira,"It is you who holds the key to defeating Ketheric, not I. Do what you must. If it rids us of this cult, we'll consider the price well-paid."
Jaheira,"Then by all means, don't let me keep you. We can't end this until Ketheric can bleed. I await your next report."
Jaheira,I fear we do not have the luxury of time. Last Light has fallen - we alone remain to stop Ketheric from marching on the city.
Jaheira,"No dream, then. A nightmare."
Jaheira,"No reward, I promise you. A curse."
Jaheira,Once Ketheric is dealt with... then. Then we shall speak of this.
Jaheira,Once we've reached the city... then. Then we shall speak of this.
Jaheira,And hoped never to again.
Jaheira,"She's right, Minsc. She's been an ally down through the years. A friend, even."
Jaheira,Wait - what are you doing?
Jaheira,"A projection. Let us find her in the flesh, then - so I can give her a hug."
Jaheira,I... am well.
Jaheira,"I'm not fool enough to think I can change your mind. But if you're staying, I don't want you taking up arms - there are other ways to fight."
Jaheira,"...You shame me. In all our hunting, I had put them from my mind."
Jaheira,"Aye aye, commander."
Jaheira,Wait. One more thing - there are doppelgangers on our trail. One even went so far as to steal my face.
Jaheira,That's my girl.
Jaheira,Wait. One more thing. There are doppelgangers among the cult - be on your guard.
Jaheira,I remember. The very reason Jord had so many patients to hone his craft on.
Jaheira,"But... fine. As you will. My own plans lie ruined back in that inn, amidst the corpses of my Harpers."
Jaheira,"Back to himself, for better or worse."
Jaheira,Well done. Did you learn how we might untether Ketheric from this Nightsong?
Jaheira,"What?! So all this time, he has been leeching his life from an immortal? The man is more parasite than that thing in your head."
Jaheira,"Already at home in your new skin. They never took your heart, girl - they never even touched it."
Jaheira,Damnation at the flick of a switch. You cast your allies aside easily.
Jaheira,"The limpet clings on. Young Wyll had parasite problems well before the tadpole, it seems."
Jaheira,"He can relax, then. He has nothing to fear from me. But you -"
Jaheira,You should have studied Chelvin before you stole her face. She wasn't much of a smiler.
Jaheira,"...I am sorry, Karlach. Truly I am. But come - it is not a decision you must make this moment."
Jaheira,"I suppose this place is no worse for wear than my last lodgings. Though I cannot say the same for myself, I fear."
Jaheira,"The battle, the escape after... I might need to lick my wounds a while, before I can be of use to you."
Jaheira,I need a little time. But I will gladly join you at journey's end - so long as it leads to the grave of General Ketheric Thorm.
Jaheira,"The time for words will come, when we lay my Harpers to their final rest. I owe them that."
Jaheira,But first - I owe them justice. Moonrise must fall.
Jaheira,"You have already made that choice. You returned Ketheric's relic to him. Perhaps you won his favour - but now you must face the full force of his power, alone."
Jaheira,You know your task. This relic - find it. Strip Ketheric of its power.
Jaheira,"You know your task. Ketheric Thorm clawed his way free of death. Find out how, so we can send him back."
Jaheira,Yes? You have news?
Jaheira,You've learned so much? That tadpole in your head already begins to pay dividends.
Jaheira,"This relic must be your focus instead, then. Find it. Strip him of its power."
Jaheira,"Once Ketheric is without his shield, the sword: together we assault his tower, and put a final end to this blight."
Jaheira,"To earn a meeting where you will face him alone, at the height of his powers?"
Jaheira,"What?! So all this time, he has been leeching his life from an immortal? The man is more parasite than anything in his True Souls' heads."
Jaheira,We're working on it.
Jaheira,"Of course, girl. You can help me determine who it is doing all the snoring."
Jaheira,"You can point that smug little smile somewhere else, for a start."
Jaheira,You are a very irritating girl.
Jaheira,"If you are trying to help me, please stop."
Jaheira,"Oh, Malar's mark. An ambush."
Jaheira,You're angry. I understand. But I tried to give you word of what was happening - a Sending.
Jaheira,You might have noticed that what I plan and what takes place are not always the same. And if that happens again... the city might fall. The cult might come for you.
Jaheira,"You've let my study turn into a thicket, is this what I am hearing?"
Jaheira,I raised you to be a sweet and kind boy. What happened?
Jaheira,Wards. Family. Life-long irritants. Use whichever term you wish.
Jaheira,"If I am a general, then I can set you scrubbing latrines - yes?"
Jaheira,Hmph. Nature's law in action.
Jaheira,"You see? This one is well-trained. I have no need for you any more, faithless boy."
Jaheira,"I hope you were hibernating, little cub. I can't think of another reason you wouldn't come down to say hello."
Jaheira,Who said?
Jaheira,"You little sneak-thief. Well, they were wrong - look. Not dead. I just... had a few adventures. Like..."
Jaheira,"Never planning on letting that go, are you?"
Jaheira,"No, cub, he does not mean me."
Jaheira,"No, cub, she does not mean me."
Jaheira,"No, cub, they do not mean me."
Jaheira,The very same. We can give that one a happy ending after all.
Jaheira,So why haven't you done it? You were supposed to get the young ones out of the city.
Jaheira,The cleric who cast the Sending was wounded. Should I have sobbed on her shoulder?
Jaheira,Rion -
Jaheira,"Enough, Rion. I taught you better manners than that."
Jaheira,I was talking to Boo.
Jaheira,...I'll ask the hamster.
Jaheira,"I know, old friend. They made a poor imitation at me, bossing you around."
Jaheira,"Too late. But don't worry, I shall try to sob into a pillow tonight so as not to wake the entire city."
Jaheira,"Oh...? I will admit, that is unexpected. Your capture by the cult has taught you something, then."
Jaheira,Cover the hamster's ears. I'm going to scream.
Jaheira,We have discussed matters like this before. You recall what the better part of valour is...?
Jaheira,"Why don't you sidle up to the fire. Sit in it, for all I care - though leave Boo aside first."
Jaheira,Yes. And I begin to wonder if I was not over-hasty.
Jaheira,Ignore my friend. She hit her head very very hard. She is in danger of it happening again.
Jaheira,"We're well stocked with herbs. There's space below for beds - you might make this a healing house, should it come to fighting in the streets."
Jaheira,"Careful, girl. They have a habit of taking against tyrants there. "
Jaheira,This? Still? I thought you'd have found a new obsession by now.
Jaheira,"Look at me, girl. Do I strike you as an aristocrat? Whatever family tree you found in my study, it does not quite wash the scent of 'druid' out, does it?"
Jaheira,"Spare me your salutes, little traitor. You walked me right into that ambush."
Jaheira,Hm. I can't fault your priorities. You'll look after them for me?
Jaheira,"Spare me your salutes, guardswoman. You let us slip right past you."
Jaheira,Such keen senses. I suppose you're up to keep guarding them all while I'm away.
Jaheira,"Oh, Malar's mark. Here we go."
Jaheira,"It has been a hard road. But I can clip you both around the ear to prove I am no ghost, if it would help?"
Jaheira,Jhessem discovered an old family tree in my study. We haven't had a moment's peace since.
Jaheira,I shall be content with that. For now.
Jaheira,You know enough. And so do I.
Jaheira,One cannot embrace a viper - only get entangled by it.
Jaheira,I have no reason to doubt the guildmaster's information. Only her conclusions.
Jaheira,"The Stone Lord she describes sounds nothing like Minsc. As for the name, well... a bad joke, perhaps."
Jaheira,The Time of Troubles ended almost a century and a half ago. I weathered the years between with all the elven grace you have no doubt come to expect.
Jaheira,"No. He is an idiot who pissed off some gutter-mage with a flair for petrification. To this day, I still don't know all the details."
Jaheira,I don't even know how he was freed. Harper work would take me from the city - sometimes for years at a time. 
Jaheira,"The few occasions I visited his monument, well... I took it as a moment for reflection. To think of old friends, and the fight I had to continue in their name."
Jaheira,I cannot call myself a particularly good friend. But I am his friend - and I cannot let Nine-Fingers have him.
Jaheira,"So dramatic. 'Abandoned' is a strong word, for one."
Jaheira,"Minsc must have a way in, but he's never had much use for coin beyond whatever sharp steel it could buy."
Jaheira,Just... help me save him. You might see why I didn't question a bit of peace and quiet.
Jaheira,"Are you sore, Mother Superior? You brought her to the same crossroads you yourself once stood at - but you cannot force her to follow."
Jaheira,"That was much Minsc's feeling, too. Perhaps I shouldn't be working so hard to bring you two together."
Jaheira,"I hope you find yourself amusing, at least. Come, then - to the Counting House."
Jaheira,"Assuming Minsc has not since tripped and fallen into a demi-plane, or some such."
Jaheira,"For every strange situation he finds himself in, he wanders right back out of it again. Just a century later, sometimes."
Jaheira,Only what we heard from Keene. He seems to have sprung up while we were out in the shadow-lands.
Jaheira,"I do not think there will be much care involved, if we let Nine-Fingers get to him first."
Jaheira,It seems that events at Danthelon's have overtaken us. My contact there just sent word - the Harpers have been fractured. Infiltrated by doppelgangers.
Jaheira,What.
Jaheira,Perhaps we might have done something to help - or just fallen into the trap along with them. I have only myself to blame.
Jaheira,"The Counting House. More bastion than bank, I'm afraid."
Jaheira,"Come, then. We need a lead on where these shapeshifters have fled to - let us see what hints they left behind in the vault."
Jaheira,"Besides, we're coming back. All of us."
Jaheira,This is not my first time fighting for the fate of this damned city. I thought I'd die in any one of the last three apocalypses.
Jaheira,I have been wrong every time. Long may it continue.
Jaheira,"Come! We'll never bring the Brain low, trapped down here like fledgling chicks."
Jaheira,I am the first to speak ill of this city. But I never wished to see it burning like this.
Jaheira,Come. We are not beaten yet.
Jaheira,"Karlach deserves a better end than twisting herself into flayer-form. But then, she deserves a long life, too."
Jaheira,"It is for her to make the choice, not I."
Jaheira,You focus on the goal while I slobber on about things I cannot change. Irritating.
Jaheira,...A terrible rallying speech. No poetry. Not even a little pat on the head.
Jaheira,Or perhaps the defect is mine.
Jaheira,...Ha.
Jaheira,Hahahahahahaha.
Jaheira,Bastard.
Jaheira,"When I left Minsc to this fate, I believed I had no choice. I believe it still - we were ignorant of our enemy, unarmed against the cult."
Jaheira,"You saw the fool - hanging on the doppelganger's every word, for no other reason than that it wears my face."
Jaheira,I... am sure you meant that to be comforting.
Jaheira,"Come, then. We need a lead - and bullying this banker ought to make me feel better."
Jaheira,"It is some defect of the mind, I think - to stubbornly insist you are following the light, even as you blunder through the darkness."
Jaheira,"Orin knows the hunt. In one stroke, she places the Harpers beyond our reach - separates us from our pack."
Jaheira,"Until we know who the false-facers are, we cannot trust anyone beyond ourselves."
Jaheira,Geraldus was the last true Harper in the city we could trust - and that availed him little.
Jaheira,"We might have ended it there, cut off at the root. But before I could send for help, Minsc charged in alone."
Jaheira,"It was chaos. He was overrun, dragged down beneath a mass of tentacles."
Jaheira,"I had a choice: stay, and let word of this cult die with us. Or leave him, and live to fight another day."
Jaheira,And would again.
Jaheira,"The world takes much from those who presume to defend it. But, sometimes... you get to take it back."
Jaheira,"So don't be sorry, because I mean to use you if you're willing."
Jaheira,Infection. Indoctrination. Eradication. That has been the fate of everyone the cult has captured so far.
Jaheira,"But it has not been yours - with your help, perhaps it need not be Minsc's, either."
Jaheira,"What we found was the first dark seed of this plot - a circle of cultists, with mind flayers in their midst."
Jaheira,As simply as that? For no other reason than that I asked? 
Jaheira,"The point is moot without a means to find him. Without the Harpers, we shall have to find another path..."
Jaheira,I'll have a better idea of what that is once we're through the gates. It seems I need to reacquaint myself with this damned city.
Jaheira,"Because I was playing the pragmatist, and writing my friend off for dead. Then I met you."
Jaheira,"If I seem suddenly flush with hope and soft feeling, you have only yourself to blame."
Jaheira,You need not preach the cause to me - I've already told you what I sacrificed in its name.
Jaheira,"But only a fool would discard a potential ally like Minsc. He has faced god and illithid both, just as I have."
Jaheira,I'm not asking for promises. Just the chance.
Jaheira,"If I was any kind of friend, I'd have loosed an arrow myself. Or so I thought - until I met you."
Jaheira,...perhaps you two will get along.
Jaheira,"As it happens, everything. He was with me the night I first heard that name, connected to some cult gathering in the Undercity."
Jaheira,There always is - but that is still the fundamental fact of it.
Jaheira,"And the last time I saw him, I left him to die."
Jaheira,Except Geraldus. It has been some time since anyone dared rap my knuckles like you did. No less than I deserve.
Jaheira,"A kindness, I hope. My missteps have cost enough lives."
Jaheira,And I was so busy telling you not to take her bait that I scarcely felt the hook in my own mouth.
Jaheira,"I have not been overly-generous with the truth. I came here to learn of the Chosen, true enough. But I set my Harpers searching for someone else, too."
Jaheira,"A good question - I don't have an answer, yet, so let me offer an apology instead."
Jaheira,"A... shame of mine. Redoubled, because I did not tell you everything sooner."
Jaheira,Tell me - what do you know of a man named Minsc of Rashemen?
Jaheira,Perhaps. He's one of the few people alive who has faced your father before.
Jaheira,Or a stalwart friend to one - that depends entirely on the Bhaalspawn.
Jaheira,"Whatever blow to the head has addled your thoughts, take comfort - you and Minsc have that in common."
Jaheira,"Ah, the empty head. The less forgiving bards might say you two have that in common."
Jaheira,And you still turned out as well as you did? Amazing.
Jaheira,You'll find he can do little to help there. Too much in the habit of blocking enemy blows with his skull.
Jaheira,Do you know - I fear he would be just as happy to meet you.
Jaheira,"Not quite how the ballads describe him, but I suppose there's a certain charm to your version."
Jaheira,Why am I not surprised that young Wyll was well-fed on folk-tales?
Jaheira,"But few know of his fate, I think. I had hoped to keep it that way."
Jaheira,"Larger than the legend, I assure you. Twice as loud, too."
Jaheira,"Am I too sentimental for you? Minsc is a warrior from the Time of Troubles - but more than that, he is an old friend."
Jaheira,"I have no idea. I left no parting words, this time - they already know everything they need to."
Jaheira,Now come - you can gaze into a mirror when all of this is done.
Jaheira,"That is the royal 'we', I think. Little men do not like to share power."
Jaheira,"The same person who walked into the Last Light Inn. Though I might have more trouble tangling you in vines, now you can float."
Jaheira,"And we learned something. One Chosen thinks to send us against the other, while they sit safe behind their defences."
Jaheira,"Good. Ketheric thought he was safe, too."
Jaheira,I need to think a while.
Jaheira,"One final night in the open air, and then back to the city. Rest while you can - I fear that quite a bit of work awaits us."
Jaheira,"I would not linger in this land overlong. But - whatever your business, I will aid you if I can."
Jaheira,Well - are we ready for the road once more?
Jaheira,I've had a lifetime's fill of watching little men puff themselves up with grand titles.
Jaheira,"He's protected by his Steel Watch for now - and Orin will have her own defences, should we choose to play the part of Gortash's bloodhounds."
Jaheira,Perhaps it is uncouth to have taken pleasure in that. I am content to be uncouth.
Jaheira,"We need all three stones to command the brain. It matters little in what order we obtain them, or how."
Jaheira,"Pass, then. Go on. See what it is a foolish old Harper thinks worth hiding away."
Jaheira,"But... do as you will. I have nothing to hide, and I have been content to follow your lead so far."
Jaheira,"Oh, you need not apologise. I only seek to spare you some disappointment."
Jaheira,"Yes, you did. But I might as well spare you the disappointment."
Jaheira,Not a wild-shape I have mastered - just yet.
Jaheira,"You've finally found yourself a following, Mother Superior. And you only had to hollow out their heads to do it."
Jaheira,"Of course. He'll share his rule - what use all his brilliance, if there is no one to bask in it?"
Jaheira,"But even if we unite to command the brain, it's not as if we can leave the city under Bane's boot-heel once it's done. We'd be back to the same old battle."
Jaheira,"...But then, perhaps I make too much of this. How can I beg privacy, when I was not half so trusting on our first meeting?"
Jaheira,The great Archduke's coronation became his funeral rite. At least the flowers will not go to waste.
Jaheira,"The same person I met in the shadowlands. A little thinner, perhaps...?"
Jaheira,The Harpers keep records of those who fought for the city - I think I would recall mention of a bare-assed little cherub in all our story and song.
Jaheira,Amble about if you wish. I plan to claim whatever little rest remains.
Jaheira,The cub speaks.
Jaheira,Huh. Not so much a term of age or affection as simple old habit. You object?
Jaheira,"As you like. No cub, no fun."
Jaheira,'The Cub and the Crow' - sounds like a cautionary tale. As it probably should.
Jaheira,"And will be again. But now I shall mutter them under my breath, out of respect."
Jaheira,The Harper safe-house I spoke of is on the bridge at Wyrm's Crossing - Danthelon's Dancing Axe. 
Jaheira,Information. The Chosen have a head start on us - I'd like to know what they've done with it.
Jaheira,I would be lying if I told you I was certain we would walk out of that temple alive.
Jaheira,"The city's lower intestine, perhaps."
Jaheira,Let us speak later.
Jaheira,And hamsters don't have hackles.
Jaheira,"We three have come through darker places than this together, Minsc."
Jaheira,There's little point in pressing Nine-Fingers further. She means what she says.
Jaheira,I suppose we must greet the local wild-life. The Guildhall is awash with ale-scented gossip at the best of times. 
Jaheira,"Fear not, Rashemaar. It has never been your way to over-indulge."
Jaheira,"A fine thing, to travel in a small pack once more. No doubt Ketheric thinks he has escaped us."
Jaheira,"Speak, so long as you have something sensible to say."
Jaheira,"... do you know, I had forgotten just how catty your hamster can be."
Jaheira,"To work together? Strangely enough, I believe him - he's too self-important to be anything but sincere."
Jaheira,"We cannot expect either of the Chosen to fall easily. But fall they must, if we're to have all three stones to command the brain."
Jaheira,"What is it, cub?"
Jaheira,It is for you to make sure that is so. And your debt will extend far beyond the end of the Absolute.
Jaheira,"It would be irritatingly true to form, would it not?"
Jaheira,We do not know this Prince of the Comet - a thin thread on which to hang all of our hopes. 
Jaheira,"You've made your choice - and us with you, Silvanus spare us. The princeling will save his people - just not in the way he imagined."
Jaheira,How convenient - that the key to our salvation is the very corruption your illithid friend has been asking you to embrace all along.
Jaheira,"When we cannot know, we can only trust. But then, that is exactly what a traitor in our midst would say - isn't it?"
Jaheira,"A Harper learns to doubt. To peer through every smile, question every look. Eventually you find whatever it is you fear, whether it is there or not."
Jaheira,We draw near to the beast's den - where it will be most desperate. I need no tadpole to feel that much.
Jaheira,"Make your choice. Wherever it leads, we will follow."
Jaheira,"You deserve a better end than shredding your soul for our sake. But then, this is not a matter of what is deserved."
Jaheira,Naught but another harvest.
Karlach,Us strongs understand each other. Especially in the empty minutes after a fight you didn't ask for. Or maybe shouldn't have.
Karlach,"I'll be honest, soldier - I'm reeling. Wyll hardly knows me, but he chose my life over his."
Karlach,Been a long time since someone stuck their neck out for me like that.
Karlach,You can say that again. When he was chasing me through Avernus I thought he was just another sad merc. How wrong I was.
Karlach,Sound shrooms. Snake druids take note.
Karlach,Funny how the line between 'fool' and 'hero' is so thin.
Karlach,"Wouldn't be courage without the risk, would it."
Karlach,I'll figure out a way to make it up to him. What do heroes like? Swords... shields... shiny things...
Karlach,"Well, our to-do list is certainly filling out fast."
Karlach,"Look, I think we should go our separate ways. I've spent long enough in the Hells to know a bad situation when I see one. "
Karlach,"This Nere sounds like bad news. I guess we could lend a hand, right?"
Karlach,"Duergar invaders, huh? I'd like to hear their side of the story first, but all right."
Karlach,"She's more than tired. Something's happening inside her. And who could blame her, after what she's endured."
Karlach,Revenge sounds so sweet until you've taken it. Then all you have is... no one left to blame.
Karlach,Tsk. I was afraid of this.
Karlach,I was wrong to think there could've been something between us. We're just too different.
Karlach,"Good luck, soldier. At the rate you're going, you're going to need it."
Karlach,I can't believe I thought you were the one. Maybe I'm still that naive kid after all - the one who'd trust anyone who showed her a bit of kindness.
Karlach,Don't look at me. I just got out of devil hell. I'm not going to fishy hell any time soon.
Karlach,Should I join you?
Karlach, No room in the party 
Karlach,"Ah, it smells the exact same. Ten years on, but still home. Incredible."
Karlach,"I won't forget this, Wyll. Not ever. You may look like a devil, but you're one of the most noble men I've ever met."
Karlach,Gods help whoever she trains her sword on next. But I hope it stays sheathed for a while yet. For her sake.
Karlach,"Can't say I blame you. I can tell you right now, I wouldn't have done the same in your position. But I'm... well, I'm grateful you're better than me."
Karlach,"Oh, I've got your back. Front. Side to side. Name it, and I'm there."
Karlach,How long do you think we're going to last with a wildcard like that in the party?
Karlach,Hopefully longer than I think.
Karlach,"You know, for a while there, I wasn't sure you'd come back from Sharville. But look at you. You've done what few could ever do - created your own path."
Karlach,"Your folks must be so very, very proud of you."
Karlach,Wyll! No... No...!
Karlach,Like watching a lemure eat porridge. Messy and unsettling.
Karlach,"You did this. You killed Mizora, and she took Wyll back to the Hells with her."
Karlach,"There isn't. Wyll made a pact with a devil, then broke it. That means one thing: his soul his hers."
Karlach,"Don't apologise to me. Apologise to him. Not that he'll hear you, where he is."
Karlach,"But he isn't dead, is he? He's a blob of tormented flesh in the Hells. And that's all he'll be - forever."
Karlach,"Hah. Look, I'm sure you'd rather live without 'em, but those babies are absolutely magnificent. As far as I'm concerned, you've never looked better."
Karlach,"Nice. Helps not to judge a book by its cover, doesn't it.<br>"
Karlach,How can this be?! How could this happen so fast?!
Karlach,There was still time. We could've gotten him out of that fucking pact.
Karlach,"Something's coming - and if it lives down here in the dark, it won't be anything good."
Karlach,This might be some devil's ploy. Don't listen to it.
Karlach,"No. Something's coming - and if it lives down here in the dark, it won't be anything good."
Karlach,His life didn't need to end like this. He had time - so much time. And where is he now?!
Karlach,Wyll. I don't know what to say. I can't believe what you did.
Karlach,I just hope Aylin's as wise enough to sort it out before it sorts her.
Karlach,I'm glad you saw me for who I am. And - and I think I can see who you really are too. A hero.
Karlach,"I'm grateful I get to travel with you, Wyll. You may look like a devil, but you're one of the most noble men I've ever met."
Karlach,With the press of a button. Just like that.
Karlach,Been a long time since someone stuck their neck out for me like that. How can I thank you?
Karlach,"Cruelty like that poisons the soul 'til one day, you drop dead - or the person you're fucking with snaps and puts a sword in your eye."
Karlach,My pleasure
Karlach,Good - I'm going to hold you to it.
Karlach,Then get on board. Gortash dies - the moment we have the chance.
Karlach,"I won't go rushing in again, but you have to promise we'll kill him before this is said and done."
Karlach,"Poor guy looks like he could really use a hand. I've got two, hey?"
Karlach,Adamantine. Bet we're near the forge. Wonder if I could melt that stuff...
Karlach,"If he winds up, I'm gonna snap his neck - if the rothé don't stomp his lights out first."
Karlach,But we'll get him - won't we? Together.
Karlach,"Well you've already won that debate. Until the Steel Watch is done away with, Gortash can't be touched."
Karlach,I get that. I didn't do myself any favours getting tossed in this pit anyway.
Karlach,"Look - I won't go rogue again, but I'm not letting that fucker off the hook."
Karlach,"Not me, soldier. Not ever."
Karlach,Then we keep him around long enough to get what we need. And not a moment longer. All right?
Karlach,Absolutely not. The gnomes walk free. Right?
Karlach,Whoa. What?! You can't be serious.
Karlach,"Pft. Sure, they can take the gnomes. Over our dead bodies. Right?"
Karlach,We'll get him together - as soon as we can. Right?
Karlach,You better be damn sure about that. And that 'need' better have a time limit.
Karlach,"Yeah, right. No chance we're letting those bastards take the gnomes with them. Right?"
Karlach,Promise me we'll kill him before this is said and done.
Karlach,Yeah. We'll need to take them down if we want to get a clear shot at Gortash.
Karlach,"I won't go rogue again, but I'm not letting that fucker off the hook - that's for damn sure."
Karlach,My gods. What in all Nine Hells is wrong with you?!
Karlach,I'm going to pretend you didn't just say that.
Karlach,You'll help me - right?
Karlach,What's that? Went after the prick who ruined my life? What would you have me do - turn tail and run? 
Karlach,I'll go there.
Karlach,Then you better be ready to see me run him through myself.
Karlach,Hah. Bastard can dream on. Right?
Karlach,Please tell me you've seen sense.
Karlach,You don't control me. No one controls me. Accept that or don't.
Karlach,Finally. Let's get out of here.
Karlach,PRAISE MAHKLOOMPAH!
Karlach,And what's that?
Karlach,Didn't realise I needed your permission to kill the fucker who ruined my life.
Karlach,No way we're letting these bastards take those gnomes. Right?
Karlach,Party's full. I'll wait for you at camp. Got a lot to think about anyway.
Karlach,Let's just get the fuck out of here. I'm sick to death of this place.
Karlach,Thank fuck. You scared me there for a moment.
Karlach,You don't mean that.
Karlach,Actually - could you get the boss in here to give me the go-ahead? Last thing I need's another enemy.
Karlach,"Fine. But when we get the chance to strike that arsehole where it hurts, we'll do it together - right?"
Karlach,"Suit yourself. I'll wait around a little, in case you come to your senses. But if you don't come make nice soon, we're finished. Officially."
Karlach,Good. I'm not in the mood to murder anyone but that fucker Gortash.
Karlach,"Troop's already full, so I'll head to camp - try to work on a way to get at Gortash while I have the down time."
Karlach,You can't be serious. What the fuck is wrong with you?
Karlach,Fine by me.
Karlach,I'm fine. I just went to get out of here and finish what we started.
Karlach,"We're not letting that happen, are we?"
Karlach,"An escort to Moonrise, huh? Can't be too far off, then."
Karlach,"Whatever's wrong with you, I hope it's not contagious."
Karlach,"Can't wait to pay these bastards back, lick for lick. Just say the word."
Karlach,I'm... speechless. Wow. Just... just wow.
Karlach,"Go on then. I'll get out of here on my own. Been ten years alone, what's a bit more?"
Karlach, You're no avatar 
Karlach,May I test that theory?
Karlach,What are you waiting for? Crack this cell open.
Karlach,"I'm gonna destroy this place. Rip it apart, board by board."
Karlach,"And a stiff drink, while I'm at it."
Karlach,"Bloody engine isn't cooling down, is it. Guess it wasn't made to work outside Avernus. Hope it holds together long enough to find an infernal mechanic."
Karlach,"Ah, fuck that. Fire's really going for broke, though."
Karlach,Maybe I went a little too far...
Karlach,Deep breaths. I'll be all right. I'll be all right.
Karlach,I'm hot. Very hot. Too hot.
Karlach,"Easy, girl. There's no point now - you already killed them all."
Karlach,Been so long I can hardly remember.
Karlach,"Come at me, Zariel. "
Karlach,Fuck them. Never again.
Karlach,"Come on, girl. Focus."
Karlach,"Gods, that's hot."
Karlach,"There you are. Thought I'd have to track you down myself, murderer."
Karlach,"Hope you're not planning on taking another swing at me, mate. Might not go your way this time."
Karlach,Have it your way.
Karlach,Next best thing to getting laid.
Karlach,But wouldn't it do to send a message? Wouldn't it be oh-so-fucking fantastic to leave nothing behind at all?!
Karlach,"I hope you're watching, Zariel. I hope you see how free I am. And I hope you know I'm never, EVER, EVER GOING BACK!"
Karlach,"Probably not. Nothing's safe - never will be. But I can feel the fire in every vein, and I'm not gonna let it go to waste."
Karlach,That seems measured. I'm measured. Aren't I?
Karlach,"Yes. Save it for when you really need a supercharge in battle. It's the only option, really."
Karlach,Never ever. Ever. Unless...
Karlach,"Hang on, those paladins I need to stomp are that-a-way."
Karlach,"Broken as an old heart, and nothing but dust inside."
Karlach,Damn. Too broken to help us through the shadows.
Karlach,Wonder if that's one of those Moonlanterns.
Karlach,"Perfect. Let's get a move on, then."
Karlach,Some firepower'll help bust open that wall. Then we can free the poor lads inside.
Karlach,"I ought to smack some manners into you, you know that?"
Karlach,Me the beast? Now that's fucking rich.
Karlach,"JUST TRY IT, ZARIEL! COME ON!"
Karlach,Come and get me!
Karlach,Fuck you!
Karlach,That ought to do it.
Karlach,AHAHAHAHA!
Karlach,TEAR IT DOWN!
Karlach,I'm in the process of teaching them a lesson about - 
Karlach,"None at all. In fact, it may upset you to hear some of Zariel's goons are posing as followers of your fella. "
Karlach,"Believe me, these guys are anything but holy knights. They serve an archdevil; the same one I - "
Karlach,Nothing but. But... maybe you don't need to be one of 'em. You're no bounty hunter. I saw you before. On the mind flayers' ship.
Karlach,"The Blood War. But sister, believe me when I tell you that the fighting wasn't even the worst part."
Karlach,"The Blood War. But brother, believe me when I tell you the fighting wasn't even the worst part."
Karlach,"Guess that explains the voices. From that peek I got into your head, you've made some inroads trying to get the thing sorted. But alas, no joy."
Karlach,Fuck's sake. Mountains as far as the eye can see.
Karlach,You with the so-called 'paladins of Tyr'? Or straight from the grand high devil herself?
Karlach,"Met some of the Elturians who got trapped in the Hells, though. They did less time than me, but no easier."
Karlach,Me? I wish.
Karlach,"Stand back, or I'll melt your eyes out of your skull."
Karlach,"Well fuck me. It's you. From the ship. Haven't taken any bounties from a burnt Tyr dink, have you?"
Karlach,"Steady on, soldier. Ahh. That's the stuff."
Karlach,Try again. And pick your next words carefully.
Karlach,"Me and justice are good mates, believe me. The goons chasing me are anything but -"
Karlach,"Me? None. They're the ones chasing me down. But believe me, these so-called paladins are anything but. They - "
Karlach,"Believe me, I never killed anyone who didn't -"
Karlach,"Let me guess: baby-eater, devil-worshipper?"
Karlach,"The truth is... well, it's a long story. And I'll tell it, but - "
Karlach,Nice of you to ask. Lately I've gotten used to being called 'devil'. No follow-up questions.
Karlach,"The Blood War. But believe me, my friend, the fighting wasn't even the worst part.<br>"
Karlach,Better put it away 'til I can use it in battle.
Karlach,"From that peek I got into your head, I'm not the only one with problems on top of problems. A mind flayer tadpole, huh? And no joy getting it sorted as of yet, I see."
Karlach,"Well met, soldier. Now that we're old pals, how would you feel about helping me kill some evil bastards?"
Karlach,What's your name?
Karlach,Right. Some so-called paladins of Tyr are in hot pursuit of yours truly. Karlach.
Karlach,Maybe it'll help if we start with a little fun. How'd you like to help me kill some evil bastards?
Karlach,"Oh boy, an arsehole! Winning you over will be entertaining."
Karlach,"Well, if it isn't obvious by now, he's wrong about me. I'll prove it to him if he stops swinging that sword around long enough to listen to sense."
Karlach,Ugh. Thought I'd lost the Blade of Frontiers on the mind flayer ship. 
Karlach,"All right, sure. But don't get to any of the fun stuff without me. Got it?"
Karlach,Now we're talking.
Karlach,"If you can lead the way, I'll gladly follow."
Karlach,"The first time I faced down those 'paladins,' they let slip they'd met an infernal mechanic in the area. A tiefling. But I didn't see him anywhere."
Karlach,"Burn, baby. As hot as I can tolerate. I have to admit it helps in battle, though I wouldn't have chosen it for myself - if I'd been given a choice."
Karlach,"Won't be seeing my mechanic any time soon, so I've been making the most of the extra heat. But it's meant I can't get too friendly. If I'm excited, nervous, scared, I'll light you up like a firework."
Karlach,"But hey, erm, if we're going to travel together, I think there's something you should know. "
Karlach,"After we've mopped them up, we can work on evicting this parasite and take Faerûn by the short hairs. Sound good?"
Karlach,The latest yappy little dogs she's sicced on me are nearby. A group of dopes posing as Paladins of Tyr. Want to help me take 'em down?
Karlach,"Zariel's sent goon after goon to hunt me down, but believe me when I tell you I'm not going."
Karlach,"So good Zariel, the archdevil herself, made me her personal attack dog."
Karlach,I'm Karlach. And you are...?
Karlach,Consume the coin. Do it.
Karlach,That's it - will keep it on hand for good use and nothing else. Nothing... else...
Karlach,"No. I am good. And good people only use soul coins when they really, really need a pick-me-up."
Karlach,So. The gearhead can't fix this thing.
Karlach,Doesn't matter. What matters is I won't burn off the next hand I shake.
Karlach,"What next, then? Back to Avernus?"
Karlach,I've never considered it an option. The memories are too fresh.
Karlach,I can't go back to Avernus. I can't let her get her claws in me again. Even if it means I... I have to...
Karlach,Die.
Karlach,"Not in the mood for another fight, believe it or not. Can we play nice?"
Karlach,"I'm ready to go, but maybe we should wait before provoking these pricks."
Karlach,"I've seen nasty, but these guys are on their own level. I have a feeling this is gonna end badly."
Karlach,Don't forget the gnomes. I'm not leaving them with their captors.
Karlach,"Free the drow, take his head, get out of here in one piece. Easy as one, two, three."
Karlach,This is our fault. These people died because of us. What were we thinking?
Karlach,"Hells, at least I'd be in good company. Just me and every other mortal in the realm."
Karlach,But the old bucket's got a bit of life in it yet. Enough to get home.
Karlach,"That'll do me. My gods, that'd be enough."
Karlach,But the old bucket's got a bit of life in it yet. Enough to see my city safe.
Karlach,If I can do that - if I can save my home - I can face whatever comes next. No matter what.
Karlach,Ungh... yeah! I've got this... I've got this!
Karlach,Explode.
Karlach,"BURN, BURN, BURN!"
Karlach,I am frost. I am ice. I am Never-fucking-Winter.
Karlach,"Hey - I like you, but I'm starting to get the feeling we're not as like-minded as I'd hoped. I really don't want that to be the case. We make a good team, no?"
Karlach,"If things keep going how they're going, though, I might need to leave. Don't make me. All right?"
Karlach,I want to be a force for good in the world. And I won't stick around if you don't. Last warning. Got it?
Karlach,It's all right... I'm in control. I'm in control.
Karlach,It's your funeral. And mine. I'm not ready!
Karlach,Gotta be done. Let's go.
Karlach,"Reach deep, or I'll kill you myself!"
Karlach,"You just want me to die in a cursed cloud so you can take my boots. Finally, the plot revealed."
Karlach,Agreed. Next stop: Nere.
Karlach,Must be the shadow curse. We'll need Nere's lantern if we want to get through it.
Karlach,Sounds like bad news. I'd just as soon get that Moonlantern off Nere.
Karlach,"Well. That could've gone slightly better. But could've gone slightly worse too. Well done, Karlach. Once again."
Karlach,"Ah. Easy as a blue morning. As you were, all in hand, and onward and onward again."
Karlach,Ngh! Gods - I - I - 
Karlach,I've got this. I can handle this. I can control this. It's all right. It's all right.
Karlach,And just like that... just like that... she proved herself right.
Karlach,I'm cold as ice. There is no fire. Everything is fine.
Karlach,I feel amazing. I've never been more powerful!
Karlach,Are we just going to rot in here or what?
Karlach,"Sounds spectacular, if nothing else. Maybe take out a few mind flayers with the shrapnel."
Karlach,Sometimes - only sometimes - it almost sounds tempting. This thing's practically  wheezing.
Karlach,Yes! I like!
Karlach,"I don't want to know. That's a soul - might make me stronger, but it's not mine to use."
Karlach,...Or is it?
Karlach,"So it is thoughten, so let it be done."
Karlach,"You took the words right out of my mouth, soldier."
Karlach,Whatever killed a bunch of Sharrans might still be down here. Just saying.
Karlach,"Be careful what you wish for, soldier."
Karlach,"I think the evil god of loss can avenge herself, if she needs to."
Karlach,"I'll keep an eye out. If it's a demon, I'll be able to spot it a mile off."
Karlach,"Let's just hope whatever managed to plough through 'em is long dead, too."
Karlach,Better dead than stuck down here. Right?
Karlach,No burial. Just slaughter. Damn.
Karlach,Let's split the difference. I'll only use it when I could really use a little help in battle.
Karlach,"Being a good guy comes with perks, right? Let's give it a bash!"
Karlach,Down the hatch!
Karlach,I should try it out.
Karlach,"I shouldn't, really - it is a soul after all. Zariel might've been happy to use 'em willy nilly, but she was an evil freak."
Karlach,Wouldn't mind a dancing axe of my own.
Karlach,Burn out.
Karlach,Holy shit. A soul coin. Wonder if they work even up here...
Karlach,Like I'm finally complete.
Karlach,I don't want to think about that now. 
Karlach,"And yet it's always there. I guess there's Avernus - that's what Dammon said, right? Go back, be saved."
Karlach,No. I can't let Zariel get her claws in me again. Even if it means I... I have to...
Karlach,"Infinite permutations. Infinite possibilities. Before, they'd have driven me mad. Now, I can see them all."
Karlach,"I'm still the same, aren't I? I'm still me...?"
Karlach,No pain. No gears. A calm I haven't felt in a decade - or ever.
Karlach,This means I'm going to live.
Karlach,I'm going to live.
Karlach,I'm going to...
Karlach,I get to be alive. I get to stay.
Karlach,They deserved better than they got. May they rest in peace.
Karlach,Fuck. Yes.
Karlach,It may be different than I thought. But I can feel. Think. Exist.
Karlach,"My years in the Hells, my escape, every step I've taken from the shattered nautiloid to this place among infinite stars - all of it has brought me to my destiny."
Karlach,First: defeat the Netherbrain. Then: live.
Karlach,"Ooh, are we killing slavers? Me first!"
Karlach,I've never felt better.
Karlach,"Soldier, this is it! We're almost to the city. First through Wyrm's Crossing, then on to the Lower City."
Karlach,We've got this. We're nearly there.
Karlach,"Hang on - what's going on? Stop this, before it's too late!"
Karlach,"We're going to keep Astarion safe. On my life, Cazador won't touch him."
Karlach,"Wish we could stay and see what this place will be like without the shadows. I bet it's beautiful. No rest for the wicked, huh?"
Karlach,"Wide berth, buddy. I have some good equipment I don't want you swallowing."
Karlach,"The people you meet, I swear..."
Karlach,"Much as I commiserate with your, you know, thingie."
Karlach,"Phew. Thought Lae'zel and the walking fringe were gonna come to blows. Would've been entertaining, but I'm not ready to say goodbye to either one just yet."
Karlach,Our girl is nothing if not loyal. I just hope it doesn't come back to bite her in the arse. Being loyal to the wrong person can do that sometimes.
Karlach,Now that's what I call a spide.
Karlach,Hells take that Bhaal-freak. She would've bled the whole world just for the fun of it.
Karlach,We've got her Netherstone now. One step closer to getting the Netherbrain under control.
Karlach,"Ha-mmer, ha-mmer, ha-mmer!"
Karlach,"We need to get that Nere guy unstuck, or those gnomes are done for. Come on, focus."
Karlach,"No one more loyal than our Lae'zel. If Voss had known that, he never would have come here throwing salt on Vlaakith's name."
Karlach,I don't get it. What's got Dame Aylin so down?
Karlach,Hope that good old Aylin holy fervour returns to her soon. I don't like to see her looking so... lost.
Karlach,"Hopefully Dame Aylin will be back to herself by then, so she can congratulate me on a murtherer well-broken."
Karlach,"The Absolute wants the Prism. The githyanki want the Prism. Shar wants the Prism too. Phew, this thing means an awful lot to a lot of people."
Karlach,"Us more than anyone. Without that thing, we'd have been drooling True Souls."
Karlach,You be careful with that amulet. I don't like it. At all.
Karlach,"I'll miss Lae'zel. But I guess it was never going to work with that artefact on the line. May she rest in... well, something more exciting than peace. She deserves that much."
Karlach,I've underestimated you. Won't make that mistake again.
Karlach,Shadowheart versus Lae'zel. I can't believe ol' mysteria defeated a githyanki warrior.
Karlach,And I just... I just let it happen! I couldn't stop them! What the fuck am I good for if not that?! ARGH!
Karlach,"I'm so glad Shadowheart's ordeal is over. It'll be a long time before she'll come to terms with all this. But at least, now, she can start. Free of Shar."
Karlach,"Careful, soldier. I'm used to heat like this, but too much smoke could knock you dead."
Karlach,Come on. We need to get up and out.
Karlach,Finally get to live out my rogue-ish fantasies down here.
Karlach,"Aw, was that your granddad?"
Karlach,"Wow, Gale. So you spoke to Mystra, right?"
Karlach,"Pretty spectacular stuff. But I think you were right not to do her bidding, no questions asked."
Karlach,"Surprised to find I share an aim with Shar herself, but the Absolute has to be stopped. Let Shar have the lost - better that than the Netherbrain."
Karlach,"I respect the gods, but they don't always understand what they're asking of us. Maybe immortality makes it hard to know what it's like to be one of us piggies."
Karlach,Ketheric's waiting for us. Can only imagine the beating that angel is preparing for him.
Karlach,"Thanks to your good sense, we have a chance at beating him. I know it wasn't easy, going your own way - it never is. You're some woman, Shadowheart."
Karlach,"You all right, Gale? Looking a little shadowy about the gills."
Karlach,Is Gale all right? He's looking a little shadowy about the gills.
Karlach,Shadowheart may not be able to remember what she's done. But I'll never forget.
Karlach,"You're glowing, Gale. Mystra must be very pleased with you indeed. Don't forget us little people when you're the Chosen of the God of Magic, hm?"
Karlach,Gale looks chuffed as cheese. Mystra must be very pleased with him. Let's hope she's got his best interests in mind.
Karlach,Isobel. And all those people. What a horrible fucking day.
Karlach,"Proud of you, though. It takes some man to hold his own in front of the divine."
Karlach,"Let me do this, soldier. I can save us. What better way to go out?"
Karlach,"Ah, Wyll. There is such a thing as being too good, you know."
Karlach,"I don't want Zariel to have you. I can't stand it. But... it's done, isn't it?"
Karlach,"Very glad you and Lae'zel settled things without letting any blood. While I would've enjoyed the spectacle, my money's on the githyanki. And I'd hate to lose you, fringe."
Karlach,"Another dead end. If the tadpole doesn't kill us, trying to cure it just might."
Karlach,We're allies - for now - and we have a mission far greater than your... predilections. Stay sane long enough for us to save the city. Then we'll see where we stand.
Karlach,"Lovely! You should've introduced him around. Elders love me, and I love them."
Karlach,"Huh. Doesn't ring a bell. But all right! Must've had something important to say, if he came all this way. Good news, I hope."
Karlach,"The orb in your chest? Shit - I knew something was going on with you, but I didn't know the particulars. "
Karlach,"Only you can decide if that's really true. If you owe her your life. As for me, I'm positive we can stop the Absolute without losing you, Gale."
Karlach,"Keep that in mind, all right?"
Karlach,Thought this place was just a legend. Tall tales just keep coming true.
Karlach,"No kidding. What could be bigger? Look, I know what it's like to house something dangerous inside you. But I don't know what it's like for someone else - someone I trust - to ask me to use it against myself."
Karlach,"Nothing's ever simple anymore, is it? Whatever you decide, I've got your back. But I think we can defeat the Absolute without losing you, Gale."
Karlach,Oh? What did he say?
Karlach,"All right, soldier. But look, if  you're in a fix that can be solved by fire or fists, just point me in the right direction. I mean it."
Karlach,Your grandfather is the most famous wizard in the realms?
Karlach,"I should've guessed. I mean, you're pretty powerful. Makes sense that it's in your blood."
Karlach,I'm listening. What did he say?
Karlach,"So we're going to meet Voss in the city, are we? Set the tenant of the Prism free? This is all very... I don't know. I like a good caper, but I'd long for a tiny bit of status quo now and again."
Karlach,Stinky.
Karlach,"If you need a friend, you know where to find me. Right here. Right now."
Karlach,He could've had it all - but it would've cost his soul. He kept what was worth keeping. That can't have been easy.
Karlach,Hope he knows what he's doing. We haven't fared very well with other Chosens so far.
Karlach,Gale's walking a thin line. Let's hope he doesn't fall headfirst over it - again.
Karlach,"May we all live up to the standard you set, Wyll. Somehow."
Karlach,"Saving the city we love, for one. And for me, trying to live up to the standard you set."
Karlach,I hope being a rampaging bloodsucker is everything Astarion dreamed it would be.
Karlach,"Damn, Lae'zel. It can't have been easy to stand up to Vlaakith like that. But there's nothing Lae'zel of Crèche K'liir of can't do."
Karlach,Well done getting that creep off Dame Aylin's tail. The last thing she needs is more trouble dogging her heels.
Karlach,Tsk. I hate seeing Shadowheart suffer like this. All for doing the right thing.
Karlach,"It's up to us to look after her now. If she needs a rest, we carry her. If she needs a hand, she has ours. If she needs ears, we've got four between us. Whatever she needs."
Karlach,"Can't believe that devil just took us into the Hells with a snap of his fingers. If I see him again, I'll wring his neck."
Karlach,"Wow. Gale is the 'Chosen of Mystra'. Congrats to him, I think?"
Karlach,"Better to die than live in a cambion's debt. Believe me. No offence, Wyll."
Karlach,Better to die than live in a cambion's debt. Believe me. 
Karlach,"Raphael - that's his name, right? He's trying to lure us into a game he knows we can't win. Don't let him."
Karlach,I knew I liked you.
Karlach,"Raphael was his name, right? He's trying to lure us into a game he knows we can't win."
Karlach,I'm not playing. Glad you're not either.
Karlach,"I could just feel it. Evil, radiating out of every bloody apple."
Karlach,Ready to save the world?
Karlach,"Hope you know what you're doing, Gale. I'm no paladin for Mystra, but she probably has good reasons for forbidding Shadow Weave."
Karlach,"Look, this - Raphael, was it? He's trying to lure us into a game he knows we can't win. Don't let him."
Karlach,There we have it. You were working with Gortash. You were a chosen of Bhaal. I guess you still are.
Karlach,"Astarion would hate this, but I'm so fucking proud of him."
Karlach,"This fella Gale has as many lives as a cat. Handy guy to have around, huh?"
Karlach,"You did the right thing, Wyll. Your father will die with honour. He will go with the gods. If you sacrificed yourself, you'd be lost forever."
Karlach,He would want this. I'm certain of it. Though I'm also certain I'd like to wring Mizora's neck for what she's put you through.
Karlach,Your father is a legend. An honourable man who gave his life for his city. We all owe him gratitude - but you don't owe him your soul.
Karlach,"You had no other choice. That's life, sometimes. Unfair as fuck. But you didn't do this - she did. You only played the hand you were dealt."
Karlach,"Duke Ulder Ravengard would want what was best for his son. I know you two had your differences, but he loved you. He wouldn't change a thing."
Karlach,Minsc just joined our team. This is the best day of my life.
Karlach,"It's over, darling. You're free. Now you can start processing everything that's happened - believe me, it's plenty."
Karlach,"Swit swoo, woman! Never thought I'd be so delighted at the sight of a forehead. You look amazing!"
Karlach,Gods! So much for our cure. That thing almost popped you like a watermelon.
Karlach,These are real hellish gems. Some of Minauros' hoard.
Karlach,The search continues and continues.
Karlach,"Gortash's dad. Same treatment as his mum, I guess."
Karlach,Minsc is so amazing.
Karlach,Damn. It can't have been easy for Lae'zel to stand up to Vlaakith like that. But there's nothing that woman can't do.
Karlach,"We've worn Ketheric down, but the cadaver still has some life in him. Down the tentacle hole we go."
Karlach,"You know, for a while there, I thought Shadowheart was going to stay stuck in Sharville. Maybe become the duke of the place."
Karlach,"But she's done what so few are able for. She's created her own path. And now she's got her folks back, too. I love to see it."
Karlach,"This is real. A Death Devil skull, by my reckoning."
Karlach,"All the more reason to put this place to rights. Give Little Minthy every chance of a normal life. And hey - if you're in the market for godmothers, I have availability from now 'til the rest of my life."
Karlach,"Minthara's pregnant. A new life, a little one, sprung from all this fuckin' chaos."
Karlach,Let's poke around the rat's nest. Maybe set it on fire on the way out.<br>
Karlach,"Soldier, my heart feels like a live grenade - gonna blow any minute. You still have a life to live. I don't."
Karlach,"You're very fucking welcome, soldier."
Karlach,"If anyone was gonna be able to pull off a few tentacles, it was going to be me. Let's do this."
Karlach,"I won't have to look at you much longer anyway, so I'm really getting the good end of the deal."
Karlach,"I trust you. Do what you think is right, and I'll stand by you."
Karlach,"But if you change your mind, just say so. I'm here. And I'm ready for whatever comes next."
Karlach,"I've never been more sure of anything. This heart inside me is about to blow. Doesn't matter which body it takes out with it, right?"
Karlach,"Thank you, darling."
Karlach,That bloody freak won't get away with this. We're going to hunt her down and take Yenna back. Mark my words.
Karlach,Wow. 'Chosen of Mystra.' I guess I should congratulate Gale. Right?
Karlach,It sounded like Gale really meant it. He really wants to take control of the Karsite Weave.
Karlach,He really wants to be a god.
Karlach,Can you believe this is my first time in the Underdark? The world is so big.
Karlach,Alfira's dead. And whoever did kill her will pay for it. Got it?
Karlach,That bloody shapeshifting freak! No one takes my githyanki and gets away with it.
Karlach,"Aw, was that Gale's granddad?"
Karlach,"You've really done it now, Shadowheart. I hope you know what the fuck you're getting yourself into."
Karlach,"That name rings a bell. Halsin mentioned a Thaniel, right? Part of his 'spirit of the land' mission."
Karlach,I trust him to know what he's doing. To know how far to go for Mystra. I just hope he knows he doesn't need her favour to be fucking fantastic.
Karlach,We have a lot to think about. Let's do it far away from this place.
Karlach,"Very glad mysteria and the githyanki settled things without letting any blood. While I would've enjoyed the spectacle, I wouldn't have liked to lose either one just yet."
Karlach,"Feels like we're walking into a trap. Hope you know what you're doing, Lae."
Karlach,"Very glad Shadowheart and Lae'zel settled things without letting any blood. I would've enjoyed the spectacle, but not losing either one of those lunatics."
Karlach,"He'd hate to hear me say this, but I'm so fucking proud of Astarion. He could've had it all, but he kept his soul instead."
Karlach,"Wasn't sure he had it in him, but he's changed so much. Overcome so much darkness. Ooh, I could smooch that pointy little face!"
Karlach,I can feel it. So much infernal machinery - and magic - at work here.
Karlach,Gortash must've done some dark shit to get his hands on all these creepy contraptions.
Karlach,His mind was all addled - like a bog standard True Soul. But... he could've been brought round. Couldn't he?
Karlach,"We should've been more careful. Knocked him out, you know? The Astral Prism might've brought him round, same as it did for us."
Karlach,Dammit. What a mess.
Karlach,"She can teach me how to slice, and I'll teach her how to bash."
Karlach,"But... argh! I wish we could've held back a little. Knocked him out, seen if the Astral Prism would've brought him round."
Karlach,"Not in the habit of arguing with gods, but I'm not sure what to do. Whatever might be 'corrupted' about the Prism, it's helped us thus far."
Karlach,Not sure I trust the gith queen not to crush us once we've done what she asks.
Karlach,And I thought I knew what hell was...
Karlach,"Gods, when this is over, I'm taking the hottest bath known to man or devil."
Karlach,"Wow, Gale. 'Chosen of Mystra.' Congratulations, I think?"
Karlach,"'Chosen of Karlach' has a ring to it, right?"
Karlach,"I'll admit it, I was saying my prayers there. Thank the gods we made it out of Gortash's hellhole."
Karlach,"This is grim. If we can slip this without murdering a hollyphant, I'll be very glad."
Karlach,"Minsc was a hero. He deserved a hero's death. Not this. We'll avenge him. The Dead Three did this, really. And we're going to stop their fucked up plan in its tracks."
Karlach,Thought this place was going to blow. We'll live to fight another day.
Karlach,I bet Lae'zel is absolutely lethal with that sword.
Karlach,"I couldn't help overhearing. So Mystra wants to talk, does she? Not every day a god asks for a chat."
Karlach,Are you all right? Of course you're not all right.
Karlach,"Look, I've got you. If you need a rest, lean on me. If you need a hand, take mine. If you need an ear, I've got two. Whatever you need."
Karlach,"Damn, Shadowheart. I admit I'm impressed you beat a githyanki warrior, but I wish it didn't come to this."
Karlach,"Well, Astarion. I stood by you and defeated the last obstacle to your reign as the vampire lord of Baldur's Gate."
Karlach,Something tells me I might regret this. I'm counting on you to prove me wrong.
Karlach,"Just when I think I can't respect Jaheira any more, she hits me with a grenade right to the heart."
Karlach,I couldn't agree with her more. There's more to life than... than time. It isn't about how long you're here. It's about what you do with whatever time you've got.
Karlach,"And Jaheira? Well, I don't think anyone's spent their hours better than her."
Karlach,...can I come?
Karlach,Interesting.
Karlach,"As for us... well, we can stick together until the city is well and truly saved. After that... we'll see."
Karlach,I hope he still sees it that way. Something tells me he's not the same person we knew. Not anymore.
Karlach,No. I mean - maybe. I don't know. I'm not sure what he's capable of now that he's so... changed.
Karlach,Time will tell. But I'm keeping an eye out.
Karlach,"Me either. Luckily, vampires - even vampire lords - aren't as hard to kill as they may seem."
Karlach,"I hope it won't come to that. But if it does, I'm ready."
Karlach,"I hope Zevlor rests in the softest, sweetest peace possible. He deserved more than he got."
Karlach,The Blade of Avernus. I can't think of a better man than Wyll to take up the title. It's about time someone stood up to the evil fucks populating the Hells.
Karlach,"So we're knocking around with a vampire lord, now. We sure this is a good idea?"
Karlach,"Wonder if Jaheira ever hangs around the Outer City. Maybe after this is over, I could buy her a drink. Does she drink? She likes wine. Wine then. This is all happening so fast!"
Karlach,I'll hog-tie him and force him to get this tadpole out if it's the last thing he does.
Karlach,"He's not infernal, at least. But there's something else about him. Let's hope whatever's going on under that impressive mop is good news."
Karlach,It's done. Shadowheart's gone. We did the right thing - right?
Karlach,Barcus has the right idea. We've got to get to Moonrise too - and soon.
Karlach,Did you hear that? The poor evil cultist needs our help.
Karlach,You better not be planning on giving her up. Not after everything she's been through.
Karlach,I guess so. I guess it all makes sense. But it doesn't feel right.
Karlach,"That's what I can't get out of my head. Whatever she is, whatever she's done, she deserves... I don't know. Not to be tormented by zealots."
Karlach,"Whether we should or shouldn't, I'm gonna. Shadowheart was my friend. Or at least, I wanted her to be. I liked that little ball of points. "
Karlach,"That doesn't make me feel better. In fact, it makes me want to vomit."
Karlach,Dame Aylin is going to want to kick this guy's arse herself. Believe me.
Karlach,"Did you hear what he said? The hammer's in his House of Hope. If we wanted, we could steal it right out from under his nose."
Karlach,We would need to find a diabolist. One worth their salt should be able to get us into that devil's lair.
Karlach,"One last trip to Avernus. At least it'd be for a good reason, right?"
Karlach,Hey - what's wrong? You look spooked.
Karlach,"'Mind your own damn business, I'm busy inserting my head into my arse.'"
Karlach,And I'm the queen of Baldur's Gate. But all right - let's move.
Karlach,"If you say so, soldier. Might want to start learning to swing a sword. Stay behind me until then - I'll crack anyone who messes with you."
Karlach,"Until then, let me lead the way. Anything pops out from under a mushroom, and I'll make sure it doesn't grab my poor powerless pal."
Karlach,"I need you to finish what we started. I need you to remember me - our mission - long enough for that. If you try anything else, I'll kill you. Understand?"
Karlach,"Gods. You've really done it now, haven't you."
Karlach,"Exactly. And anyway, he'll see this is a losing gambit eventually. Maybe take up something more interesting, like darts."
Karlach,"For now, she's bigger than it is. But things grow when you feed 'em. That's all."
Karlach,Shadowheart's really done it now. She's crossed a line she can never un-cross.
Karlach,Feels like we're walking into a trap.
Karlach,This merits a celebration. You did what you had to do to get yourself right - to choose the life you wanted to live.
Karlach,"Very fuckin proud of you, mate. Seriously."
Karlach,All this magical hoo-ha. Gale would love it here.
Karlach,"Very fuckin proud of you, darling. Seriously."
Karlach,Another visit from the golden paladin. It said we'll get the answers we need about the tadpole if we infiltrate the cult.
Karlach,It's a fair point. I just don't want to take a short-term boon. I want to win this whole thing. To finish off the cult. To get this tadpole out. To stay sane the whole time.
Karlach,It's the bloody Underdark. Never know what mad shit you're gonna run into down here.
Karlach,Could be. But I'm not sure either. And I'd rather rely on our wits and our weapons than a tadpole that could be up to anything in there.
Karlach,I say we don't let Aylin anywhere near this guy. It won't do either of them any good.
Karlach,She can handle whatever that prick throws at her. Eventually he'll get bored. Maybe even move on to something more productive.
Karlach,Is that wishful thinking?
Karlach,"Fair enough. I only wish she'd have a bit of peace, after all the shit she's been through."
Karlach,"You know, I'm getting really tired of big-headed fools and their godsdamned schemes. Don't they ever go on holiday?"
Karlach,But fair enough. It's Dame Aylin's decision how she wants to deal with Lorroakan. I just wish she'd have a bit of peace after all she's been through.
Karlach,My thinking exactly. This weasel's got nothing on our demi-god. Nothing at all.
Karlach,"I guess that's her right. I've no doubt she can handle him. I just... well, there's a darkness in her. A pain I recognise."
Karlach,That guy's a walking wound. He thinks Dame Aylin will fix whatever's broken in him. And he'll good as kill her to do it.
Karlach,"We'd need to talk to Helsik. She'd know how to get into that devil's lair, if she's worth her salt."
Karlach,"Maybe not. I wouldn't exactly relish heading into a devil's lair looking for it. But if you think it'll help us stop the Netherbain, I'll do anything."
Karlach,"Believe me, I don't relish the thought either. But we need to assess all our options. What matters most is defeating the brain and saving the city."
Karlach,"Shadowheart looks so happy, doesn't she? She seems... found. In a way she never seemed before, even when she was most devoted to Shar."
Karlach,Her folks must be so glad to have her back. And to see who she's become.
Karlach,"I like Gale, but I'm keeping all my good gear well out of sight."
Karlach,Everything fancy he touches meets a grisly end.
Karlach,"I commiserate with his situation, though. It's tough ticks housing something you can't control."
Karlach,"Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard. Has a ring to it, doesn't it? It sounds like... like a fate you earned."
Karlach,"I can't think of a better caretaker for the city I love. You're going to do so much for Baldur's Gate, Wyll."
Karlach,"Goblin parties are so much more fun than anything you'll find in Baldur's Gate. Or the Hells, for that matter."
Karlach,Lae'zel. Vlaakith spoke your name. She knows exactly who you are. And you stood up to her.
Karlach,"Not that I'm suggesting we stop for a drink, of course."
Karlach,"Oh, Shadowheart. You may not remember what you've done. But I do."
Karlach,It sounded like you really meant it. You really want to take control of the Karsite Weave.
Karlach,You really want to be a god.
Karlach,Interesting. I'll keep that in mind.
Karlach,I've underestimated her. Won't make that mistake again.
Karlach,"I made it back. I'm here. Thank the gods, thank the gods."
Karlach,And I thought I'd heard it all. That's some cambion-level deception.
Karlach,"We're going to keep you safe, Astarion. On my life, Cazador won't touch you."
Karlach,"I'm speechless. A Bhaalist among us like this. If we didn't need the fucker, I'd say we run for the hills."
Karlach,Feeling illithid?
Karlach,"Can you feel it? This is the Lord of Murder's domain. If we can survive this, we'll have really stuck it to him."
Karlach,Hm? Did you... are you talking to me?
Karlach,"If we can do that without heisting in the Hells, believe me, I'm all for it."
Karlach,"You have to stay strong. You have to resist. If you don't, we're all doomed."
Karlach,You're mad. My gods.
Karlach,Be careful what you wish for.
Karlach,"Hey, Shads. I know you've just heard a lot of pretty shocking stuff. I can't pretend to know how you're feeling, but I want you to know I'm beside you."
Karlach,This place is done for. Let's get out of here.
Karlach,"Shapeshifters in the Harpers. My dad always admired their mission - said they gave up their entire lives so we could live safely, and asked for nothing in return. We'll rout them, right? For the city - and for dad."
Karlach,"I recognise some of these people. They had the grit to get out of one hell, only to stumble into another."
Karlach,"Gods, Shadowheart looks like a stack of gold! Never thought I could get so excited about someone's forehead, but here we are."
Karlach,Some people have all the luck.
Karlach,Your queen ought to be proud of you.
Karlach,Lae'zel. Vlaakith spoke your name. She knows exactly who you are.
Karlach,Do what you came here to do. I've got your back.
Karlach,Minsc is working for the cult? Damn. He must've been tadpoled - or worse. The real Minsc would never join up with the godsdamned Absolute.
Karlach,"Maybe we can help him - the Prism, right? It should shut that tadpole up - if he doesn't kick our butts first. It's kind of his thing."
Karlach,"Thanks to Shadowheart's good sense, we've got a chance at beating him."
Karlach,Fucking shapeshifter. She'll try to break our best asset: Our trust. Fortunately she's no match for our second-best asset: me.
Karlach,I kinda like that mouldy water smell.
Karlach,"Kith'rak Voss didn't know who he was dealing with, did he? Throw salt on Vlaakith's name in front of Lae'zel of Crèche K'liir, and you're gonna get a hard spanking."
Karlach,I've got my eye on that rogue. For a few reasons.
Karlach,"Lae'zel, you know I admire that faithful heart of yours. But sometimes, being loyal to the wrong person can come back to bite you - hard. I hope this isn't one of those times."
Karlach,That contraption's a hot ticket item. Might not be our last scrap for its sake.
Karlach,"Erm, I think we weren't supposed to touch anything... right?<br>"
Karlach,Might be better to leave it alone. No sense tempting trouble.
Karlach,"You sure about that, soldier? Seems risky.<br>"
Karlach,Hm. And now you have to consume gear Karlach really wants because...
Karlach,"Well, shit. And I thought I had it bad."
Karlach,"That's a tough hand, Gale. But I'm glad you told me. A chest-bomb shared is a chest-bomb halved, or whatever."
Karlach,"If I spot anything that'll help, I'll hand it right over, pal. We're in this together."
Karlach,"Are we talking some kind of were-wizard situation here, or...?"
Karlach,"Wizards and their secrets. Buddy, I could ruin that mind of yours with the stories I could tell. Nothing you say could scare me. When you're ready to talk, I'm ready to listen."
Karlach,I'd mind less if I knew the full story. Never seen a fellow suck the magic-marrow out of an item before.
Karlach,Looks like we're done here. Pity. This place has been a wild ride.
Karlach,"Careful, soldier. Never forget Raphael has one thing in mind: Himself. Always."
Karlach,"Mizora. I'd take anything she says with a grain of salt. But with her claws as deep in our business as they are, I guess we can't ignore her completely."
Karlach,Shadowheart's a funny frog. I like her fringe though. Very blunt.
Karlach,"What is it about this place? I know we shouldn't let down our guard, but I feel... like I could drift off and never wake up."
Karlach,"Look at you, soldier! Are my eyes lying, or is there a bit of colour in those cheeks?"
Karlach,"Whatever you're doing, keep it up."
Karlach,Me? Never been better.
Karlach,"Hey now, what happened to that fancy bit of gear?"
Karlach,I was really worried for a moment there. Thought we'd lost one of our own to forces beyond imagining. I'm so glad I was wrong.
Karlach,I'm going to miss Shadowheart. She was all right.
Karlach,"Wow. So Gale really talked to Mystra, huh?"
Karlach,"This can't be right. That things going to kill you - move, now!"
Karlach,There's got to be some way to stop this thing!
Karlach,Never stick your head in an extraplanar torture device. A rule to live by.
Karlach,"Pretty spectacular stuff. But he's right not to do her bidding, no questions asked."
Karlach,"Wish I could say I was surprised about Cazador's pact. Where blood, death, and betrayal parade, you can bet your arse a devil is riding grand marshal."
Karlach,"Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard. Has a ring to it, doesn't it? I can't think of a better caretaker for the Gate."
Karlach,"Poor Shadowheart. She's been jerked around so much. I want to believe the gods keep this world balanced, but sometimes... sometimes I wonder."
Karlach,"Gods, she's gonna rip our legs off."
Karlach,"You're glowing. Finally, you have answers. Finally, you're free. Shar may still have access to you, but you're your own woman."
Karlach,I had a wild dream last night. This beautiful entity came to me; promised to protect me. Told me the parasite in our heads could give us power.
Karlach,Sounds like it. What did you make of it?
Karlach,Damn right. Thing's like a splinter - we just need to find a way to squeeze it out.
Karlach,"Yeah. Right. I hope so, anyway."
Karlach,"Seems risky if you ask me. Couldn't help getting stuck with the tadpole, but taking favours from it? Spooky."
Karlach,"Anyway, I told the entity to make tracks. I don't need anything else from this tadpole, thanks very much."
Karlach,"Have it your way, soldier."
Karlach,"Phew. Thought you and the walking fringe were gonna come to blows. You would've wiped the floor with her, but I'm glad you decided not to. I like having both of you around."
Karlach,"Your folks are absolutely precious, by the way. They must be so happy to have you back."
Karlach,Hey - wait! That's the only thing keeping us from transforming!
Karlach,"Ugh, that guy makes my skin crawl. So - what's the plan? Do we chase him out of town, or skip straight to skull-cracking?"
Karlach,"All right,  all right, fair enough. But ooh, can I watch?"
Karlach,What's he going to do?
Karlach,Good. I'm one hundred percent sure there's another way to bring down this cult. No true god would ask such a thing from her faithful. That's for certain.
Karlach,"Poor Gale. He must be in bits after hearing that. I'll distract him. Tell him I haven't read a book since secondary school, watch his face melt off."
Karlach,"Well, tell him to pick the right one. Better yet, I'll do it. Fucking wizards, man! They always need help picking the simple, obvious option."
Karlach,You can't be seriously considering this. You're better than this. Aren't you?
Karlach,"If Mystra can't think of another way to stop the Absolute than sacrificing Gale, she's no god worth worshipping. I'll say that to Gale - in, you know, gentle terms."
Karlach,She what?! Is she mad?!
Karlach,"Hang on - you're not seriously considering this, are you?"
Karlach,"Whoa, now. He's got a... well, I guess that would explain a little, but... Mystra... I mean, this is a lot to take in."
Karlach,"Karlach doesn't worry, she acts. So if Gale needs me, now's the time to tell me."
Karlach,Why'd he come all this way to track us down?
Karlach,"Aye aye, soldier."
Karlach,Well. We stood by Astarion and defeated the last obstacle to his reign as the vampire lord of Baldur's Gate.
Karlach,Sometimes I really question my own decision-making.
Karlach,Just when I think I can't respect Jaheira any more. She's got a backup plan for if we fuck things up. Smart.
Karlach,I say we march in there and give the little shits what they want.
Karlach,"This better be a long con, soldier."
Karlach,Let's hope she doesn't need to use it. Not everyone wants to live forever.
Karlach,Wonder if he's a wizard too. He's certainly got the beardliness for it.
Karlach,We're in the belly of the beast now. Try not to do anything too heroic.
Karlach,"Huh. Doesn't ring a bell. But all right! Must've had something important to say to Gale, if he came all this way. Good news, I hope."
Karlach,The elder brain can control anyone with a tadpole. That's... concerning.
Karlach,I'm not bloodthirsty. I'm dangerous creep-thirsty. This guy is terrible news. I say we stop him before he hurts anyone.
Karlach,Better yet: Let Dame Aylin do it. She deserves to look him in the eye before she ends him.
Karlach,"Says you. Me, I'd love nothing more than to throat slam that creep."
Karlach,Halsin is one hench elf. I'm impressed - and glad he's on our side.
Karlach,"It's... beautiful. Gods, what a sight.<br>"
Karlach,Can't believe what I'm seeing. This place is beautiful. 
Karlach,"Pity about Halsin. I was getting used to having an extra Strong around. He smelled nice, too. Like outside."
Karlach,"Wow, so that was Mystra. Pretty spectacular stuff. But I think Gale was right not to agree to do her bidding, no questions asked."
Karlach,You've done the same for me. Who would've thought a vampire and a hellspawn could go so far together?
Karlach,"Proud of Gale, though. It takes some man to hold his own in front of the divine."
Karlach,Maybe. Maybe not. But it is what it is. I'll stand by you until our mission is done - but I may not stick around long enough to see what you do with all this new power.
Karlach,"Wield your new power well. I have a real thing for stopping evil in its tracks these days. And unlike you, I'm not afraid to die."
Karlach,"Go on, soldier. If anything goes wrong, I'll come in swinging."
Karlach,"Go fuck yourself, Astarion."
Karlach,"You'll hate this, but... I'm so fucking proud of you."
Karlach,You could've had it all - but it would've cost you your soul. You kept what was worth keeping. That can't have been easy.
Karlach,No promises. You deserve to be told and told again what an incredible person you are.
Karlach,Give it time. Soon you'll start to see yourself how I see you: A man of integrity. Honour. And other words you absolutely detest.
Karlach,And? Is it everything you hoped it would be?
Karlach,Got no use for lies. Life's interesting enough on its own.
Karlach,No surrender.
Karlach,"I never killed anyone that didn't deserve it. Devils, demons, and the fiends that serve 'em - no mercy."
Karlach,Everthing's going dark.
Karlach,Help me...
Karlach,Not yet... please.<br>
Karlach,Oh no...
Karlach,Heal me... please...
Karlach,No! I won't go!
Karlach,Shouldn't be too hard.
Karlach,Can't I just break it.
Karlach,Fiddly things.
Karlach,C'mon...
Karlach,To the left and...
Karlach,Almost...
Karlach,Let me take a look at that.
Karlach,You're not looking well.
Karlach,I can put you to rights.
Karlach,This isn't the way.
Karlach,I'm burnt out!
Karlach,Yoink.
Karlach,And?
Karlach,Scarlet.
Karlach,Get down!
Karlach,They won't spot me now.
Karlach,Quiet as silence.
Karlach,Can't see me.
Karlach,Don't look!
Karlach,Slick.
Karlach,Poor thing - let me help.
Karlach,Shht!
Karlach,Invisible.
Karlach,Born for this.
Karlach,Boom! Here I go.
Karlach,Hello?
Karlach,Yo!
Karlach,Lookie.
Karlach,Aha!
Karlach,Here I go...
Karlach,"Let's fix you up, my love."
Karlach,Should do...
Karlach,Hup to.
Karlach,Gimme.
Karlach,Surprise!<br>
Karlach,I need to talk.
Karlach,Listen up.
Karlach,I'm butting in.
Karlach,"You've got time, right?"
Karlach,Hi.
Karlach,Huh.
Karlach,Prick up your ears.
Karlach,Team!
Karlach,I know what you need.
Karlach,You but better!
Karlach,"Nice, right?"
Karlach,Go on!
Karlach,"Hold still, soldier!"
Karlach,"Hey, catch this!"
Karlach,"Here you go, soldier!"
Karlach,Heads up.
Karlach,For me?
Karlach,"Toes, toes."
Karlach,Marching.
Karlach,There we go.
Karlach,What next?
Karlach,Lalala.<br>
Karlach,Let's go!<br>
Karlach,Heyy.
Karlach,Uh huh.
Karlach,Ooh!
Karlach,Phew!
Karlach,Where to?
Karlach,Let's ride.
Karlach,Saddle up.
Karlach,Honk honk.
Karlach,Yeah-ha.
Karlach,Me?
Karlach,While I'm at it.
Karlach,Movin' it.
Karlach,"I've got you, soldier!"
Karlach,Move it.
Karlach,Stop that.
Karlach,Hey you.
Karlach,Got a little time?
Karlach,Can we chat?
Karlach,Hey there.
Karlach,"Gods, you're cute."
Karlach,"Got time for me, darling?"
Karlach,Mind if I get closer?
Karlach,Hey darling.
Karlach,Ugh. If I have to.
Karlach,All right. I think I can do this. Time to... keep going.
Karlach,"Protect the city I love, I guess."
Karlach,"The 'Absolute' can have Baldur's Gate when I'm dead. Which may be in the next few minutes, but until then, no."
Karlach,"I'm going back to camp. If I don't immolate in the night, I'll deal with this sorry shit tomorrow."
Karlach,I don't feel like I've won. All I feel is tired.
Karlach,Am I fucking missing something?
Karlach,Here goes.
Karlach,All right!
Karlach,Let me at it.
Karlach,Together!
Karlach,Happy?
Karlach,"Come on, soldier."
Karlach,Oh no!
Karlach,Rally!
Karlach,C'mon.
Karlach,Steady on.
Karlach,This'll cure you.
Karlach,"He's dead, and he's no fucking sorrier now than he was before."
Karlach,Here comes Mama Karlach.
Karlach,"Come on, soldier.<br>"
Karlach,No time for that.
Karlach,Knock knock.
Karlach,You napping?
Karlach,You alive?
Karlach,None left behind.
Karlach,Ready for more?
Karlach,Hang on.
Karlach,"Don't say that. Say you found some way to fix me. That now Gortash is dead, I'll get my heart back."
Karlach,"And you - you'll just keep going, won't you. Watching the stars. Warming your hands on the campfire. Dancing, eating, making fucking love all night - all of it, all of it."
Karlach,It isn't fair. I don't want it like this.
Karlach,Free now?
Karlach,I've got this.
Karlach,Let me do it.
Karlach,Don't move.
Karlach,No time for that.<br>
Karlach,Tasty.
Karlach,Does this help?
Karlach,So stiff!
Karlach,How about now?
Karlach,I'll save you.
Karlach,Eyes on the prize - we need to win this!<br>
Karlach,Not every soldier should've made it out of training.
Karlach,"Eyes on victory, tummy on dinner."
Karlach,I ought to just burn this whole thing down.
Karlach,Enough of that.
Karlach,Done?
Karlach,Can you move?
Karlach,Go on then.
Karlach,How's this?
Karlach,I'm here.
Karlach,Sigh!
Karlach,I've got butterflies.
Karlach,Do I look all right?
Karlach,Boom!<br>
Karlach,You can do it!
Karlach,Haha!
Karlach,Victory.
Karlach,Poor love.
Karlach,Wheyy!
Karlach,Oh yeah.
Karlach,"Come on, darling."
Karlach,Are you all right?
Karlach,I have you.
Karlach,Together now.
Karlach,Let's fix this.
Karlach,Won't leave you.
Karlach,Success!
Karlach,Brace yourself.
Karlach,"Check this out, soldier!"
Karlach,We're in this together.
Karlach,Mizora serves Zariel. The Archduchess of  the Hells. Why would  you sell your soul to her?
Karlach,I ought to just end it all now. On my terms.
Karlach,But then who'd save this godforsaken town.
Karlach,You do it. I'm tired.
Karlach,Let's get out of here. I've always hated this place. Stupid fucking gigantic bridge or whatever.
Karlach,"I think I need to go to camp for a while. Be alone. Scream at the sky. You can come and find me later, if you want to."
Karlach,Thanks for listening. For existing. Love you.
Karlach,"You might only find a pile of ash, but I'll be there all the same."
Karlach,I don't know how.
Karlach,Are the gods really listening?
Karlach,You better be right or I'll haunt your arse.
Karlach,Not exactly encouraging. But I'll take what I can get.
Karlach,I guess I'm not the only one bound by something beyond my control.
Karlach,That's a big ask. You in good with the powers that be?
Karlach,Well then. Maybe I have a chance after all.
Karlach,An actual hero. One of the few.
Karlach,"No, Wyll. Not you. I won't let that happen. Not ever."
Karlach,You could try. Haven't you got a Wish spell in that pack of yours?
Karlach,Hells yes.
Karlach,"Gods, you're cute.<br>"
Karlach,My back can't take much more of this.
Karlach,"Not now, I'm being a sneak!"
Karlach,I'm getting too old for this nonsense.
Karlach,I'm not built to crouch.
Karlach,NOTE TO ACTOR/DIRECTOR: Blow a raspberry at the player.
Karlach,Don't. Poke. The Karlach.
Karlach,"Thanks for not giving up on me, either."
Karlach,Who am I?
Karlach,I've got you.<br>
Karlach,"Let's fix you up, my love.<br>"
Karlach,Hngh...
Karlach,Good thievin'.
Karlach,Yeah!
Karlach,Fingerly.
Karlach,Monster.
Karlach,My eye!
Karlach,I should've yoked my fate to a better cleric.
Karlach,Worth a shot.
Karlach,"I begged one of them to claim my soul. Hoping for Lathander or Selûne, but at this point I've probably done more to earn Loviatar's interest."
Karlach,Ravengard. He's been a legend since I was a wee one. No one loves Baldur's Gate more than him.
Karlach,"All right, who's acting the clown?"
Karlach,Ah! What was that?
Karlach,What a lovely occasion this is.
Karlach,Though I'm going to get very hungry very soon.
Karlach,I could eat a beholder - what's cooking?
Karlach,No doubt about it - engine's cooking hotter here. Damn.
Karlach,Something's off about this one. On your guard.
Karlach,The fact that we're both still standing here unscathed means he's a friend. Or something close to it.
Karlach,"You make it sound like a harvester devil's coming for you, Wyll."
Karlach,"I would too. Go on, Wyll - we're listening. Who sicced you on me?"
Karlach,You make it sound like a harvester devil's coming for your throat.
Karlach,Go on. We're listening.
Karlach,"So. Wyll. Now that we've made peace, how about we get to know each other properly. What's your story?"
Karlach,Mustn't think about any of the local brains. Far too tempting.
Karlach,"Ah, a pity mutton chops no longer hold any temptation."
Karlach,Gut him? I'd rather toast him. He could've gone for my throat.
Karlach,Hey you.<br>
Karlach,You definitely didn't.
Karlach,There it is. Of course.
Karlach,It's evil. I was so young when this fucker betrayed me. So naive. They stole my heart before I even knew what I had.
Karlach,Got a miracle in your back pocket you forgot to tell me about?
Karlach,Feel like I should laugh but I'm just too godsdamned tired.
Karlach,"But there's nothing, is there? I killed the bastard who ruined my life, and my prize is that I get to crawl into a corner and die."
Karlach,Hang on. What the fuck is going on here?
Karlach,I'm sure it is.
Karlach,"'Let's be allies,' said the viper to the frog."
Karlach,What?! You can't be serious.
Karlach,This isn't going to end well. Mark my words.
Karlach,Too right.
Karlach,"If there was ever a moment to kill this fucker, this is it."
Karlach,Ravengard - the real Ravengard - is in there somewhere. We can't give up on him.
Karlach,"Ah, come on. What's with you? We have room. Kid needs us."
Karlach,"Ye gods, this guy is begging to get smacked."
Karlach,Are you sure about this?
Karlach,Huh. What's the catch.
Karlach,The machines might be scrap. But that doesn't mean we've got the advantage.
Karlach,Let me help you!
Karlach,Here I am.
Karlach,Mind if I butt in?
Karlach,Done?<br>
Karlach,Stealth mode: activated.
Karlach,Like a vandal.
Karlach,Let's turn down the fire.
Karlach,Shadows don't suit me.
Karlach,Time for a soft touch.
Karlach,You can't see me.
Karlach,Invisible me.
Karlach,I feel like a rothé in a tea shop.
Karlach,Not used to lying low.
Karlach,I'm too tall for this...<br>
Karlach,Halfling essence...
Karlach,Long n' low.
Karlach,Rat feet.
Karlach,Sneak sneak.
Karlach,Handy.
Karlach,"Good idea, Karlach."
Karlach,Easy as.
Karlach,My little trick.
Karlach,Heya!
Karlach,Scuse me.
Karlach,"A word, please."
Karlach,I'll help you
Karlach,Stuck no more.
Karlach,Heave ho!
Karlach,Be free!
Karlach,Quiet.
Karlach,I've got you. 
Karlach,Ready?
Karlach,"Up, love."
Karlach,That's it.
Karlach,All better now.
Karlach,"One, two."
Karlach,Hup.
Karlach,Ought to do it.
Karlach,Not without you.
Karlach,Shadowlach
Karlach,I'm nothing!
Karlach,Light as air
Karlach,Easy as.<br>
Karlach,Ready for round two?
Karlach,This should help.<br>
Karlach,Making me sweat.
Karlach,"Well, well, well."
Karlach,La-da-da-da...
Karlach,Hey-ho.
Karlach,Dum-dee-dum.
Karlach,I'll help you.
Karlach,Let me.
Karlach,Hngh...<br><br>
Karlach,That should do it.
Karlach,I'm here.<br>
Karlach,How's that?<br>
Karlach,Move your feet!
Karlach,Can I get a minute?
Karlach,Let's get you out.
Karlach,Got time for ol' Karlach?
Karlach,"Well, well."
Karlach,Don't burn yourself.
Karlach,Turn down the fire.
Karlach,Whisper mode.
Karlach,Handy.<br>
Karlach,Get you moving.
Karlach,Let's march!
Karlach,What a charmer.
Karlach,"Hey, good-looking."
Karlach,Attention!
Karlach,"C'mon, let's go!"
Karlach,"Damn, it's good to be alive."
Karlach,Ready for some good news.
Karlach,"I'd love to, thanks."
Karlach,You're making me sweat.
Karlach,Wanna dance?
Karlach,What's cooking?
Karlach,Don't be shy.
Karlach,I could go for a good meal.
Karlach,Lucky you.
Karlach,Soak it up.
Karlach,Potiony.
Karlach,"No sudden movements, or you're dead."
Karlach,"Haven't tangled with a gith before, but I hear you're tough. And disciplined. So let's make this quick."
Karlach,"Given how soft you look, I figure you spit fire and crap lightning, so no sudden movements."
Karlach,"Shifty fucker like you doesn't get a second warning, so no sudden movements."
Karlach,"Hold up. One more step, and I put a bolt through your eye."
Karlach,And you believe them? Those bastards are trying to feed you a crock of shit.
Karlach,I don't belong in hell any more than you do. But I was there.
Karlach,"If you killed them, I'm guessing you didn't buy their bullshit."
Karlach,Oh. Sorry I told you to piss off just now. Come on over here - we should talk.
Karlach,Anyhow. Piss off.
Karlach,Could have sworn I told you to piss off. Maybe I imagined it.<br>
Karlach,"Why the change of heart? Ah, doesn't matter - thank you."
Karlach,"Piss off, you little vulture. I'm not dead yet."
Karlach,The fallen angel... Zariel...
Karlach,Hiding... running... hunted...
Karlach,You looking for me?
Karlach,"Hurt or not, I won't miss - lung, heart, arse or eye. Take your pick."
Karlach,Tell me what you're doing here. Now.
Karlach,"Somebody fed you a crock of shit, and you swallowed the lot."
Karlach,I boarded in Avernus - that ship was my way out.
Karlach,Poor bastards.
Karlach,I didn't think anyone else had survived.
Karlach,"Hold on a minute - you were on that ship? With the tentacles, and the worms?"
Karlach,Now tell me what you just did to me before I make sure you can never do it again.
Karlach,That was one of my good days - the bad ones would knock you sick.
Karlach,Do you find this funny?
Karlach,Lies... she hunts me... won't let me go...
Karlach,Really? You're serious?
Karlach,Truth's not quite so exciting. Come on over and I'll tell you the whole story.
Karlach,"I guess they told you I bite the heads off babies, and paint myself in their blood."
Karlach,Are you demented? I'm a tiefling - same as you. More or less.
Karlach,What? You've never seen a tiefling before?
Karlach,Sure they were - and I'm Tiamat's left tit.
Karlach,I reckon you've been sold a crock of shit about me.
Karlach,"If you bite as hard as you bark, we might just get along. I'm dangerous all right, but I've got no quarrel with you. "
Karlach,"I'm a fugitive - escaped from the Hells, and those bastards are trying to take me back."
Karlach,Hunted... murdered... condemned...
Karlach,Conspiracy... Elturel's fall...
Karlach,Blood War... Avernus... champion...
Karlach,You're just jealous. I saw the way you looked at that foot.
Karlach,I have... but that's a story for another time.
Karlach,I think it's fairly obvious. And impressive.
Karlach,Come on - let's get you a beer to wash the taste away.
Karlach,Smart. You should get a few more pretty marks like mine. They're not just for show.
Karlach,Don't be so quick to judge. Every scar and sigil on my body serves a purpose - there's beauty in them.
Karlach,Oof. No. Sorry Dribbles.
Karlach,Good gods. What else can you do with that tongue?
Karlach,"Hang on now, soldier, I'm not paying for your sins."
Karlach,"Ah come on, soldier, you've been through worse - nearly."
Karlach,"Yes, yes, yes! Let's do it!"
Karlach,Hah! Absolutely. This is gonna be great fun.
Karlach,"She's the worst of the worst. I suppose a devil can't help her nature, but she's got a really godsdamn bad nature."
Karlach,You know me too well.
Karlach,Honestly - probably. But hopefully not any time soon. I've got a lot of living to do yet.
Karlach,"Kids, huh? I don't know. How about a really mean goat."
Karlach,"This had better be violent, sexy, or both."
Karlach,No - I just saw a chance and I took it. 
Karlach,Little tyrant. Teach him some manners.
Karlach,Well done. You humiliated a goblin. Let's go.
Karlach,Karlach... the Demonsbane...
Karlach,That bastard cut me deep.
Karlach,Ster'ca.
Karlach,"Another day, another scar."
Karlach,Poisoned deal. Trust me. Don't believe a word she says.
Karlach,Please! She's dreaming if she thinks we'd leave Mayrina here.
Karlach,The hag's in your head! Take that mask off - now!
Karlach,Ah! A circus! Can we go?!
Karlach,It's the mask! Get that thing off your face!
Karlach,"Nice one, Shadowheart. That thing in your pocket seems powerful as hell."
Karlach,That thing's shielding us. Incredible.
Karlach,"If we're quick about it, we can cut her throat before she calls for reinforcements."
Karlach,This is no place for a child. 
Karlach,He surrendered - leave him be.
Karlach,Did that make you feel strong? You're more pathetic than he is.
Karlach,"Ignore his spite, friend. Mercy is its own reward."
Karlach,"Shit, this doesn't seem good."
Karlach,But... I don't know. Things can change I guess. I've heard.
Karlach,That ship could have been heading for Sigil or Limbo for all I cared - anything was better than staying.
Karlach,And I'll be going straight back if those imp-fuckers catch me.
Karlach,"My advice? Stay away from the city. When I catch up with them, the streets will run red."
Karlach,"My advice? Stay away from the city. When I catch up with the fuckers who did this to me, the streets will run red."
Karlach,"I could use the company, but until I've shaken Zariel off my back, I'd only put a target on yours."
Karlach,"I'm going from one hell straight into another - home, to Baldur's Gate. I've got a score to settle."
Karlach,"Lucky you. It's the devils' tongue - infernal. Good for cursing and counting, not so good for small talk."
Karlach,And the first step is to go home - to Baldur's Gate. I've got a score to settle.
Karlach,"Oh, I'm counting on it. I'll be ready for her."
Karlach,The paladins you killed were acting on her orders - she'll send more. And worse.
Karlach,She tried to break me.
Karlach,"Zariel. Fallen lady, defiled celestial... ruler of Avernus. I was her prisoner, and her champion."
Karlach,Kwa'ad vos non petri'kar.
Karlach,For now. But... thank you.
Karlach,Did you get the bastards?
Karlach,"You just happened to stumble across me, here in the arse-end of nowhere? Bullshit."
Karlach,And I'm none of yours. So piss off.
Karlach,I'll start worrying when it gives me a reason to.
Karlach,Please tell me you come in peace. Last fucker who came through here properly blew out my candles.
Karlach,There you are. Good.
Karlach,I know what you did. All those people in the druid's grove - you slaughtered them to a man.
Karlach,For now.
Karlach,You - did? That's amazing. Join up with me; let me do you a favour in return.
Karlach,"You did me in, then brought me back. I'd be impressed if I weren't so pissed off."
Karlach,"Pretty sure I told you to fuck off, mate."
Karlach,Ready to team up?
Karlach,Changed your mind about teaming up?
Karlach,Thank the gods for you. I thought I was done there. You did me a big favour. I won't forget it.
Karlach,"Piss off, or show me what you're made of."
Karlach,I know the feeling. So come on - let's see whose is worse.
Karlach,That might be true. And all your power and strength is going to lead you right where you belong. The Hells.
Karlach,"True. I don't need you to speak. There's nothing you can say for yourself, anyway."
Karlach,Argh! I've got enough to worry about without your screams giving my position away.
Karlach,You're right. Violence won't change the past. But the right kind of violence can protect the future. You're dangerous. I can't let you leave.
Karlach,"Hahaha! Gods, you're pathetic when you lie. Come on - time to pay for you did. I hope it was worth it."
Karlach,"That's a load of shit. But you know what? Today, I have other priorities."
Karlach,"The last person you're ever going to meet. Karlach's my name. I've got a knack for killing demons and devils, and I think I found my next target."
Karlach,"It almost isn't fair, striking down a lunatic. But for someone as dangerous as you, I'll make an exception."
Karlach,Horseshit.
Karlach,I'm good at reading people - there's a knack to it -  and I'm only getting one word from you.
Karlach,You get a friend who'll put a dent in the skull of anyone who pisses you off.
Karlach,"Most souls in the Blood War are just meat for the grinder, but not me."
Karlach,"You gave me some breathing room when you killed those imp-fuckers, but more will come."
Karlach,"Ha. Even if you take me, I'll see you in hell one day. And I'll rip your godsdamned spine out."
Karlach,"A gang of cultists cornered me in an abandoned tollhouse, not far from here."
Karlach,Make 'em scream.
Karlach,Yeah. Not far from here - gang of cultists cornered me in an abandoned tollhouse. 
Karlach,You get a friend who spat in Baphomet's eye and lived to tell the tale.
Karlach,Safety in numbers? Not a bad idea.
Karlach,"Figures. I'll see you in hell one day, arsehole."
Karlach,"They cornered me in the tollhouse, just up the hill. Doubt they've gone far after the beating I gave them."
Karlach,Yeah. Can you handle it?
Karlach,I don't work for her anymore so I'm back to relying on muscle and steel - I'll be just fine.
Karlach,"Back in the Blood War, my commander gave me what I needed to get the job done. I had fire running through my veins."
Karlach,Devils don't like to lose their assets.
Karlach,Most souls in Avernus are just meat for the grinder. But not me.
Karlach,"I was a prisoner, forced to fight in the Blood War - the eternal battle between bad and worse."
Karlach,"I'd come with you just to see them bleed, but I'm too busy bleeding myself. I'll be here when you're done."
Karlach,"If you'd seen as much of hell as I have, you'd rather have a flayer's tentacles up your arse than stay."
Karlach,Sorry - I left all my soul coins in hell. 
Karlach,You're lucky I did.
Karlach,"I'm a fugitive. I escaped the Hells, and the bastards who were holding me there are trying to take me back."
Karlach,All right. Come on over here. But fair warning - you might find this hard to believe.
Karlach,"Oh, I have. The kind of battles a cub like you sees in their nightmares."
Karlach,I'm in a tight spot - might not be able to get out of it alone.
Karlach,"All right. Maybe the blood-loss is making me soft, but I'm going to trust you. For now."
Karlach,"Either piss off, or show me what you're made of. "
Karlach,Cute. I've scraped more frightening things than you off my boot.
Karlach,"But I won't forget what you did, and I hope I can pay you back down the line."
Karlach,"Hm. If you bite as hard as you bark, we might get along. I might even have a job for you.<br>"
Karlach,You can try.
Karlach,Bullshit. I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.
Karlach,You're picking the wrong side here - those bastards aren't what they claim to be.
Karlach,It's not - it's a shitting catastrophe. But at least I'm out.
Karlach,Fuck this - I'm done being reasonable.
Karlach,Yeah - with distinction.
Karlach,The place would have been crawling with cultists if I'd stuck around - and they'd have dragged us all back to Avernus.
Karlach,But if you do cut me down - I'll see you in the Hells one day and return the favour. Count on it.
Karlach,"You really know me, don't you? It's wild. In so many ways, we barely know each other. But where it counts, you're deeper in my head than that tadpole."
Karlach,"You did pretty well there, soldier. I have to say, I'm impressed."
Karlach,"Well. I think we've proven here today that we really don't know each other very well, do we? Ah well. There's time."
Karlach,Want another?<br>
Karlach,You shouldn't have tried me.
Karlach,"Nice trick, eh?"
Karlach,But then who'd save this fucking place.
Karlach,"Live, bitch. "
Karlach,This'll help.
Karlach,Catch!
Karlach,You've got this.
Karlach,For you.
Karlach,"Let's cook with fire, baby."
Karlach,Now this is my happy place.<br>
Karlach,Hup hup!
Karlach,On my word.
Karlach,I got this.
Karlach,"Bye forever, pal."
Karlach,Need a word.
Karlach,Boo!
Karlach,Karlach incoming.
Karlach,"Herman, is that you?"
Karlach,Need to learn the hard way?
Karlach,Open up.
Karlach,Down the hatch.
Karlach,"You're not gonna like this, mate."
Karlach,Cry about it.
Karlach,"Well, well. Look what we have here."
Karlach,You done?
Karlach,I'm heating up!
Karlach,The drama.
Karlach,You're fine.
Karlach,Atta boy.
Karlach,You. Up.
Karlach,You're all right.
Karlach,Lend an ear?
Karlach,Time for a natter.
Karlach,Scuse.
Karlach,Rally.
Karlach,"GODS, it's HOT in here!"
Karlach,Put 'em up.
Karlach,Hahahaha!
Karlach,I've got it.
Karlach,Count on me.
Karlach,Say you agree. Please.
Karlach,Under their noses.
Karlach,Soldier.<br>
Karlach,Incoming!
Karlach,Mine.
Karlach,Knees high.
Karlach,Shh...
Karlach,A little off the top.
Karlach,Foxy.
Karlach,Heehee.
Karlach,"Dunk it, shoot it."
Karlach,Hehehe.
Karlach,A bit extra.
Karlach,Clever alchemy.
Karlach,Don't tell.
Karlach,Poor fucker.
Karlach,Covered.
Karlach,In position!
Karlach,I smell blood.
Karlach,"All right, Karlach, it's go time."
Karlach,This is gonna feel good.
Karlach,Ready for another round?
Karlach,Let's GO!
Karlach,Watch this.
Karlach,"Here, honey."
Karlach,Jimmy on the go.
Karlach,Even better.
Karlach,Gorgeous.
Karlach,"Good team, us."
Karlach,Over there!
Karlach,Heading out.
Karlach,Find a route.
Karlach,Tactical.
Karlach,Close ranks.
Karlach,Star.
Karlach,Want another?
Karlach,Say bye-bye.
Karlach,The hammer's gonna fall.
Karlach,"Hang on. If we play this right, we might be able to stop this before it starts."
Karlach,Mmm. Delicious gruel.
Karlach,"Ah, come on. That's cold."
Karlach,"Poor thing must be terrified. Who do they think they are, keeping her away from her folks?"
Karlach,What. The. Hells.
Karlach,I've torn demons apart with my bare hands. Goblins won't be a problem.
Karlach,I wonder how she feels about trepanning.
Karlach,"That's it. You're calm, I'm calm, snake's calm.<br><br>"
Karlach,"A brother. And a sister. At the same time. Yeah - no. You do your thing, but that's not mine."
Karlach,"Upset? I guess not, as long as everyone's, you know - above board. I get the appeal in theory, but the reality makes me want to take a lye bath."
Karlach,"Have fun, soldier. Leave something left for me later, ey?"
Karlach,Degenerate.
Karlach,A cheeky win for us. The statue doesn't need to know what we did or didn't do to get here.
Karlach,Oh man. That's awful.
Karlach,All in a day's work.
Karlach,"So Gortash is nothing more than a pile of flesh, same as the rest of us."
Karlach,As the rising sun.
Karlach,I did it. I won.
Karlach,Wait! Don't spook the gods-damn snake!
Karlach,We can't abandon all these people. Right?<br><br>
Karlach,She's nice. But I'm more of a sunlight girl myself.
Karlach,Just the sound of his name makes my blood boil - probably literally. Can't stand the fucker. Ding ding.
Karlach,Excuse you! I think not. Not ever.
Karlach,"Mmm, I don't think so. Seems a little... I don't know. Just no."
Karlach,"With you? Please. That story's written in stone, and it ends with you on one side of the world and me on the other."
Karlach,Awww!
Karlach,Sounds rancid. Let's see if we can get him out of there.
Karlach,"Oh man, a soul coin? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on that..."
Karlach,"Looks like our man Halsin. Rest in peace, big guy."
Karlach,"I don't serve, and I don't rule. With or without tadpole."
Karlach,"That's what separates us from the devils, soldier. They think our greatest strength is a weakness."
Karlach,Fuck. A cambion.
Karlach,I don't like this at all.
Karlach,Please don't open the creepy book.
Karlach,We can't abandon all these people. Right?
Karlach,Excuse you.
Karlach,There goes our big lead. Damn.
Karlach,"But if they've fed you some lies about me going after innocents, that's a crock of shit."
Karlach,Why doesn't it feel like I won? Why do I just feel so godsdamn tired?
Karlach,He's nothing like me.
Karlach,I'm going to be as dead as Gortash any day now. Any moment. And what then?
Karlach,Off to the City of Judgement to waste into oblivion? Into the dirt to get eaten by maggots? Is that it for me?! Is that fucking all?!
Karlach,"And the others - they'll just keep going. Singing, dancing, loving each other, all of it, all of it, without me."
Karlach,"That's my reward for everything I suffered. That's why I survived ten years of torment. The fighting, the clawing, the loneliness, the fucking loneliness..."
Karlach,What the fuck am I supposed to do now?
Karlach,I should just end it all now. On my terms.
Karlach,You can do it.
Karlach,"Please! Fucking give it up. There's no miracle coming. There's no hope. You can die here in your home, or you can go back to being tormented in fucking Hell. Those are your two options."
Karlach,Together.
Karlach,Boom!
Karlach,What's it going to take?
Karlach,Ready for this?
Karlach,"C'mon, Karlach - show 'em who you are."
Karlach,I'm going to enjoy this.
Karlach,"Ooh, fun."
Karlach,Eat it.
Karlach,Watch this!
Karlach,"Is that it, then? I've killed the bastard who ruined my life, and now I crawl into a corner and die?"
Karlach,There's still hope. I can fix the engine. Stabilise it.
Karlach,It isn't fair. I was so young when... so naive. They stole my. Heart.
Karlach,"I'd like to keep an eye on things, thanks."
Karlach,I did whatever it took to get what I wanted. Just like he would've.
Karlach,So... what now?
Karlach,Where's my sunset to ride off into? My bard to play me off stage...?
Karlach,"Nothing's coming, is it? I killed the bastard who ruined my life, and my prize is that I get to crawl into a corner and die."
Karlach,Calm down. You must've known this was the only possible ending.
Karlach,Whoa - what  in the hells are you doing?!
Karlach,My heart. My heart. It was mine! From my mother. From mum.
Karlach,Knowing and believing aren't the same thing. Not by a long shot.
Karlach,"Since I met you, all I wanted was to be close to you."
Karlach,It makes no sense. None of it means anything.
Karlach,He... he wasn't even sorry for hurting me so fucking bad.
Karlach,I'm still dying. I'm dying. He killed me! I'm going to die!
Karlach,I'm not dead yet. Not yet. Not yet.
Karlach,For how much longer? Long enough to finish what you started? Long enough to get back your heart? Fat fucking chance.
Karlach,"I don't want to die. Please, no."
Karlach,You all right?
Karlach,There'll be no risk in the Emperor controlling me - it's the perfect solution.
Karlach,"Zariel laughed. Said she paid him well for my services. She'd wanted to test her new machine, and he said I'd be able to handle it."
Karlach,"The Emperor might be right, but we're not out of options yet."
Karlach,That body she's working on - that's Arabella's father.
Karlach,"I swear to you, on all I am, I'm not what you think."
Karlach,"Thank the gods, he sees sense! Look, Blade - Wyll - I know you love bashing evil - we have that in common. "
Karlach,Friends? I've gathered quite the collection.
Karlach,Well met. Now let's kick some arse while there's still arse to be kicked.
Karlach,"I can live with that. Besides, I enjoy winning hard cases over."
Karlach,"Touchy, touchy. But hey, I spent a decade in Avernus surrounded by imps and devils. Winning you over will be child's play."
Karlach,"You know, I could've used a few friends. Pity that won't be any of you."
Karlach,Too bad. I thought maybe you could be a friend. I could've done with one of those.
Karlach,"For fuck's sake, you must be half troll to have a skull that thick."
Karlach,YES! We need to go find Dammon. I'm going to get a hug! Soon!
Karlach,"Dammon told us to look out for this stuff, right? Let's go find him!"
Karlach,"Dammon'll be able to use this, right? I'm on my way to cooling right down."
Karlach,"Volatile stuff. If we find someone who can work with it, I might be able to make use of it. Keep your eyes peeled for an infernal mechanic."
Karlach,"First things first, I need to get this engine tuned up. Thing's powerful, but it's been feeling volatile ever since I left the Hells."
Karlach,That body - it looks like Arabella's mother.
Karlach,That body she's tending must be Arabella's father.
Karlach,That corpse she's tending must be Arabella's mother.
Karlach,"You know monsters, right? Better than anyone. Look into my eyes. Can't you see I'm not what you think?"
Karlach,Heya.
Karlach,"The Blade of Frontiers? Yeah, he's been on my tail for ages. Thought he'd seen sense by now, though."
Karlach,"Wait. No - don't. I'm not what he thinks. I'm not a devil, and I never wanted to serve Zariel."
Karlach,"We could've done good things, you and me. But if you want an enemy, you've got one."
Karlach,"Wyll's been deceived. It isn't his fault - but if you kill me, you'll never find out why."
Karlach,Thank you. Nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Karlach,"Look, I don't know why Wyll's been sent after me. He's a hero, right? Famously so. Heroes don't go around killing normal people."
Karlach,"Can't be too hard to find an infernal mechanic around here, right?"
Karlach,"Believe it or not, that's all I am. A woman from Baldur's Gate who's been away from home too long."
Karlach,Well I'll be godsdamned - the Blade of Frontiers. Thought I'd shaken you for good. That'll teach me to underestimate you.
Karlach,"Look - it's an honour to be chased by a famed hero. I'm no devil, though. Not by a long shot."
Karlach,How should I do that exactly? Carve out my soul to serve with a nice side of turnips?
Karlach,If you'd just hear me out -
Karlach,What the fuck is this loon talking about.
Karlach,Fuck. I'll never get used to that.
Karlach,"Look, whatever else it may be, the tadpole isn't a liar. I never wanted to serve Zariel, and I escaped the first chance I could. So stand down."
Karlach,See that you do. Last thing I want to have to do is fight you - you seem sound. I'm sound too. You'll see.
Karlach,"So be what indeed, my friend. So be what indeed."
Karlach,"If you have any ideas, I'm all for it. Give me all you've got."
Karlach,"And letting, say, a cambion near me would've been disastrous. I thought it best to just... keep my distance."
Karlach,That leech? Really? You'd rather have him than me?
Karlach,Whoa. What? You... want to be with Gale...?
Karlach,Since when?!
Karlach,Must be Arabella's father. Poor man. Hope he rests in peace.
Karlach,That's... Arabella's father. From the druids' grove. Poor man.
Karlach,Yeah. I had the same thought. So much has happened between then and now... maybe we just got a little caught up in it all.
Karlach,"But I'm not going anywhere. I've got plans for the future, you know. And they involve you."
Karlach,Hang on. Please tell me this isn't what I think it is.
Karlach,Go on.
Karlach,"Ooh, yes!"
Karlach,Swoon!
Karlach,Hmm!
Karlach,"All right there, mate? Yeah, you're all right."
Karlach,"Haha! Go on, give us a turn next.<br>"
Karlach,Do I smell beef?
Karlach,Lovely.
Karlach,I was hoping you'd say that.
Karlach,What's the story?
Karlach,I love Wyll. You know that. But I love you too. How is this possible?
Karlach,"Oh, I'm so happy for you both. Can't wait for the wedding."
Karlach,"But loneliness that deep gets into the marrow. Now that I'm here - among friends - I can feel it burning out of me. Little by little, step by step."
Karlach,"Ew, gods, I do not want whatever's inside that guy all over me."
Karlach,Where would you start?
Karlach,"And put it somewhere interesting, I hope."
Karlach,"You give me chills, baby. No mean feat at my temperature."
Karlach,"Gods, we better find a way to cool me off soon. I'm not sure how much more of this I can take."
Karlach,All night. And then some.
Karlach,You and Wyll. I hope you're not saying what I think you're saying.
Karlach,And I'd even let you.
Karlach,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?"
Karlach,What does that even mean? You just forgot what we had? Or was it that you never even cared?
Karlach,Hey! That's Arabella. Kid from the druid's grove. That snake woman nearly did her in. Looks like she's learned a thing or two.
Karlach,"Fierce kid. Doubt she'll survive the shadows, but I hope she'll surprise us."
Karlach,What happened?
Karlach,"Well I wasn't. Not for a second. But I guess that doesn't mean much, does it."
Karlach,You and Lae'zel. Please tell me you're not saying what I think you're saying.
Karlach,Tsk. I really hoped it wouldn't come to this. Poor thing.
Karlach,"It's a good old life, isn't it."
Karlach,What can I do you for?
Karlach,Why're we slowing down?
Karlach,Maybe another time.
Karlach,"Hear that? All I need is a second bit of infernal metal, and I'm cured!"
Karlach,This is so exciting. Let's make tracks!
Karlach,"From what I can tell, Astarion really needs you. And you need him, too."
Karlach,I know I had designs on you. But I'm glad you found a little happiness with someone who could actually give it to you.
Karlach,"Yeah, yeah, I'm an angel. Giving away my one true love to a bloodthirsty toff."
Karlach,At least he's funny.
Karlach,Now get out of my sight. I have some stakes to sharpen.
Karlach,I'm not sharing you with that ruffle-collared leech. Over his dead body.
Karlach,"As long as he treats you right, I can deal. One wrong move, though, and I'm dumping his pomade in the river."
Karlach,I'm not sure what to say.
Karlach,What about Lae'zel? You mean to say you'd end things with her... for me?
Karlach,"Oh, thank the gods. I thought I was losing you for a second there. Not sure this old hunk of junk I call a heart can take any more damage."
Karlach,I'll leave it to you to deal with Lae'zel. She'll be all right. Nothing can bring that woman down. Not even you.
Karlach,Good luck. To both of you.
Karlach,No use now.
Karlach,Can't use that now.
Karlach,"When you get fucked up, you fuck up right back."
Karlach,I've got no interest in empathising with the fuck. But maybe what he did to me was some kind of mirror of what happened to him.
Karlach,Will you excuse me?
Karlach,You'd better step away before I do something I regret.
Karlach,Don't you think I deserve a little better than that?
Karlach,"Look at you, soldier. If I didn't know better, I'd say you're falling in love."
Karlach,"You and Lae'zel, huh? I can see it. She's made entirely of conviction. Enticing, on this trail of unknowns."
Karlach,Can't have been easy to win her favour. Hats off to you.
Karlach,"Well, you've got it. And my friendship, for as long as you want it."
Karlach,"Jerk me around a little more, why don't you? Gods! Look, would you feck off? I'm getting nauseous with all this back-and-forth."
Karlach,"Meanwhile, I'll say a prayer for every soft part of you. Lae'zel's going to whip you into shape, I'm sure."
Karlach,Those mercs had zero discipline. Wouldn't have lasted a blink in the Blood War.
Karlach,Darling.
Karlach,Hey!
Karlach,Out with it.
Karlach,"Well, well! Scuttlebutt around camp says I'm not the only person you've got all a-flutter."
Karlach,Hope Astarion wasn't too broken-hearted. Though I'm delighted to learn he's got a heart in the first place.
Karlach,So Gortash's parents sold him to a warlock. Why does that sound so familiar?
Karlach,Yeah?
Karlach,"Look, I'll be fine. I liked you, but I'll survive. It's kind of my thing."
Karlach,"Now. Begone, waffler! Your new love is awaiting their sloppy seconds."
Karlach,I thought you and Gale were... I don't know. Official.
Karlach,"Yeah, honey?"
Karlach,"Sharp eyes, soldier. We're not safe here."
Karlach,Coast is clear. We ought to get some shut-eye.
Karlach,Gods. A mind flayer's been getting their tentacles all over our dreams this whole time.
Karlach,I'm really not sure about putting any trust at all in this... thing. It's already shown itself a liar.
Karlach,I've got my eyes on 'the Emperor.' And Karlach doesn't blink.
Karlach,I was just thinking. You know - for a while there I thought there was something between us. I know you felt it too.
Karlach,That thing's about to blow!
Karlach,"But it blew out, didn't it? Can't capture lightning in a bottle, I guess. No matter much you want to. No hard feelings, of course. That's life."
Karlach,Guess it's activated elsewhere.
Karlach,Activated somewhere else.
Karlach,"Something happened, right?"
Karlach,"So. You and Astarion, huh? Were you gonna say it to my face? Or just wait 'til I figured it out on my own?"
Karlach,"A mind flayer? How is this possible? Gods, we've been so... blind."
Karlach,I guess this is our best chance. You can handle it. And I'll still like you just the same.
Karlach,"Don't do it! This isn't evolution, it's... it's... I don't know what it is."
Karlach,So. You and Minthara. Wow. Impressive.
Karlach,Hm?
Karlach,Something's unlocked.
Karlach,Now where'd that unlock?
Karlach,"Gale will be all right, right? Of course he will. He's Gale. If he can take a hit from Mystra, he can take it from you."
Karlach,"But poor Wyll. He's going to be heartbroken. Tsk. I don't know if he'll want me to be there for him, but... but, well, I don't know. This is shit."
Karlach,"I'm glad you chose me. But I'm sorry it comes at the cost of Wyll's heartbreak. Let him down easy, all right?"
Karlach,I'm not sure Astarion's the kind of guy whose heart you want to play with.
Karlach,Go tell that parasite you're finished with him. I'll bring him round a bottle of something cheap and cheerful later.
Karlach,I thought you and Shadowheart were going the distance. You can't have changed your mind.
Karlach,"I'm sorry for Shadowheart; it can't have been easy for her to open up to you. But I know she'll be all right. She's got a lot going for her, that one."
Karlach,Unlocked somewhere else.
Karlach,What about Minthara? Weren't you guys in some kind of horrific power play masquerading as romance?
Karlach,The most hideous words in the Common tongue.
Karlach,But give me a wide berth until then. All right?
Karlach,This fella and its ultimatums. But he's forgetting one thing.
Karlach,"Gods, I could sleep for a hundred years. Looks safe enough for a night, I reckon."
Karlach,"We could become illithid. I mean, I could. You could trust me to do what needs to be done."
Karlach,"If that's it, I need to see the body with my own two eyes. I need to know it's over."
Karlach,It's finished. It's done. I need to see him up close. I need to know he's dead.
Karlach,"Tell Minthara right away. She needs to be taken down a peg - badly. In fact, she'll probably get off on it."
Karlach,It's not your fault. It's... it's mine. I should've known. I shouldn't have... shouldn't have thought...
Karlach,Sparks.
Karlach,"If you're happy, I'm happy. Are you happy?"
Karlach,Ready when you are.
Karlach,It's like I'm beyond myself. I can sense things I never knew were there...
Karlach,"No heat. No gears. Still there, but no longer threatening to explode. Soldier... "
Karlach,Yes. Yes! My gods - is it possible?
Karlach,Shit. I'm gonna be all right. I get to be alive. I get to stay.
Karlach,"As a hideous monster, sure. But one that can feel. Think. Live."
Karlach,"But I'm still myself. And I still love you. And, more than anything, I know what our mission is. Delighted I get to do the honours."
Karlach,It is. It is incredible. And I intend to celebrate - after we've defeated the brain.
Karlach,I'll do you one better than good: Let's do something absolutely legendary.
Karlach,Hell yes we do.
Karlach,"Let's finish this thing, soldier. It's time. And I'm ready if you are."
Karlach,But I'm still myself. And I know what our mission is. I'm glad I get to do the honours.
Karlach,"I can probably handle a little fire, but I'm not sure about the rest of you."
Karlach,"This is something else. Something far deeper. Whatever ceremorphosis did to me, it... it fixed me."
Karlach,That means... I won't burn out.
Karlach,"Gods! We were so close, darling. Impossible odds."
Karlach,"We can do this, darling. We're nearly there."
Karlach,"Fuck yes, soldier. I'm burning hard and fast - and ready to fight a big old brain."
Karlach,I am ready to do what must be done. Let's do this.
Karlach,Let's move. A trot will take my mind off being barbecued alive.
Karlach,"It's an honour to work with you, ma'am."
Karlach,Milady.
Karlach,"Careful, vamp."
Karlach,"Hope that wasn't a lie; I hope we do get to meet up with Fytz, when this is all over."
Karlach,"First step, save the city. Then, save myself. And last but not least: dinner with an old friend. What more could you ask for?"
Karlach,We were so close. We almost had it. But those odds were... impossible.
Karlach,Here I thought I was making a sacrifice. Thank the gods I'm a noble fuck!
Karlach,"You can count on me, soldier. I can do this."
Karlach,"Lead on, my love. This place is a horror, but we can do this."
Karlach,"Hup hup, soldier. We have a mission to complete."
Karlach,"Lead on, soldier. This nasty hole has nothing on us."
Karlach,Ah. What were we doing again?
Karlach,"It should've been me, but what can I say? A few tentacles look good on you."
Karlach,I didn't know there was so much me beyond myself.
Karlach,And I didn't know I had a chance at life - more life. I'm so... happy.
Karlach,ls::TranslatedStringRepository::s_HandleUnknown
Karlach,"Don't worry, soldier. It's still your old pal under all this purple. But suddenly 'I' am different than I ever knew."
Karlach,I'm not surprised. But I've never felt more like myself.
Karlach,You don't need to thank me. I somehow feel like... like this was meant for me.
Karlach,"You, you'll regret it. When I've got all your gear strapped to my back and you grow soft and spoiled, you'll regret it."
Karlach,Tsk. Pity about Wyll. He would've made a good ally. Tracked me down pretty handily - that takes skill.
Karlach,Why'd you send him away?
Karlach,"That's fair. I assumed it was Zariel, but he seemed to hate devils as much as I do."
Karlach,"Maybe this means I've got another, different target on my back. Goodie!"
Karlach,Why do I find that hard to believe?
Karlach,That little bastard - where'd he go?
Karlach,"Water under the bridge, as far as I'm concerned. Looking forward to working with you, Wyll."
Karlach,"Really? I liked him. Dedicated, but not fanatical. Bet that eye had a good story behind it, too."
Karlach,"Can't imagine why. You're sound, he's sound. You've got a tadpole, he's got a tadpole. Like jam and scones."
Karlach,Where's the clash? You're both sound operators with tadpoles in your heads. But - the decision's made.
Karlach,"May the Blade of Frontiers fight evil on his own time, then. And may he smite only the most deservingest of vermin."
Karlach,"Someone wrong-footed him about me. Probably Zariel, somehow or other. Now Wyll's another of her victims."
Karlach,I'm afraid so. Maybe he would've listened if we'd reasoned with him a little longer. Or maybe we should've just outrun him. I don't know.
Karlach,"I never forget anything, unfortunately."
Karlach,You say that. But he didn't come spoiling to kill a normal tiefling like me. He thought I was something I'm not.
Karlach,"Well, may the Blade of Frontiers fight evil on his own time, then. And may he smite only the most deservingest of vermin."
Karlach,"Had a nice break in the Hells. Now that we're back, my engine's in overdrive again."
Karlach,"Well, looks like we've got the mutual respect secured. Next stop: friends."
Karlach,"He won't. Someone wrong-footed him about me, and I'm betting we'll find out who before long."
Karlach,Maybe not the tentacles. But - you know. Bigger picture.
Karlach,"Eyes ahead, soldier. We're nearly there."
Karlach,"He looks the exact same as he did ten years ago. Fancier coat, I suppose."
Karlach,The Archduke of Baldur's Gate. What a sham.
Karlach,"Pot, meet kettle."
Karlach,I hope it won't be too late by then.
Karlach,"Gortash is your enemy either way. This 'pact' may delay the inevitable betrayal, but not by much."
Karlach,"I respect someone who can admit when they're wrong. And stick around after, too. Plus, did you see his eye? Bet there's a good story there."
Karlach,"Don't let him suck you in. He paints a pretty picture, then rips it to shreds right in front of your nose."
Karlach,"I'll play along for now, but I'm not letting him slip out of reach. He's going to pay for what he did to me, one way or another."
Karlach,"I can't tell if you're very wise or very foolish. Time will tell, I guess."
Karlach,"Fascinating perspective. We'll have to see about that, won't we?"
Karlach,"Fair enough. Now that he's within reach, I don't intend to let him slip away."
Karlach,Glad Wyll saw sense. Even more glad he decided to stick around. Takes a pretty slick mover to track down ol' Karlach.
Karlach,"Fair. But still, the man's got a reputation for being lethal with that blade. I'm glad it's on our side."
Karlach,"Same. Now, instead of a liability, I've got a friend. Or - I will have soon, anyway."
Karlach,I know the feeling. We've got to set her free.
Karlach,Yay!
Karlach,"Careful, soldier. I'm burning really hot."
Karlach,Go get boss if you want to talk.
Karlach,Damn. Now there's something I never thought I'd see. Brutal.
Karlach,Holy shit. An orthon. Powerful devils - I wouldn't get on their bad side without a good reason. 
Karlach,Hey.
Karlach,I need to think a bit.
Karlach,Not now. I need a moment.
Karlach,Something on your mind?
Karlach,It takes a brave man indeed to say 'no' to Lae'zel of Crèche K'liir.
Karlach,It takes a brave woman indeed to say 'no' to Lae'zel of Crèche K'liir.
Karlach,It takes a brave person indeed to say 'no' to Lae'zel of Crèche K'liir.
Karlach,"To be honest, I'm kind of shocked you chose me. Of everyone with a great big question mark over their future, mine is the biggest and most questionable."
Karlach,"In that case, we're a match made in... Faerûn."
Karlach,"Let's ask questions, then. How long can a moment last? Are we as happy as two people can be?"
Karlach,We can spend the rest of our lives looking for answers - but who cares if we find them?
Karlach,I'm seeing you at a desk. Pile of books up to the ceiling. And me barging in with a brace of rabbits for supper.
Karlach,You start chopping carrots. I stoke the fire. And every night is the best night we've ever had.
Karlach,We piss off a devil no matter what we do. Pick your poison - we'll handle the fallout like we always do.
Karlach,"I'm not one to placate a devil, but the last thing we need is an orthon for an enemy. Fought one once, and my back has never been the same."
Karlach,Wait. Maybe you don't have to. It... it should be me.
Karlach,"Can't reach camp from here, soldier. You'll have to wait to throw me over. So sorry."
Karlach,Could've have said it better myself.
Karlach,Sure. What's on your mind?
Karlach,I think so too. I've never met anyone like you. And I doubt I ever will again.
Karlach,Wh-what does that mean?
Karlach,Make room then! And hurry!
Karlach,What are we talking here? Lemure? Pit fiend? Orthon?
Karlach,"Ooh, spooky."
Karlach,I'll keep deserving it. I promise.
Karlach,You're gonna have to tell one of the others to scram if you want to make room for me.
Karlach,Fuck yes!
Karlach,Hell yes!
Karlach,Aces!
Karlach,Ah come on. You don't mean that.
Karlach,Sounds boring.
Karlach,"Ah, fine. I'll be here eating dirt or whatever."
Karlach,"If you insist. I'll make my way back, but don't be long, all right?"
Karlach,Let's go go go!
Karlach,What do you know of infernal machinery?
Karlach,Holy shit. An orthon. Powerful devils - I wouldn't get on their bad side without a good reason.
Karlach,If life decides my fate is a happy ending with you... it will all have been worth it. Everything.
Karlach,Don't know who 'the Stone Lord' is or what the hell he's gotten himself into. But that man is a legend.
Karlach,I should've known Gale would weave his spell on you. Who could resist?
Karlach,"I know I had... well. You know I liked you. Like you. But I want you to be with someone who can make you happy. If that's Gale, that's Gale."
Karlach,My friendship. Wonderful.
Karlach,"Look, I'll be all right. Give me a night to lick my wounds and patch up my pride, and I'll be right back to crushing evil before sunrise."
Karlach,Florrick. We've got to help her.
Karlach,There's something highly suspicious about these ever-more-eloquent rats.
Karlach,I'm exhausted. Weird.
Karlach,"Hope you don't regret throwing over all this fire for all that hot air. One'll get you through winter, the other'll recite you a lot of codices. But hey. To each their own."
Karlach,"When Gale's on page one hundred thirty six of a supremely boring recitation, and you look over and there I am throwing a lasso around a giant centipede and riding it to Chult, I'll have my comeuppance."
Karlach,I don't want to wait any more. Can we knock the others out so we can go to bed?
Karlach,That sounded like a threat. I like threats.
Karlach,"Spiteful little lad. Hint of malice in its eyes, too. That's not normal, is it?"
Karlach,That's a mean ol' rat. Wonder what's bothering it.
Karlach,"Gale climbed out of the Weave long enough to waggle his eyebrow in your direction, huh?"
Karlach,Sorry - haven't fraternised with you much and not sure I want to start.
Karlach,"Oh-ho no you don't. Karlach is a one-person gal. You've made your choice, now you have to live with the consequences."
Karlach,Tell it to the chief.
Karlach,It's finished. It's done. I need to see him up close. I need to know he's out of commission.
Karlach,"I'm a hungry lady. I don't think I have it in me to share. Not now, anyway."
Karlach,"Argh, I just love listening to you speak. Even when you're being the wickedest little freak in Faerûn."
Karlach,"A fair point. The chilly, dark lady and the fire-hearted hellian. A good combination, right?"
Karlach,"I know I can make you melt. And I know you can touch me without getting burned. Oh, the possibilities."
Karlach,"You've taught me so much. So much about how much a person can hold. When I look at you, it's like I'm staring at a puzzle I'll never solve. But one I want to spend my life enjoying."
Karlach,Yeah. We'll... work on that. Together.
Karlach,I'm willing to spend the rest of my life figuring you out.
Karlach,"Man, I slept like shit."
Karlach,"But hey - don't worry about me. If you prefer little miss, then it probably wouldn't have worked out between us anyway. Soldier."
Karlach,That was Gortash - the 'gauntlet of Bane'. The man who sold me to Zariel. I'm fucking speechless.
Karlach,"You and Shadowheart. She's got a sweetness to her, just beneath the surface. And you're good at getting just beneath the surface."
Karlach,I won't lie: I wish it could be you and me. But... I get that it can't. I do.
Karlach,"Hahaha! Oh wow. Yes. That's what you get, fucker."
Karlach,"Whoa, whoa, soldier, what are you doing?!"
Karlach,Shit - no! It's all been leading to this - we stop the brain. Now!
Karlach,Of course. What else are friends for?
Karlach,"And I'm sure we both care about you. I can't speak for Shadowheart, but for me... I want all of you. Or... whoever comes next."
Karlach,"Come on. I need to stomp something, and Ketheric's standing right there."
Karlach,You should go. I'll get through this. But it's going to hurt. And the worst part is - is I need to do it alone.
Karlach,"I'm pissed. I'm grateful. Gods! If I can't change your mind, I suppose I can only say... thank you."
Karlach,"'Latent potential'. All right - let's do this. I'm ready! Turn me, dammit!"
Karlach,"Thank you. But beauty no longer concerns me. This vessel, this flesh, is but a means to experience the depths within and without."
Karlach,I suppose this is goodbye. Soldier.
Karlach,"Congratulations on your victories, and don't hesitate to call on me in future, if need should arise."
Karlach,We have accomplished so much together. And will continue to achieve a great deal apart.
Karlach,I will miss you. But I wish you luck.
Karlach,Where will you go now?
Karlach,I accept your assessment. You would have been an excellent helpmate in my exploration of what it is to live. But perhaps we are both of us too... changed.
Karlach,You will be a helpful partner in my exploration of what it is to be - to be - alive.
Karlach,"Those fires would have consumed me - and you, perhaps. But I promise to find new and interesting ways to keep you warm."
Karlach,"This is only the beginning, my love. We will reach heights of which our former selves could not conceive."
Karlach,Somewhere quiet. Somewhere private. Somewhere we can ask a million questions and contemplate their answers.
Karlach,Let us begin. Together as one.
Karlach,We are indomitable. And the life we lead will be legendary.
Karlach,"At your side I have learned to make peace with death, to accept new life, to conquer all that stands in the way of us and our destiny."
Karlach,Maybe you're right. I feel less... changeable. Less afraid. I feel ready for whatever is to come.
Karlach,"Aww, it likes you!"
Karlach,Whoa - looks like it found a new friend.
Karlach,Wow. It must be love.
Karlach,Tough luck. Let me know if you need to borrow a little elbow grease.
Karlach,"I know you and Wyll have been getting close, by the way. I owe him a lot, but I don't owe him you."
Karlach,"Have your fun, but save some for me, all right? I won't be too hot to touch for long."
Karlach,"You have your fun with the others 'til then - I don't mind sharing, if I must. But keep a piece left over for me, hmm?"
Karlach,You have no one but yourself - and Zariel - to blame.
Karlach,I'm waiting!
Karlach,Yes! We can play one-a-cup!
Karlach,Godsdamned one-eyed fool. If only he'd listened.
Karlach,"I love you too. Before, that love was an irrepressible inferno. Now it is a calm, cool object of beauty."
Karlach,Pretty sure it was purple.
Karlach,Vamps don't scare me. As long as they keep their teeth to themselves.
Karlach,"No sense judging someone for who they are. Except devils, obviously."
Karlach,"A vamp, huh? Interesting. Keep your teeth to yourself, Astarion, and we won't have any issues."
Karlach,"Come on. We all have our secrets - and our risks. If Gale leaves, we might as well disband completely."
Karlach,Absolutely. We're all risky in our own ways. We stick together anyway. Right?
Karlach,Whoa. What the fuck just happened?
Karlach,That was... expressive? 
Karlach,Wait! No! I know this one. K'ha's - sji - 'trach - 'ash!<br>
Karlach,Proud. Grateful. Powerful.
Karlach,Soldier.
Karlach,Wait. There's another way. You know what's waiting for me - nothing but oblivion. This could be my last good deed.
Karlach,"I shouldn't have let you come here. This isn't going to be easy, you know. Zariel's going to come at us with everything she's got."
Karlach,"I shouldn't have let you come here. This isn't going to be easy, you know. Zariel's going to come at us with everything she's got, and now Raphael's in the mix, too."
Karlach,It worked. My engine's calmed down.
Karlach,"Well, soldier. Here we are."
Karlach,SFX only: A battle cry as Karlach runs toward the imp horde with her axe raised overhead.
Karlach,We did. Together. And now it's done.
Karlach,"And I'd do it again. Whatever it took. For the city. For the world. But most of all, for you."
Karlach,Gods. Like clockwork. They'll be on us soon - but there's just enough time.
Karlach,"It's the one thing I can't beat, isn't it? I wanted to live. In my city. With my friends."
Karlach,So were you. My friend. My companion. I adore you.
Karlach,"For you. And for the city, and for myself, and blah, blah. But most of all, for you."
Karlach,"I'm ready. I... I... Stand back, I'm going to -"
Karlach,"I thought I knew... I thought I knew, but you..."
Karlach,H-hurry. I'm going to... I don't have much time...
Karlach,I can't hang on much longer.
Karlach,You can't. You...
Karlach,I never gave up. I did my best. I did my best.
Karlach,"You have your fun with the pretty boy 'til then - I don't mind sharing. But keep a piece left over for me, hmm?"
Karlach,Thought I was done with these...
Karlach,Imps are fast but careless. Don't let 'em tire you out - just get rid of 'em. And don't forget:
Karlach,"Let me do this for you. For me. Please, darling. I want to."
Karlach,Wait. You don't have to do this. There's another option - me.
Karlach,I'm dying. My heart feels like a live grenade - gonna blow any minute. You still have a life to live. I don't.
Karlach,But it isn't a sacrifice. Not to me. I... I'm dying. This thing in my chest is burning me through.
Karlach,"You always were sensible. This heart inside me is about to blow. Doesn't matter which body it obliterates, right?"
Karlach,"If this is the end for me, let me be the motherfucker who saved the world."
Karlach,"Any time, soldier."
Karlach,...but then there was you.
Karlach,"You'll still love me when I've got a face full of tentacles, right?"
Karlach,"Well would you look at that. If I had a bit more time, I think I could get used to this."
Karlach,"I know you. I know you know your own mind. If this is what you want, then all I can say is give 'em Hell, soldier."
Karlach,Nice.
Karlach,Cute.
Karlach,Better let these fuckers know I'm back.
Karlach,"Better let these fuckers know I'm back. And this time, I'm not alone."
Karlach,You asked for this.
Karlach,"You'll still go drinking with me when I've got a face full of tentacles, right?"
Karlach,Fine. I'll go. Wyll. With you.
Karlach,"I don't mind sharing you with the bookworm while I'm indisposed, by the way. I'm sure he can keep you entertained until I'm more... approachable."
Karlach,"That's the only way to take 'em, isn't it?"
Karlach,"Don't get me wrong, I'd ride him to the Feywild and back if I had the chance, but I wouldn't let my guard down around him."
Karlach,"Good to see the two of you getting along, anyway. At least one of us is getting a little action."
Karlach,"Though... you know. If you wanted to meet up later, maybe we could... meet up. Later."
Karlach,"I know. But you only live once, and if you never throw your dart, you'll never hit the bull's eye."
Karlach,Thank you for noticing.
Karlach,Not if I enjoy you first.
Karlach,I don't think your little friend would let me hear the end of it if I accepted. No matter how much I wanted to.
Karlach,Enjoy yourself tonight. You've earned it.
Karlach,"I'll come find you when the others have gone to bed. Wait up for me, all right?"
Karlach,(Yes!)
Karlach,But there's something I think you should know.
Karlach,Hear that? Infernal engine for a heart. Lets me burn as hot as the Hells. Seems to be running in overdrive since I left Avernus.
Karlach,"Won't be seeing my mechanic any time soon, so I'm afraid I just can't get too close."
Karlach,High pain tolerance. And a dynamic duo of truly shitty bosses.
Karlach,"Burn, baby. As hot as I can tolerate. Makes me a beast in battle. Hardly remember what I was like before it."
Karlach,"Speaking of possibilities, what's this I've been hearing about you and Astarion?"
Karlach,But hey. At least some of us are getting a little action.
Karlach,"Speaking of, I hate to butt in, but I've seen the way you and Lae'zel have been looking at each other."
Karlach,Really now? Cause I think you suit me perfectly.
Karlach,Might be facing Gortash sooner than we thought.
Karlach,"What the hells did you expect, Astarion? Come on!"
Karlach,Mm-mmm...
Karlach,Hmm-mmm...
Karlach,Na na na...
Karlach,Would you look at this place? All these people - happy because of us.
Karlach,And with such lovely company.
Karlach,Well now! Maybe I could make his acquaintance? A tightened screw or two might let me keep a little calmer.
Karlach,"I tried, in the beginning. Blew up in my face spectacularly. Lesson learned, never try to befriend a devil, cambion, or imp. "
Karlach,But hey - enough about that. That's history now. I want to think about the future.
Karlach,The one nice thing about being trapped in the inexorable grind of time is you've always got something to look forward to.
Karlach,Me too. I don't think I've ever looked forward to anything as much.
Karlach,"Bye, soldier."
Karlach,Don't look too far back. We only just met.
Karlach,I bet you could make me last as long as you wanted.
Karlach,"Haha! I really know how to lay it on thick, don't I? Ah well. What can I say? I'm excited to be alive. And excited about what's to come."
Karlach,"Orthons are good for a drink and joke, but you can't turn your back on 'em."
Karlach,But let's not get into tragic backstories now. It's such a beautiful night.
Karlach,Who knows! Maybe I can run like this indefinitely. But... maybe not.
Karlach,You. Me. Friends. Got it? Good.
Karlach,"Ah, come on. I know I'm not really who you're interested in. And anyway, even if I were, you couldn't touch me without getting burnt to a crisp."
Karlach,"Ah, c'mon, let's not spoil an effective thing. You point, I rage, we win. Doesn't need to be more complicated than that."
Karlach,"You too, soldier. "
Karlach,Can't wait for bed time. See you soon.
Karlach,"Cheers to you, soldier. And to me, if I do say so myself."
Karlach,Have fun.
Karlach,"Oh, this is clever. Might even work. C'mere."
Karlach,I tried to make friends at first. Learned my lesson fast. Better to keep to yourself in Hell.
Karlach,Mmm. I'm dizzy. And you - are you all right?
Karlach,They're still zipping around inside me.
Karlach,I know I can't have much more than that - not until we've found a more permanent solution to the hellfire issue. 
Karlach,"Mine too. Soon enough, you're going to be mine. But until then, I'll play nice."
Karlach,"Gods, me too. That was... amazing. But it is what it is, isn't it? I may not be able to have any fun, but you're still free as a lark."
Karlach,"You have your fun with the angry alien 'til then - I don't mind sharing. But keep a piece left over for me, hmm?"
Karlach,I'd believe you if you said one plus one is seven.
Karlach,"I will, then."
Karlach,"I hope that's true. 'Cause I'm hoping for seconds, thirds, and fourths, once we find a way to cool off this engine."
Karlach,"I know you and hairdo girl have something happening, but keep a piece left over for me, hmm? I won't always be too hot to touch."
Karlach,Not so much. You spend the whole time avoiding swords and schemes. Plus people just get nastier as the night wears on.
Karlach,All I need now is a fire-retardant lover to get lost in 'til sunrise.
Karlach,"Don't worry. I will. And I've got a good arm, you know."
Karlach,Ach. That is agonising! But I get it. I guess.
Karlach,"Well look, soldier, I won't always be too hot for words and deeds. You may regret to find that I happen to be very touch-worthy, underneath the searing, lethal flames."
Karlach,"Enjoy the party. And enjoy so-and-so too, while you're at it. For now."
Karlach,Really? I mean - great!
Karlach,I don't know if you mean that. But I hope you do.
Karlach,I just want that to be me. Somehow. Some day.
Karlach,Speaking of which... there's something I wanted to tell you.
Karlach,"I can handle it. After all, life was made to be lived. And that's exactly what you're doing."
Karlach,"Take you and Gale, for instance. Don't think I haven't noticed the sparks flying."
Karlach,"He's a good egg. A little scholarly for my tastes, but I'm sure you could crack his spine like a new book."
Karlach,"She's a funny one. All pointy and secretive, but it seems like there's someone very sweet beneath it all, you know?"
Karlach,"Then we have you and Wyll, the ultimate incarnation of all things good in the world. There's something between you two, isn't there?"
Karlach,"He's a good one. The best, maybe. When I think about what he sacrificed for me... Give him something to smile about, all right?"
Karlach,"And with good potations, too."
Karlach,Fuck yes! I'm celebrating my freedom. And our friendship. And these folks' bright future besides.
Karlach,"Enjoy yourself, soldier. You deserve it."
Karlach,"Goodbye, sun. Goodbye, sea. Goodbye."
Karlach,How'd I do? Spectacular.
Karlach,Careful - hot.
Karlach,Let's just keep moving. I don't want to talk.
Karlach,Can't say you didn't choose well. Wyll looks absolutely besotted. 
Karlach,I know I had designs on you. But I'm glad you found a little happiness with someone who could actually give it to you. Especially someone like Wyll.
Karlach,"Wyll's got me wrapped around his little finger, to be honest. You treat him right, you hear?"
Karlach,"And if this blessed union should result in long term bliss, Auntie Karlach will be here to take the bairns off your hands whenever you wish."
Karlach,"'Cause I'm starving, soldier. I'm not going to share you. Or... whoever comes after you, I suppose. I doubt Wyll would, either."
Karlach,"He's traditional, and I'm just a ravenous beast who wants all the attention for herself. Ain't sorry about it, either."
Karlach,"Hey, soldier."
Karlach,Soldier?
Karlach,Copper for your thoughts?
Karlach,This place is an illithid stronghold. Let's finish what we came here to do and get out.
Karlach,I'm fine. Let's just get in and get out.
Karlach,"Gods, this place is absolutely beautiful. What a wonder."
Karlach,"If we didn't have a god's bidding to do, I'd suggest a bit of stargazing."
Karlach,Not in the middle of a fight.
Karlach,"Couldn't tell me to my face, huh? Had to wait 'til I just... just figured it out."
Karlach,Fuck off if you're here to talk about Gale. I already know.
Karlach,"I hope she does. And we see each other again soon, both less explosive than ever before."
Karlach,"What do you say, Gale?"
Karlach,H-hello? Withers - is that you? 
Karlach,Where am I?
Karlach,My companions? I can see them? How long has it been?
Karlach,Wait - the City of Judgement? How long will I stay there? And how long have I been asleep?
Karlach,They're alive. I'm dead. Let's leave it at that.
Karlach,I can see Astarion?
Karlach,I can see Halsin?
Karlach,Not while I'm fighting.
Karlach,I can see Gale?
Karlach,I can see Lae'zel?
Karlach,Stop this right now. You have a life ahead of you - don't waste it!
Karlach,"Oh no - Astarion, you're burning up. Take cover, quickly!"
Karlach,I can see Shadowheart?
Karlach,I can see Minthara?
Karlach,I hear you - but I don't know who or what I am.
Karlach,I think we've earned a celebration. Don't you?
Karlach,I can see Wyll?
Karlach,After I've won this.
Karlach,So here you are. I hear I'm not the only keeping you warm at night.
Karlach,Oh man. I could do with a whole new night of sleep.
Karlach,I like it too. Mucous suits you. And you saved us all.<br>
Karlach,"I saved the fucking world. And I think I might live long enough to tell the tale, too."
Karlach,Don't worry about me. I'm... happy. 
Karlach,"I did, didn't I?"
Karlach,It's all right. I knew what I was doing.
Karlach,"Goodbye, Lae'zel. You've been absolutely unforgettable."
Karlach,I thought... I thought this was real. I thought this was special. What happened?
Karlach,"I'd ask you to explain yourself, but it's clear you have no idea what you want. I hope you figure it out before anyone else gets hurt."
Karlach,But... my heart is telling me I love you. It's about the only good news it's given me.
Karlach,What do you do when the person you want to run to is the one who broke your heart?
Karlach,But... but I still feel it. What about that? I guess... that doesn't count?
Karlach,"Gods, what is this?! What's this feeling? I thought I knew every type of hurt there was. I didn't know anything, did I?"
Karlach,I have nothing to lose anymore. I'm burning up - burning out. But this is something I can still do - this is how I can help save the city I love.
Karlach,"The Emperor may be a mind flayer, but we have needed all the help we've received. I don't think we should stop now."
Karlach,"We have more options than we knew, Lae'zel. Give me the chance to convince you."
Karlach,Hang on - we need to talk this through. There's so much at stake...
Karlach,Argh! I just don't... I don't understand how this happened. What went wrong.
Karlach,"Where once we gasped and begged and cried for the pleasures and fripperies of our old life in Faerûn, now we will be unafraid to plumb its depths. We will discover..."
Karlach,"My heart isn't a toy, got it? Treat it like one and you're going to get burned. Badly."
Karlach,I knew something was wrong. I just wish you would've told me sooner.
Karlach,"Hey, we're still going after those paladins, right? Can't leave Zariel's bruisers roaming the coast."
Karlach,Good news. Can't wait to see 'em finished.
Karlach,Not really. I'd rather send Zariel a message to leave me the fuck alone.
Karlach,"Believe me, it won't take long. Let's go mop 'em up real quick and take it from there. Come on! It'll be fun."
Karlach,Let's talk later.
Karlach,Hey - can I try something on you? 
Karlach,"Well, look who's here. Shadowheart's new toy."
Karlach,"I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully: The people who care about you aren't playthings. You don't get to toss them aside and then pick them up again when you get bored."
Karlach,"Hey, you."
Karlach,"Oh, hi!"
Karlach,Infernal metal! Yes! We've got to bring this to Dammon soon as we can.
Karlach,"Ohoho yes, this is it! I'm gonna be a whole Karlach!"
Karlach,"Hey, solider."
Karlach,Uh huh?
Karlach,"Shadowheart took it all right, I hope. Don't like to see our girl too down in the mouth."
Karlach,"Hey. So. You're here to talk about Wyll, right? You and Wyll, I should say."
Karlach,What're you thinking about?
Karlach,"For the better. And from this new vantage point, all is possible. "
Karlach,We are changed. Fundamentally changed.
Karlach,"We can rise to heights so far impossible to fathom. We will plumb the depths of the city, retreat to its deepest core and discover..."
Karlach,"No more tadpoles, brain. It's time to die. "
Karlach,Time to end this thing.
Karlach,"This is it, soldier. This is what we fought for."
Karlach,Subdued. At last. This is its death rattle. 
Karlach,So soon? How strange. I thought our bond was... I don't know. Formidable.
Karlach,"I wouldn't mind paying Amn a visit. Never been that far south, myself."
Karlach,"I may not be as strong as I used to be, but I'll be much better at advising the project."
Karlach,Stop - STOP! What are you doing?!
Karlach,"I hope you are wrong, my friend. "
Karlach,"You're burning up, soldier. Take cover!"
Karlach,Back to the shadows. But perhaps not forever. Even though worst affliction can be fixed - with some amount of sacrifice.
Karlach,"I wouldn't mind a very well-earned libation, myself."
Karlach,"You're preaching to the doomed choir, ma'am."
Karlach,"Well, woman. Here I am. I did what I came here to do, and now it's done. I'm burning out. I'm burning out."
Karlach,"It's time, isn't it?"
Karlach,Time to celebrate!
Karlach,"Whatever our next step, we each have our own path to forge. Mine stranger than I ever believed possible - and yet, possible."
Karlach,"That's over, I'm afraid. What comes next is... the end."
Karlach,No... what are you doing?! 
Karlach,This is it. You have to command it to die!
Karlach,So? H-how'd I do?
Karlach,Engine's finally cooked. Held on just long enough.
Karlach,"We did it, soldier. The city's going to be all right. And so are you."
Karlach,"Goodbye, sun. Goodbye, sea. Good-"
Karlach,I'm slipping. I can't hang on. I... what's happening?!
Karlach,We did it. I did it. The city's going to be all right. My friends are going to be all right. I can let go.
Karlach,I'm not ready.
Karlach,This was all I had... 
Karlach,I'm hot. Too hot. I think... I think this is it. The engine's finally cooked.
Karlach,What the fuck are those?!
Karlach,"Looks like that Crown could use some Netherstones. If these things were ever going to work, it's now.<br>"
Karlach,"Looks like that Crown could use some Netherstones. If these things were ever going to work, it's now."
Karlach,"See you on the other side, Gale. It's been an honour."
Karlach,"I'm on borrowed time anyway. But don't pull the pin until you have to, hey? We might still win the old fashioned way.<br>"
Karlach,Gale? What's wrong?
Karlach,It knows this is the end of the road. Pay it no mind.
Karlach,HAIL THE ABSOLUTE!
Karlach,"Hope he'll find the truth, now. And peace."
Karlach,"What about you though, Lae'zel? What's your plan?"
Karlach,Lae'zel! No - stop!
Karlach,My condition has been cured. I will live. I will be who I was meant to be.
Karlach,Won't I?
Karlach,No. We will be far more than we ever could have conceived.
Karlach,"We will go beyond the glaring light of Faerûn - the light we missed so much before. We will retreat to her depths, to the very bowels of being, and discover..."
Karlach,...life. This new life. 
Karlach,Who needs a heart when you have all this?
Karlach,He did it... he actually did it... he blew up the Netherbrain.
Karlach,I am Karlach. Karlach Cliffgate. Of Baldur's Gate.
Karlach,He did it... he actually did it... he blew up the Netherbrain. 
Karlach,And all it cost was our friend.
Karlach,All it cost us was our friend.
Karlach,"Gale gave his life for us, for everyone... and now he's gone."
Karlach,But we'll never forget him. And neither will the city he saved.
Karlach,But he'll never be forgotten. His name - his sacrifice - will live forever.
Karlach,He's a hero. A fucking hero.
Karlach,Why limit ourselves? We can be all. We can be everything.
Karlach,And the tadpole is gone at last.
Karlach,"Goodbye, dragon riders. I wish you the best - in your home plane, preferably."
Karlach,Say good-bye.
Karlach,Time to die...
Karlach,Can I do this?
Karlach,"Yes. Yes, I can. Yes. All I need is to see the sky one last time."
Karlach,I don't think I have any other choice. Unless I go back to the Hells.
Karlach,There has to be another way.
Karlach,I could return to the Hells. I could go back. 
Karlach,Raphael will be causing mayhem down there. Zariel won't have time to bother with me.
Karlach,Maybe I could do some good...
Karlach,Time to...
Karlach,It's better than dying. I want to live. Even in the Hells.
Karlach,"It's now or never. Goodbye, Faerûn. For now."
Karlach,We did it. We actually did it. And the city's still standing.
Karlach,We did it. We actually did it. And the city's still standing. 
Karlach,Fucking hell. It's over.
Karlach,We really did it!
Karlach,No! I want to die in the world I love. Not struggle on in the world I hate.
Karlach,All right then. Let's do this. I just want to see the sky one more time before I go...
Karlach,"It'll take grit, but I've got that. It'll take a big fuck-off sword, but I've got one of those too. All right. I can do this."
Karlach,Dogs in the distance. Just outside the light - for now.
Karlach,"Well, well, well. A vampire in our very camp."
Karlach,I had my suspicions. Which you proved all-too-right.
Karlach,"One of the worst things about getting old? Watching kids make the same exact mistakes you made, and knowing there's absolutely nothing you can say to change their mind."
Karlach,"Then again, Mol's a hell of a lot smarter than I was at that age. Maybe she'll figure it all out."
Karlach,True enough. She'll go far in the city. We've just got to get her there safely.
Karlach,"Hope you're right. I'll keep an eye on her anyway. Doesn't hurt to have a beefy auntie on your side, right?"
Karlach,"If that happens, maybe ol' auntie fire hands can pull her out."
Karlach,Check this out!
Karlach,Of course I can. Of course... I... can...
Karlach,"Phew. Looks like I've got a few kinks to work out with that one. Pretty amazing though, right? Who knows what I could do after a few more soul coins."
Karlach,"Then let's go find one, soldier. This fire is ready to burn something wicked."
Karlach,But it didn't. That's the key here. And now I can use that power to our advantage.
Karlach,"Don't hold me back, and I'll be your biggest ally. You'll see."
Karlach,"No, you are. Believe me, you don't want to make an enemy of me. Got it?"
Karlach,"If I decide to burn you, you'll burn. Trust that I don't, and won't."
Karlach,There. See? Perfectly in hand. I don't know what you were so tweaked about.
Karlach,"Nothing's too much for me - you can quote me on that. Now let me put my money where my mouth is - point me at the nearest devil, and I'll burn him clean."
Karlach,"I'll follow you until I can't, Wyll. That, at least, I can promise you."
Karlach,They never lose. Not ever.
Karlach,That's not going to happen. You hear me? But you don't win against a devil by playing one of their games.
Karlach,I know that. I never forget it.
Karlach,"The tadpole. It's turned you, hasn't it? It was only a matter of time."
Karlach,"You may serve the Absolute, but I don't, all right? I don't!"
Karlach,Godsdammit. Why did it have to be Mizora. Why did it have to be Zariel?
Karlach,I want to believe that as much as you do. Almost as much as Wyll does. But I just know there will be more to the story. There always is.
Karlach,It's a bad idea to play games with a devil. You never win. Not ever.
Karlach,"Devils never lose. You know that, right? Sure, they'll give you a bit of tat here and there. But the house always wins."
Karlach,I never forget what Wyll did. Not ever. I'm here because of him. And I'd do just about anything to help him.
Karlach,Woo!
Karlach,"But devils never lose. You know that, right? Sure, they'll give you a bit of tat here and there. But the house always wins."
Karlach,"I guess so. But I'm telling you now, it's a bad idea to play games with a devil. You never win. Not ever."
Karlach,"Godsdammit, Wyll. Why did it have to be Mizora. Why did it have to be Zariel?"
Karlach,"You know I'd do just about anything for you. But we're being asked to retrieve one of Zariel's assets. What if it's a runaway, like me? Or something worse?"
Karlach,"Do you really believe that, Wyll? Deep down, do you?"
Karlach,"Look, I'll do anything I can to help you - nearly anything, at least. I want you to be free of this pact as much as you do."
Karlach,But it's a bad idea to play games with a devil. You never win. Not ever.
Karlach,"You know better than that, Wyll. You know better than anyone."
Karlach,"Look, Wyll's happiness is my happiness. I'd sooner see myself a lemure than him."
Karlach,"Perfect control. Pretty amazing, right?"
Karlach,Can't hide it - I'm certifiably wonderful.
Karlach,"Hey, wanna play pretend?"
Karlach,You know what? That was never part of my plan. But in this fantasy... I can picture it.
Karlach,"You. Me. Two little usses. That's a pretty picture, isn't it?"
Karlach,"Now you're talking. Faerûn is so big, and we've barely scratched the surface."
Karlach,"I've always wanted to square up against a hill giant. With two of us, we might even stand a chance."
Karlach,"We can dream, soldier. But the thing about dreams is they aren't real."
Karlach,"Anyway, either one of us could drop dead tomorrow for any reason at all. No moment is guaranteed. Except this one. And this one. And maybe this one too."
Karlach,I have no less than anyone else: a guarantee of nothing.
Karlach,"Gods, think of all the grass! The squirrels, the birds. I can practically smell it."
Karlach,"Hey - it's all right. I'm here now. And if you don't want to talk about the future, I understand."
Karlach,"That might be all you get too, darling. It's hard. But it's real. I like real things. Even when they're hard."
Karlach,I'm sure you had a good reason. Gods rest her.
Karlach,"There are enough Absolutists in this place to fill a reserve trench. One of 'em must have something interesting to say, right?"
Karlach,Let's find out.
Karlach,Really? Who?
Karlach,Ugh! So now the rat is sending out cockroaches. Joy.
Karlach,"Glad you're in one piece, but I doubt this little favour will come without a price. Let's get rid of this tadpole - cambion might lose interest when we're a little less, well, interesting."
Karlach,But. How do I say this? I don't have the luxury of avoiding what's coming. All I have are these moments between us. 
Karlach,You're mad. I can't believe I didn't see it. Stay away from me. You hear me?!
Karlach,"But I've got a creative streak of my own, you know. And making you laugh is my greatest accomplishment, every time I manage it."
Karlach,I'd love for you to show me where you came from. Hear your stories. Meet your people.
Karlach,You and me. Let's imagine: I get to live fifty more years. We have a whole life ahead of us. What do we do?
Karlach,"You know what? I haven't the faintest idea what that is, but it sounds so delightfully elfy, I'd follow you no questions asked."
Karlach,"Then again, I'd follow you just about anywhere. "
Karlach,Dammit. I wish I had a longer road ahead of me. I want to walk it with you.
Karlach,Gods! What a disaster. Finding love like this - finding you - so perfectly late.
Karlach,"I've always thought I was fearless. Never scared of a fight, of the future. But dying has taught me so much."
Karlach,"There's no courage in fearlessness. There's courage in being fucking terrified, but still going forward. Still being grateful. Still trying."
Karlach,"'Karlach on the stairs,' 'Karlach with a peach,' 'Karlach with her hair in plaits'. I can picture it all now."
Karlach,We're going to save this city. Together. It's going to be the last thing I do.
Karlach,"That's the spirit, soldier!"
Karlach,Let's get busy with it. I've got the rest of my life ahead of me. And a lot to do before I go.
Karlach,"I'm not really tough enough to face any of this, you know. I'm scared shitless."
Karlach,But... there's a courage in me I never knew I had.
Karlach,Please! I loved picturing our little-big life together. And maybe it's all playing out... somewhere. Among the realms. Among the stars.
Karlach,Dying has given me a courage I never knew.
Karlach,"I haven't spent enough time in the Underdark. It's so beautiful - the colours, the creatures."
Karlach,That's why I know we're going to win.
Karlach,"Guess we'll meet her again, if she means to get under our feet. Until then, I'm glad to see you're in one piece. Though just as tadpoley as ever. The search continues."
Karlach,"I can't believe this. You need to stop this. If you don't, I will."
Karlach,"Whoa, soldier. What did you just do?"
Karlach,That's a change. Seems like world-shattering revalations are coming at us from every angle these days.
Karlach,"You know, soldier, we're so fucked. The Dark Three are trying to consume the Sword Coast, we've still got tadpoles in our eyes, and I've got a ticking time bomb in my chest."
Karlach,I'm not sure anyone has ever been more fucked than this.
Karlach,"And yet... we're fine. In this moment, we're fine. Here I am. There you are. Breathing. Talking. Even laughing, if we want."
Karlach,"Is it very precious to say that, despite it all, I'm... happy?"
Karlach,"Ah, my love. We've been in danger since before we even met. "
Karlach,"I think we're just those kind of people. Exciteable, weapon-wielding fuckers with a flair for drama."
Karlach,Very fair. Maybe after we've sorted one or two of the life-ending calamities staring us down.
Karlach,Speaking of which... there's something I wanted to ask you.
Karlach,"In that case, there's something I wanted to ask you."
Karlach,"Gods, I've changed. I used to hamstring pit fiends for fun. Look at me now."
Karlach,"To make matters, worse, there's something I wanted to ask you."
Karlach,"Yeah, despite my best efforts. I kept trying to flop over and give up, but Karlach just won't let me."
Karlach,Did I miss anything important?
Karlach,"You hope correctly. Had a bit of a cry and a talking-to with the gods, but I think we're square now."
Karlach,Would you believe it if I said I'm all right?
Karlach,Nothing out of the ordinary then.
Karlach,I wish I could do what you're asking. I do. But there are things worse than death. Living in the Hells is one of them. I've done it long enough to know.
Karlach,I can't do it anymore. I'd wish for death every day. Let me go out surrounded by things I love - not things I hate.
Karlach,I think I can do anything if you're there. Even die.
Karlach,"Now! Enough tragedy. I'm not gone yet. And our schedule is packed with important heroics, isn't it."
Karlach,"Plus, if I cry any more, I'm going to run out of tears and start leaking motor oil."
Karlach,"Thanks for everything, darling. I love you. A lot."
Karlach,"Thanks for everything, soldier. I'm extremely glad to be in this thing together."
Karlach,"If I can do it, you can do it. We're in this thing together, you know. If you wanted an easy time of it, you should've given my head to those 'paladins' of Tyr way back when."
Karlach,"As it is, you're stuck loving an in-progress tragedy with a time bomb for a heart. Decisions, decisions."
Karlach,Did I miss anything meanwhile?
Karlach,Hopefully this little misstep has taught you a thing or two about decision-making.
Karlach,"All right. But if we don't, I hope I can count on you. You haven't let me down yet, and it'd be a poor showing to start now."
Karlach,Maybe. But I think... I think the gods are trying to show me my fate. And I think I'm ready to look at it.
Karlach,"No. I can't. I'd rather die here in Faerûn, my home, than live in service to a devil."
Karlach,So do I. I've done the calculus a hundred times. There's no permutation I can find that doesn't end in me dead or wishing for death.
Karlach,"This is it. This is all we have. Each other, and all the moments we have left."
Karlach,"This is it. This is all I have. This life, and all the moments I have left here."
Karlach,"I've considered it. Believe me, I have. But it would take Zariel all of a minute to suss me out and force me back into the Blood War."
Karlach,"Now. Let's get a move on before I start crying again. At the rate I'm going, all that'll come out is motor oil."
Karlach,Tell me you didn't take on Gortash. Not without me. You wouldn't have.
Karlach,At least take me to see the body. I have to see it. I have to look at him one more time.
Karlach,It's the least you could do.
Karlach,"Our bed? Look, I'm not opposed in theory, but that's really not where I'm at right now. Not in my soul, not in my body..."
Karlach,"Halsin's great. If there was going to be someone more, I could see it being him. But not now. Probably not ever."
Karlach,You don't need to apologise. I want to know what's on your mind. Always.
Karlach,"Look, I don't want to be with Halsin like that. But if you do... that matters to me."
Karlach,You weren't. You can talk to me about anything. Are you sure there's nothing else you want to say?
Karlach,What the hells just happened? What did you say to Jaheira?
Karlach,I can't believe she's gone.
Karlach,"I don't need to hear all the gory details, mind. But have a little fun while you can."
Karlach,Me too. Man. I still had so many questions for her.
Karlach,Speak for yourself. I plan to dwell significantly.
Karlach,One of the greatest heroes the realms have ever known just stormed away from us in a fury.
Karlach,Fuckin' shameful.
Karlach,"Watch your tongue or you'll lose it, soldier. Jaheira is twice the hero either of us will ever be."
Karlach,Don't you know the whole story?
Karlach,Years ago - over a century - Jaheira was part of a group that saved Baldur's Gate from Sarevok. A Bhaalspawn trying to plunge the city into war.
Karlach,My mum used to tell us stories about them - the legends who protected the city from evil. She said Jaheira was a powerful druid. Adamant. Tough.
Karlach,"Maybe if we all survive this thing, we can go make amends. I'd hate to leave things on bad terms. Not with a legend like her."
Karlach,"Listen to me. I'm trusting you. But if you disappoint me, it'll be the last thing you do."
Karlach,"I care for you. I don't want to lose you. But if... if Halsin is important to you, I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness."
Karlach,I see. And you came here to ask me...
Karlach,Fuck your Netherstone.
Karlach,"You saw Gortash, didn't you? What the fuck was he doing down there? Is all of this because of him?"
Karlach,I was his bodyguard. I looked after him with my life. I trusted him more than anything.
Karlach,He gave me away to Zariel just for kicks. He ruined my life just when it was starting.
Karlach,And now he'd use up the entire Sword Coast.
Karlach,He has to die. And I'm gonna be the one who kills him.
Karlach,"He can't get away with what he's done. To me, to us. He won't get away with it!"
Karlach,"Hmm. I need to chew on that, I think."
Karlach,You bet your arse I am. And I won't stop 'til that fucker is dead!
Karlach,"He gave me away to Zariel without a second thought, and now he's looking to ruin the entire Sword Coast."
Karlach,"Whatever the fuck he's been up to in the last ten years, we have to stop him. He can't just keep ruining peoples' lives. He can't get away with it!"
Karlach,He used me up and gave me away when he was done with me. Didn't matter how much I trusted him.
Karlach,I heard about what happened. Ketheric. Myrkul. And Gortash. What the fuck was he doing down there? Is all of this because of him?
Karlach,Aha. I was wondering if this might come up. I've seen the two of you with your heads down more than once now. So go on. What is it.
Karlach,Mmhmm. All right. So. Go on. Finish the job.
Karlach,"All right, but who isn't? Everyone in this camp wants to climb that oak. Why are you bringing it up now?"
Karlach,"I won't know peace till I've dug my thumbs into his eyes. Till I've ripped his throat out with my teeth. Hear that, Gortash?! I'm coming for you!"
Karlach,"Sounds about right. Well, you look like you're in one piece - though just as tadpoley as ever. The search continues."
Karlach,"Embers in your shoes, huh? All right, left, right, left."
Karlach,And here I thought you had half a brain. How wrong I was!
Karlach,"You're talking about turning into, what, a half-squid?"
Karlach,Then again... you can pull it off better than most.
Karlach,You've got to be kidding. You really want me to become a partial illithid? Wasn't a decade in Avernus punishment enough?
Karlach,"What, you're going to strong-arm me, are you? I'd like to see how that ends for you."
Karlach,Where's that bloody worm? Stick it in my eye before I change my mind.
Karlach,"Ugh. I'm that easy to manipulate, am I?"
Karlach,"This isn't the way. I think you know that, deep down. You have my answer, all right?"
Karlach,Thank the gods.
Karlach,Not surprised you haven't tried it yourself yet.
Karlach,'Great powers' huh? I'm sceptical. Thought you'd be too.
Karlach,"Especially if this thing wants to turn you into, what, a half-squid?"
Karlach,Hmm. I guess the vanilla-flavoured tadpole has given us some enjoyable new tricks. But going half-mind flayer?
Karlach,"You really did it, huh? Not worried about adding more illithid into the mix?"
Karlach,And yet... you're more mind flayer than ever.
Karlach,Hope you don't expect me to follow your lead in this.
Karlach,"Special tadpole? Bit of a contradiction in terms, don't you think? I don't even want a regular one."
Karlach,"A soul coin is a... person, in a way. A lost person, mind. But something that can be put to a really good use."
Karlach,"Well... it's not the kind of thing I'd like to squander, see. "
Karlach,You're the boss. I guess.
Karlach,"Yeah. I don't think so. And if you can't understand why that bothers me so much, I think this is it for us."
Karlach,"I... think I can manage that. Just about. Will have to dig out my big girl boots, but they've got to be around here somewhere."
Karlach,Holy shit. That's my old boss - the guy who sold me to Zariel!
Karlach,"Friends, then. That'll do. Well. I should go get busy with... being your friend. Bye."
Karlach,"You sure, soldier?"
Karlach,"Let's just forget all this happened, all right? Gods! I need a drink. Badly."
Karlach,Right. Then I guess... I guess this is good-bye?
Karlach,"Do they? I'm not sure either of us can say one way or the other. We don't know what the costs might be, just yet."
Karlach,"Feels so strange coming out of my mouth. Erm. Bye, then."
Karlach,Nah. It'll be fine.
Karlach,"Sort of. Next time we find ourselves toe-to-toe with something we want to squash, drop a coin in, see what happens."
Karlach,Fuck yes - now I just need something to sink my teeth into.
Karlach,"A soul coin is a precious thing. Better used to fight evil than show off. But trust me - next time we're facing something nasty, I'll be all over 'em."
Karlach,"They're already lost. Better to be used in service of the good guys than a devil, don't you think?"
Karlach,"Next time we're in a nasty battle, drop one my way. You'll enjoy the results."
Karlach,"Like you said, a soul coin is a precious thing. I don't want to waste it showing off, but next time we're up against something nasty, I'll be all over 'em."
Karlach,"So, hey, we've got this soul coin, right? Thing is, I think I can use it. My engine can, anyway."
Karlach,Argh. How do you do that? Always making sense when I least want you to.
Karlach,"Fine. I'll keep an open mind, all right? I can promise that much."
Karlach,I don't want to get more mixed in with this mind flayer shit than I already am. Got it?
Karlach,"Damn. Bye-bye, Shadowheart. Hate to see her go, but I'm also not sure bringing her into a Sharran temple would've been the best idea for us. Or her."
Karlach,"Damn. Wish Lae'zel and Shadowheart could've solved that without coming to blows. I guess it's no surprise the githyanki warrior won out, but Shadowheart held her own."
Karlach,I'm going to miss her. She was all right.
Karlach,About what happened - about your affliction. I know you're sorry. And I know you're probably afraid it'll happen again.
Karlach,"I'll look after myself. You look after you. If we each do our part, we'll both be all right."
Karlach,It's evil in here. Let's get in and get out fast.
Karlach,"It's done, then. There's a Slayer among us."
Karlach,"So - the gith prince, huh? We've got some decisions to make."
Karlach,What the fuck is happening to us?
Karlach,I couldn't help overhearing what Elminster said to Gale. Not every day a god asks for a chat.
Karlach,Hey! Maybe I'm invited too. I can be the muscle.
Karlach,A True Soul! Play along for the minute - we can kick his arse afterward.
Karlach,Mammon! I knew it. I did!
Karlach,There we have it. A Chosen of Bhaal. An ally of Gortash. Right under my nose.
Karlach,"I want to say it doesn't make sense - but it makes perfect sense, doesn't it? I should've seen it earlier. All the signs were there."
Karlach,I don't want to talk now. Give me time. A lot of it.
Karlach,I guess all we can do is hope we all stay sane long enough to save the city.
Karlach,"Let it go? That you slept with an agent of the archdevil who ruined my life, right under my nose?"
Karlach,"The Blade of Avernus. Has a ring to it, doesn't it? Give those devils everything you've got, Wyll. You'll have 'em shaking in their boots."
Karlach,"You and your thinking. Always doing it, huh."
Karlach,You'd agree with me if that tadpole hadn't eaten the sensible part of your brain.
Karlach,"Now, are we done here?"
Karlach,"Good. And, you know, keep an eye on yourself. If you start feeling loopy, shout. We don't know what these tadpoles are capable of."
Karlach,"If you got a little boost from the tadpole, who am I to begrudge you."
Karlach,In fact... got any going spare?
Karlach,"You know, I think I would. Bit surprising, but I'm starting to see the silver lining of this whole parasite situation."
Karlach,"Greedy goblin. But all right - I'll scout out my own, if needs be."
Karlach,I can't believe Wyll's given up his soul to Zariel. For a father he fell out with ages ago. There's such a thing as being too good. Someone ought to tell Wyll Ravengard.
Karlach,I'll hold you to that.
Karlach,Glad to see you haven't gone down the tadpole-slorping route yet. We still don't know if that visitor has our best interests in mind.
Karlach,"It's a free party. But I won't lie, that's... concerning."
Karlach,Me? Nah. Nope. Sorry.
Karlach,I see you're hanging on to it there.
Karlach,"If you're not going to use it, maybe I should?"
Karlach,"Well, I am. I want to be strong...er. I want every advantage I can get."
Karlach,"Thanks, soldier. I'll use it well. Promise."
Karlach,"Heya, soldier - about that tadpole."
Karlach,"But I do have some limits. And anything in Zariel's orbit is just - no. Not ever. If I can hold you to that, we'll be all right."
Karlach,"Listen, I'm protective of your freedom, too. We're nothing without that. And I don't want to limit you. I just want to... to love you."
Karlach,And I want to try again with you. Always.
Karlach,"So there you have it. Lord Enver Gortash, in all his glory."
Karlach,What did you make of him?
Karlach,Yeah. Fucker always had expensive  taste.
Karlach,I don't know how anyone in this hall could fall for this charade. Isn't it obvious what a chancer he is?
Karlach,I guess I didn't notice 'til it was too late either.
Karlach,I wish this city - the people running it - were smarter than me. Gortash isn't their salvation. He's the monster at the gate.
Karlach,And they expect these big metal monsters to tuck them in at night while the 'Absolute' knocks on the gates.
Karlach,You were too hasty. There would've been another way. And now you've given Raphael the right to your soul.
Karlach,"Hard to explain it any other way. Then again, I guess they just want to feel safe, by any means necessary."
Karlach,Not if I get to him first.
Karlach,How can all these people cheer for him like that? Can't they see what a chancer he is?
Karlach,"Me too. Whenever you want to turn in, I'd love to take this whole touch thing for a test drive."
Karlach,I know we have important things to do - but we deserve a little sweetness too.
Karlach,"Listen. I'm never going back. If you said I could die right now or live a thousand years in the Hells, I'd choose to go out now, with my freedom intact."
Karlach,I don't expect anyone to understand that. But I've been dealt a hand most people don't have to contemplate playing. 
Karlach,You heard Dammon. There is no solution. It's Hell or bust. I choose bust.
Karlach,"He only managed it by tadpoling Duke Ravengard. Gortash doesn't play fair. If he did, he wouldn't have been able to skip to the top like this."
Karlach,Not always. Not this. I'm sorry - but this one is mine.
Karlach,You gave Raphael the right to your soul. Our hands are completely tied as long as he has that contract.
Karlach,Please! You think I'm going to let that prick have the right to your soul?
Karlach,You signed a deal with Raphael. What were you thinking?!
Karlach,"You don't really believe that. Knowing you, you thought you were making a noble sacrifice for the sake of the realm."
Karlach,"But nothing is worth your soul, Wyll. Nothing."
Karlach,Cause why would a devil ever lie to you?
Karlach,"And anyway, do you really expect him to keep his word? You think he'll stay far away from you forevermore, or will he come knocking again and again and again?"
Karlach,"As long as he has that contract, he owns you. I won't allow that."
Karlach,"We're getting that contract back. You heard him, right? It's in his gods-awful House of Hope - we need to find a way in."
Karlach,Fuck you! You've just put this entire party into terrible danger.
Karlach,"I swore I'd never return to the Hells. But for your soul, I'll make an exception. Just this once."
Karlach,"Tsh. Yeah. I mean, it's an honour. M'lady."
Karlach,"We need to talk to Helsik. She'll know how to get into that devil's lair, if she's worth her salt."
Karlach,I'm getting in. Getting your contract. And then I'm never setting foot in the hells again.
Karlach,You're letting your ignorance colour yours.
Karlach,Think again.
Karlach,It wasn't the only way. It was the only way Raphael told you about. He just wanted to get you under this thumb. And it worked.
Karlach,You are my business. End of story.
Karlach,"We need to find a diabolist. If we can find one worth their salt, they should be able to get us into that devil's lair."
Karlach,Will you stay with me? When it's time. For me to go.
Karlach,"I want to live too, but not under any circumstances. I have the power to choose, now. And I'm going to make that choice - myself."
Karlach,"And for the first time in a decade, there are people I care about all around me. Let me enjoy that. Please."
Karlach,I'm glad you trusted me enough to tell me. That means something to me.
Karlach,"Gods. Shar? She's fucking evil, Shadowheart."
Karlach,"After everything she's done to you, Wyll. How could you do it?"
Karlach,You and I both know how tricky these devilish fuckers can be.
Karlach,It's your business. But she's going to hurt you - even worse than she already has. And I don't know if I'm going to stick around to watch it happen.
Karlach,It really was. I don't know what was going through your head.
Karlach,"But I know better than anyone how tricky those devilish fuckers are. They'll make you think you're a god, 'til you wake up and find yourself face down in the mud."
Karlach,"There we have it. I'll be honest with you - I suspected as much. Wasn't sure you were going to tell me, though."
Karlach,Ugh. I wish I could say I don't understand. But I know what those tricky fuckers are like.
Karlach,Is that really how you feel?
Karlach,You have it. I don't mind who you spend your time with - but agents of Zariel are a different category.
Karlach,I care about you. I don't want you to get hurt. And I don't want to invite the Hells into our home. Not again.
Karlach,All right. Hope you burn your tongue on that devil bitch's arse. And don't come crying to me when you realise what a prick you've been.
Karlach,I'm not mad. I'm... fucking devastated.
Karlach,So. Is that it between us?
Karlach,Been there myself. What can you do except try again.
Karlach,"They'll promise you the world - make you believe it, too. Then right when you're relaxed, yoink! There goes the rug, right out from under you."
Karlach,But - I don't want to talk about this now. I've been given a huge gift - I can touch the people I love for the first time in a decade. 
Karlach,"I respect that you told me, though. Maybe the Lady of Loss doesn't have a total chokehold on you. Consider my judgement reserved."
Karlach,"Thanks for trusting me, Shadowheart. It means a lot to me that you feel I've earned it."
Karlach,Nope! Thanks so much for asking though.
Karlach,"Look, I don't want to fight. That's the exact opposite of what I want to do right now. Let's start over. Hi, I'm Karlach, and I get to touch you any time I want. How about that?"
Karlach,"Let's not fight, all right? I've just gotten a good turn. I want to ride that 'til the wagon wheels fly off."
Karlach,"Thanks, soldier. I just want to celebrate this. At least for a little."
Karlach,"Thank you, I try."
Karlach,"Thanks, soldier. Your support means I've got one less thing to worry about. That means a lot to me."
Karlach,You really are the best of the best. Of the best.
Karlach,I can see you're a good person. But good people can do terrible things if they get mixed up in the wrong situation.
Karlach,"I'm so happy for me too! Now I just need to find someone to cuddle up to tonight, and I'll be the happiest woman on the Sword Coast."
Karlach,Well. Yes you did.
Karlach,"Sorry, I'm just... I mean, it's not that I didn't suspect... but... now here it is. In the open."
Karlach,"I... guess I'm glad you told me. If you were a dyed-in-the-wool evil Sharran skulker, you'd've kept that close to the chest."
Karlach,"I won't lie, this makes me a little uneasy. But I've met far worse operators than you, Shadowheart."
Karlach,Consider my judgement reserved. For now.
Karlach,I'll be honest - I suspected as much. I was hoping you'd tell me yourself. And hey! You did.
Karlach,"To be honest, I don't know much about Shar. About what her followers believe and don't believe. But if they're mostly like you... well, maybe Shar's gotten an unfair reputation."
Karlach,"Withers was giving me the old eye the other night. Then again, maybe it was just an old eye."
Karlach,Let me transform. I'm... I'm not long for this world. I can feel it. 
Karlach,Speaking of which. There's something I wanted to ask you.
Karlach,"But that's not in the stars for us, my love. Ours is a short story with a few good twists - and a banger of an ending."
Karlach,"I'll tell you all about it, after we've taken down those 'paladins' I'm after. Believe me - it's worth the wait."
Karlach,"Let's hope Dammon is as good as he seems. Once my engine's handled, I can focus on more important matters - tadpoles, cults, frosty pints..."
Karlach,That's the short of it. Bloody thing's been in overdrive since I left Avernus.
Karlach,I can be close to you now. Without fear. Without thinking too hard. We can just... be.
Karlach,"No more than anyone else. Well. Maybe slightly more. But that's the past now. I'm free. More free than I've ever been, now."
Karlach,Like I got something back - something I've wanted for a really long time.
Karlach,"When you put your hand on me, I was finally a closed circuit. Complete."
Karlach,"When you kissed me, I was... I don't know if I have the words."
Karlach,"My heart was racing, but I didn't hurt you. I don't have to be afraid of myself anymore."
Karlach,I don't have to hold back.
Karlach,"Not sure the world's ready for unleashed Karlach, but it's getting it anyway. Thanks to Dammon. Thanks to you. Thanks to fate."
Karlach,"Ugh, I don't want to think about that now."
Karlach,"Misery always overstays its welcome. And joy leaves too soon. I'll cry later, but not now."
Karlach,"TOUCH! Touch everything. Touch everyone that'll let me. Shake hands. Dance a waltz. Maybe even kiss a face or two, if I find a good candidate."
Karlach,The world's my funhouse.
Karlach,Old Rusty? Sure.
Karlach,It's a long story. But a good one.
Karlach,"Help me kill those Paladins of Tyr, and I'll tell you. A bit of good gossip for your good help."
Karlach,Felt good letting off a little steam after facing off with this ignots.
Karlach,"Won't be seeing my mechanic any time soon, so I'll just make the most of the extra heat. Just don't get too close 'til I've found a way to calm it down."
Karlach,"But it's a bit early in the game to be getting into tragic backstories. Let's save the scar-show for later, after we've worked up an appetite for tragedy."
Karlach,"The first time I faced down those 'paladins,' they let slip there was an infernal mechanic in the area. A tiefling. He might be able to stabilise things - if I can find him."
Karlach,"A weaponsmith, huh? Not sure if he's the guy, but I'd love to find out. A tune-up would do this rusty heart a world of good."
Karlach,"Sounds like a good lead. Hopefully, our guy will be among them. A tune-up would do this old tub a world of good."
Karlach,Thanking you. A tune-up would give this rustbox of mine a new lease on life.
Karlach,Let's go find your friend before I blow a gasket. Lead on!
Karlach,"Me too, soldier. Gods! Me too. For every knock we take, I feel like I get a little treat just to keep me going. "
Karlach,Engine heats up the whole system enough not to get burned. Hopefully it'll hold together long enough to get tuned up.
Karlach,Hopefully it'll hold together long enough to get tuned up.
Karlach,"Let's move, eh? I'm running high and in the mood for a fight."
Karlach,You... did? Wow. That was sound of you. Why'd you do it?
Karlach,Glad to be counted among them. Really glad.
Karlach,You're my kind of people. 
Karlach,"Then again, facing 'em down might've put my tin can into overdrive."
Karlach,"Thanks to you, I'll live to fight another day. And get this bloody thing tuned up."
Karlach,"Nope. Not sure how good it is for the gears, either."
Karlach,"Incredible, right? Keep 'em coming. I can handle it."
Karlach,"I'm just happy to know someone can do something about this little situation. Thought I was alone but I'm not, am I?"
Karlach,With your help - and Dammon's - I might be able to get a little more control over this thing. None too soon either - it's starting to wear me out a bit.
Karlach,"She put this thing in my chest and set me to work. Well, to war. I learned quick how to stay alive. And the engine served me when it came to killing devils."
Karlach,It's not too late to stop the cult from using these things. Now's our chance to change them - or fry 'em.<br>
Karlach,Look at all those tads. Enough to make an army of Absolutists.
Karlach,Ten years of that. The stories I could tell.
Karlach,Guy named Gortash. Politician. Inventor. One of these wheeler-dealer types who seems to have a finger in every pie.
Karlach,I guess I was naive to think everything he got up to was above board. What did I know? I saw a job - a good job - with people I liked doing work I was good at.
Karlach,"Sometimes I'm jealous of that girl. Ugh, to feel so invincible again."
Karlach,"Through the jigs and the reels, he made a deal with Zariel behind my back. You know Zariel, right? Archdevil of Avernus? "
Karlach,"I'll mete out the best ones, bit by bit, so you always have a reason to keep me around. Clever, right?"
Karlach,"Sharp instincts, sharp weapons, and a knack for improvisation. That's the only way to survive 'em."
Karlach,That's what I call an invitation. Let's find Z'rell and get this caravan moving.
Karlach,"Anyway, what were we talking about?"
Karlach,The two of them conspired to give me a little gift.
Karlach,"Hmm. I don't think so. At least, I still remember everything - in more detail than I'd wish."
Karlach,"But as for what's going on in your mind, and maybe in mine... I'm certain there are answers out there. We'll find them together."
Karlach,"I'll look after myself. You look after you. If we each do our part, we'll both be all right. I promise."
Karlach,"Depends on the type. Ice devils hate an inferno, but that's an easy one. Orthons love projectiles - what they don't love is getting their bombs lobbed right back in their faces. "
Karlach,Granted the fire lasted a little longer than it should.
Karlach,I was a kid looking for a way to fill my days and make some cash when I fell into the wrong crowd. Worked for a guy I respected. A lot. Turns out the feeling wasn't mutual.
Karlach,"The year? Ten ere. The place? A sleepy little town called Baldur's Gate. Our hero? Karlach, a knock-kneed delinquent from the Outer City with everything to give and nothing to lose."
Karlach,"Hold on, soldier. We don't stand a chance against this mob. We'll have our moment, but this isn't it."
Karlach,"You did the right thing. I'm sure those nasties deserved a bollocking, but we're no executioners. Let's go see what Z'rell makes of it."
Karlach,"Well. That's done with. Might as well go say hello to Z'rell, then."
Karlach,"I try not to think about it. I still think about it constantly, but, you know, I try."
Karlach,Oh my gods. I'm gonna faint!
Karlach,Is that... the Beloved Ranger? Jaheira is gonna burst! I'm gonna burst. Oh my gods - Minsc!
Karlach,"One of these days I'll sort the whole infernal affair out, get myself cooled off, and start making up for lost time."
Karlach,Half-dead and still a servant. My worst nightmare.
Karlach,But! Not today.
Karlach,"You've never met anyone so desperate for a hug as this one right here. Pathetic, perhaps, but true. It's my lot to bear, and I bear it badly."
Karlach,"Ah well. Can't have it all, can you. Not today, at least."
Karlach,I'd trade you if I could. I miss it more than anything.
Karlach,But hey. That's life. Or so I'm told.
Karlach,Phew. Had to let off a little steam after facing off with those ignots.
Karlach,"Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you are."
Karlach,Why not. Let me see if I can paint you a picture.
Karlach,Agonising! Gods! What I wouldn't give for a hug. A pat! Anything!
Karlach,"That's a heavy weight. I know you can carry it, but it's heavy all the same."
Karlach,What about it? Had to let off a little steam after facing off with those ignots.
Karlach,"Careful, soldier. If I burn any hotter, I might explode."
Karlach,"Fair enough. But I hope you know by now that I'm on your side. Anyone tries to hurt you, and they'll have to answer to the big mad furnace."
Karlach,"No more secrets, all right? We're in this together-together."
Karlach,I can live with that.
Karlach,You're very annoying. But I'm sure you know that.
Karlach,"Sure, in the beginning, but this isn't the beginning anymore, is it?"
Karlach,"I have to be able to trust you too, you know. No more secrets, all right?"
Karlach,Now that's what I call an abdomen.
Karlach,"He sounds like a real prick. Well listen, Astarion - they aren't here now. And if they should their ugly face, I'll crack it open. All right?"
Karlach,"You're a bad liar. Strange, for a vamp. Your kind usually sweat charm."
Karlach,The Absolute fairly ripped your hand off. That's no way to tempt us into a meeting.
Karlach,Hello?! Hey! Snap out of it!
Karlach,Let me try it next time. Looked fun.
Karlach,"I guess I can't blame you for being cautious. If anything, it proves you're a good ally."
Karlach,"We can't help who we are. Or what's been done to us. All we have is what we do now. And from what I can tell, you're sound enough for me."
Karlach,Nice try.
Karlach,Why didn't you tell me sooner? 
Karlach,"Did you really think you could hide what you are from me forever, vampire?"
Karlach,Gotta be a Moonlantern. Just what we need.
Karlach,Fuck yes - let's do it! I want to crush something evil.
Karlach,"So you're a vampire, then. I had my suspicions."
Karlach,"If that were true, you wouldn't have been feeding in our camp!"
Karlach,Phew. This place is... heavy.
Karlach,"Impressed with myself. I slept like a baby, even after your little display."
Karlach,Sometimes I think I'd sleep through the apocalypse.
Karlach,You're lucky I can handle your bullshit.
Karlach,You're welcome.
Karlach,"Look, if you don't trust me, that's on you. I've been straightforward this whole time. About who I am, about what I need."
Karlach,"If you're sure about that, then I'm sure about you."
Karlach,Stand by me if you need to keep warm in this awful place.
Karlach,New day ahead of us. Let's put this knew knowledge to good use in the fight against evil.
Karlach,The vampire wakes.
Karlach,I hope last night's little display was a one-time thing. 
Karlach,"Lucky for you, I'm very forgiving of mistakes."
Karlach,"Phew. This place is dark beyond dark. You feel it too, right? I'm sticking to light wherever I can find it."
Karlach,"All right, Astarion. It's time we had the talk."
Karlach,"Getting caught red-fanged hasn't humbled you much, I see."
Karlach,Keep your secrets if you want. But you may not have someone to tell them to if you keep it up.
Karlach,There it is. I was hoping you'd tell me yourself. I'm glad - very glad - you trusted me with this.
Karlach,"I didn't know for sure, of course. But between the fangs and the red eyes and the timeless wit, I had my inklings."
Karlach,"This doesn't feel right. I don't know what else to do, but still..."
Karlach,"Hanging out in his playhouse has my hackles up, sure, but... but I've got this."
Karlach,Let's find that hammer and get out of here before I get used to feeling like I might live.
Karlach,"Gods, I can't believe I'm doing this. This is all your fault, you know."
Karlach,You're lucky I love you.
Karlach,"Get in, get the contract, and go. Easy."
Karlach,We won't get trapped here. We won't get dragged deeper into Avernus. We won't.
Karlach,"Seven thousand vampire spawns, unleashed on the Sword Coast. It'll be a well-dressed flood of mayhem, at least."
Karlach,"Speaking of, my engine is feeling pretty... normal. Like it isn't about to explode. I gotta admit, that's pretty nice."
Karlach,"Yes. How hard can it be, stealing an asset from a devil's stronghold?"
Karlach,You're lucky I care about the fate of your eternal soul.
Karlach,"You bet your arse I am. And good friends don't let good friends get trapped in the Hells, right? "
Karlach,Phew. I gotta admit. That's pretty nice.
Karlach,Had to let off a little steam after facing off with those ignots.
Karlach,Granted the fire's lasting a little longer than it should. How do I look?
Karlach,"Honey, I could go all night."
Karlach,Let's find that contract and get out of here before I get used to feeling like I might live.
Karlach,"Who, me? This is the best day I've had in years."
Karlach,"Yeah, right. I want that hammer as much as you do. And I'm not afraid of Raphael."
Karlach,"Get in, get the hammer, and go. Easy."
Karlach,"We're good, right? "
Karlach,'Happy' might be pushing it. But we make a formidable group. No sense breaking it up yet.
Karlach,You bet your arse I am.
Karlach,Let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Only got room for so much drama at a time.
Karlach,Anything else?
Karlach,"We're all a little complicated, aren't we? It's a bit of a race to the top of complication mountain, at this point."
Karlach,Don't worry. I'll stomp him. Guaranteed.
Karlach,Ugh! Let's just find that fucking hammer and get out of here fast.
Karlach,"If he lays a finger on you, I'll break it off. That's a promise."
Karlach,"Luckily I'm not the type to hold someone's past against them. As long as I can trust you, I don't care what you are."
Karlach,"Knew there was something off about you. That you might be a vamp entered my mind, for sure."
Karlach,I had my suspicions. Would've helped if you'd told me sooner. But it is what it is.
Karlach,"Huh. Back in the hells, but not a devil in sight. This is so... strange."
Karlach,"On the bright side, my engine finally feels... normal. Like it isn't about to explode."
Karlach,Pity it doesn't last outside this hole.
Karlach,"Gods, I can't believe I'm doing this. We're going to get out of here - right?"
Karlach,I'm glad you told me. Thought maybe you were going to keep it a secret forever.
Karlach,You are so much more than your parents; you're more than the affliction that wants to consume you.
Karlach,"You are my friend. And you get to choose your destiny. Choose well, all right? Please."
Karlach,I love you. And I know you'll choose your destiny - and choose it well. You will... won't you?
Karlach,"My family home's long gone, but I'll show you my favourite chowhall in the city, if it's still standing."
Karlach,"I can picture you getting mixed up in some outrageous shit. Giants, beholders, Thayans, the works."
Karlach,"Maybe once we've wrapped up the current shenanigans, we'll rest a bit and find some new heap of trouble to throw ourselves at."
Karlach,Lucky you. Sometimes I think I'd be better off indulging in a bit of light oblivion.
Karlach,"Well. We may as well make some good memories mixed in with the body horror, eh?"
Karlach,He got his claws into me early. I was a wild kid - brawling my way through the city.
Karlach,"One of my mates got wind of a bit of work guarding some indoorsy type with lots of enemies. Seemed like easy money, so I went in for it."
Karlach,"I respected him. Trusted him. And he returned that trust, that respect. His life was in my hands, and I took that seriously."
Karlach,"The whole thing with Zariel happened so fast. I had no idea what had gone down until it was over. One minute I was in Baldur's Gate, a happy, healthy not-quite-kid. The next, I was burning up in Avernus with an engine for a heart."
Karlach,"Ahh, it smells so good here!"
Karlach,"He was right. Sometimes I wished he weren't. Evil, evil bastard."
Karlach,"You saw the extent of Flo's friendship. She'll lend you a hand, long as she can crush your spirit while she's at it."
Karlach,"I knew never to let my guard down around her. But she always made me laugh, even when I least wanted to."
Karlach,"If she'd been completely different from who she was, we might've been real friends."
Karlach,Nothing worth reading. Cambion manipulation at its most obvious.
Karlach,"Ah man, lucky you. That's the dream. Maybe when this is all done, you can show me where you came from."
Karlach,I get the feeling we've got a long road ahead of us. I hope we find you some answers along the way.
Karlach,"It'll come back to you. Maybe you'll recognise something we pass, or maybe we'll find out what happened to you."
Karlach,Living a normal lifespan is so yesterday. Believe me.
Karlach,"I keep going over what I'd have done diffferently, if I had the chance. We could've just done exactly what Mizora said. Bought ourselves a little time to get Wyll free."
Karlach,I was so certain I didn't want to do anything that'd help Zariel. But I was wrong.
Karlach,We failed him. I failed him. I just can't forgive myself for that.
Karlach,Funny you should ask. I was just thinking about what would've become of us without that nautiloid.
Karlach,"I mean, I know where I'd be. Trapped in Avernus still, with the Blade of Frontiers on my tail. But what about you?"
Karlach,"Good old Lady Shar. Fair enough. I probably would've been stuck serving an evil mistress too, if I'm honest."
Karlach,"I know we're different, but I'm glad that mad ship brought us together. Who knows where we'll end up?"
Karlach,And a devil will never not break your heart.
Karlach,"I wonder if we ever crossed paths in the Gate. We would've been a lot younger, but I feel like yours is a face I wouldn't easily forget."
Karlach,Happy the nautiloid intervened before we snapped each others' necks.
Karlach,"Now there's a sight I'd like to see. The great Lae'zel climbing a mind flayer like a scorpion, taking it down with one fatal strike."
Karlach,You'd be magnificent.
Karlach,"It's hard to picture, honestly. That Cazador could never beat you in a fair fight."
Karlach,Not the Astarion I know.
Karlach,"I'd like to have joined you there. Roaring fire, frosty drink, a bard in the corner..."
Karlach,"We have more in common than I knew. I won't pry for details. Right now, at least."
Karlach,"Wonder if you would've caught me. Would we have figured it all out, come to terms, or would it have been a case of last lunkhead standing?"
Karlach,I guess she did. Much as it makes me want to puke to admit it.
Karlach,"Devils, you know? Fucking devils. They really screw with you, don't they?"
Karlach,"Maybe someday, anyway."
Karlach,"Yeah! Let's go straight there. Whatever those fucks are getting up to, it's nothing good. "
Karlach,"Hey, soldier. You're back."
Karlach,Old habits. Did I miss anything while I was off having a sulk?
Karlach,"I missed you too. You know, I wouldn't have bothered falling in love with you if I'd known saying goodbye would be so hard."
Karlach,You certainly are.
Karlach,"I'm trying to stay here, now, alive, while I can. But it's like my mind is whittled down to the black hole that should've been our future."
Karlach,"Ugh, I'm sorry. I don't want you to be sad. I mean, I do. But not too sad."
Karlach,"A cambion, you won't be surprised to hear. I knew never to let my guard down around her. But the fucker made me laugh. Even - especially - when I least felt like it."
Karlach,Oh no - definitely something up with this one. Trust me.
Karlach,"Haha! In every blister, there I'll be."
Karlach,"Ah, honey. I hope you miss me, but not too much. You have a gift in front of you: A whole life. You have to savour it. Promise?"
Karlach,Good. I know I can trust you to keep your word on that.
Karlach,"Wow. Gods - you're so right. And we are beautiful, aren't we. This is - it's everything."
Karlach,"I probably would've exploded somewhere around Scornubel, so at least your trip home would be short."
Karlach,I don't want to leave you behind. Not ever.
Karlach,"If I had my choice, we'd do it all together. Life - a long life. And then we'd slip away one night, side by side, wrinkled and grey, warm in our bed."
Karlach,I know I can count on you.
Karlach,I don't know. You'd think she'd have more important things to do. Devils and their pride.
Karlach,"You saw the extent of Florenta the Garroter's friendship. She'll lend you a hand, long as she can crush your spirit while she's at it."
Karlach,I should've looked after the Elturans more - gone out of my way to make sure they were all right.
Karlach,"Thank the gods. And I do, every day."
Karlach,"Mizora. She lives off crumbs from Zariel's table. I've always hated the lick-arse. Obviously, the feeling is mutual."
Karlach,"Thank the gods it's over, I say. My last trip to the Hells ever, ever."
Karlach,"No such thing as a home in the Hells. If Hope's happy, good for her. But mark my words, some devil or other will push in and claim the place sooner or later."
Karlach,"Stick around in Avernus long enough, and you'll run out of hope entirely."
Karlach,"No, soldier, I'd rather live out my days in the world I love than live forever in a world I hate."
Karlach,"I don't know much, but I do know that."
Karlach,"The long and short of it was I didn't want to risk my neck. I let them get on with the nightmare, same as I had to."
Karlach,"No, kid. No."
Karlach,"Right you are. Got what we came for, and then some."
Karlach,NEVER EVER. I mean it. That was my last hurrah in that hole for good.
Karlach,"Engine's running like a bat out of Avernus again, though. Gods, I almost forgot how hot this thing is."
Karlach,Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Probably.
Karlach,I don't know what I was expecting. Something beyond-real.
Karlach,Maybe in the next life.
Karlach,"Wasn't all that long ago. I never knew the whole of how and why, but I remember the devils slavering with delight."
Karlach,What's going on here?
Karlach,"I guess that's good news, right? Maybe Zariel's found some other poor sap to occupy her interest."
Karlach,"I'm sure when Zariel gave her the order to hunt me down, Mizora was delighted."
Karlach,"But she favoured me like a child favours a captive pet. Mizora envied the attention, I suppose."
Karlach,So Gortash is a lord now. I'd like to clap eyes on this Steel Watch of his.
Karlach,You already know the story. I was Gortash's body guard - loyal as they come - when he made the deal with Zariel. She got a test subject for her infernal engine. I never found out what he got.
Karlach,This is the kind of man who gets a title. Authority. Makes me sick.
Karlach,"No. But they always seem to get it, don't they."
Karlach,"You know what? It probably is. Man has a talent for nuts and bolts. Weapons, too. Hopefully, whatever he's made really is helping defend the city."
Karlach,"I'm sure there's a catch, but I guess we'll find out when we get to the city - home. Gods, I can't wait. Even Gortash can't spoil that."
Karlach,"I never really told you the story of me and Gortash, did I? Let me set the stage."
Karlach,Thankfully.
Karlach,I was a kid looking for a way to fill my days and make some cash when I fell into the wrong crowd. Gortash. I respected him so much at the time. Turns out the feeling wasn't mutual.
Karlach,"A... technique I learned. From one of Zariel's clerics. But it's nothing scary, I promise."
Karlach,"See, they could look into someone's eyes and tell if they were lying or speaking true. More useful than torture and totally painless."
Karlach,"They taught me a thing or two, but I haven't practised in a good long while. I'm curious to see if my chops are still choppy."
Karlach,Just stand comfortably. Look me in the eyes. And...
Karlach,What is your name?
Karlach,"Funny. I know you're telling the truth, but I'm sensing something different. Let me try something else."
Karlach,You speak true. I know you do. But I'm sensing something different. Let me try something else.
Karlach,She put this thing in my chest and set me to work. I never found out what Gortash got in exchange.
Karlach,Appropriate and understandable.
Karlach,"Let's find that infernal iron and see if you've changed your tune. I'm used to winning, I'll have you know."
Karlach,"Don't tease me, my lonesome heart can't take it!"
Karlach,I'm glad. I've been worried about you.
Karlach,Hit me.
Karlach,If you say so.
Karlach,"Well look. You've said it, right out loud. That takes guts. The guts you'll need to change."
Karlach,"Or at least make sure you're channelled in the right direction. We've got enough enemies who could do with a good blood-letting, you know."
Karlach,I don't think I've ever felt more powerful.
Karlach,Bring it on.
Karlach,Looks like a long way down. Shall I go first?
Karlach,Oh fuck yes. I'm ready to burn all night.
Karlach,That's what I like to hear.
Karlach,Now - let's trot! Standing still is making my skin itch.
Karlach,I can't tell if you're flirting or threatening me. I'll take either one.
Karlach,Do you want to?
Karlach,"I'd like that. Now - let's find that infernal iron, before I overheat."
Karlach,Hah! I'd kick your arse - but I think we'd both enjoy the process.
Karlach,Let's find that infernal iron so we can fight it out.
Karlach,"Speaking of, I could eat a giant badger. Is it almost time for dinner?"
Karlach,"You know, I think you might be right."
Karlach,"Good stories, good sex, life itself - they all share the element of unpredictability. Settle in!"
Karlach,"Strange question. You have to tell the truth. But you can't, really. Nor I. You're just like me. And everyone we know."
Karlach,"It's suddenly obvious. I do as I'm told, don't I. Don't I? Or..."
Karlach,"Torm, Lathandar, Beshaba, Mystra. Are these their names? Are we sure of that? "
Karlach,It isn't that. That's not a real spell. None of these spells are real. We're just enzymes in a great churning bath...
Karlach,"All right, let's see if we can shake things up, then."
Karlach,You can have a snack when I'm finished with you.
Karlach,"Whatever you say, soldier. I'll have to find another amenable soul for my fiendish experimentations..."
Karlach,"Haha! Stupid. Come on, for real this time."
Karlach,I'm finally seeing. I see it all.
Karlach,"Pretty, gorgeous please?"
Karlach,"Excellent. It's risk-free, I promise. Something I picked up from one of Zariel's clerics."
Karlach,"Let me explain. It's a technique I picked up from one of Zariel's clerics - used to elicit the truth from subjects. Totally painless, totally risk-free."
Karlach,"I haven't practised in a good long while, though. I'm curious if I can still pull it off."
Karlach,"It's not that I want to collect them, per se. It's just that if we should happen upon them, I can use them in battle to fire up my engine."
Karlach,"Evil's evil, but it can be put to good use. Sometimes. Maybe. Right?"
Karlach,We were both part of Zariel's inner circle. Her by choice. Me by force.
Karlach,"In the grand scheme of things, I'm inconsequential to Zariel. Sure, I've got the engine. But I wasn't even her strongest fighter."
Karlach,Fair enough! I'll drop the subject. Maybe someone else would be willing to give it a shot...
Karlach,"Now, next question. The next question I have for you is... is... hello? What's happening here?"
Karlach,No. Don't you see? This is it. The truth behind our truth.
Karlach,"You speak like you know. But you don't know. They know. And I think I know, now, too."
Karlach,I don't think it has. I think... I think it's truly worked for the first time.
Karlach,"I see... a great web. Intersecting lines - permutations - and behind them, chaos. And then the hand that decides: yes, no. But it barely knows itself."
Karlach,"Tell me - tell me now. Do you know how all of this ends? You, me, this adventure?"
Karlach,Have you gotten there before?
Karlach,It's like you've done this before. Have you?
Karlach,I knew it. You just want to go where you've been. But you never can; I never can. We're stuck here in the future. Together.
Karlach,"I'm so jealous. I'm stuck here, forever here. In these tangled lines, in these hundred hours, or less, or more..."
Karlach,I want to know what's coming. I want to know how this will end. Have you done this before?
Karlach,"You're having fun, aren't you?"
Karlach,Gods! I should hope so.
Karlach,"I don't think so, soldier. I feel fine! Might've gotten lost in the moment but believe me, I'm me."
Karlach,"Careful now or I'll subject you to more devilish parlour tricks. I know how to make a copper piece appear from behind your ear, you know."
Karlach,"Ouch. Sorry. If I'd realised you'd end up in such a snit, I wouldn't have asked."
Karlach,Hope you can squeeze a nap in - you need it.
Karlach,That's good enough for me.
Karlach,At least we can do it together. The hidden joys. The little secrets.
Karlach,Phew! That was wild. Thanks for playing along.
Karlach,It's just so godsdamned beautiful here.
Karlach,This is it. This is what we worked so hard for.
Karlach,"Reckon it's time we talked about all this fire, huh? I've got an infernal engine for a heart. Little gift from Zariel."
Karlach,How would you feel about helping me kill some evil bastards?
Karlach,"A little background, if your moral compass needs something to point at..."
Karlach,Turns out I've got a knack for killing demons. That made me a valuable asset. Zariel - the archdevil herself - made me as her personal attack dog.
Karlach,"I played along until I could get the fuck out of there, but devils don't like to lose their assets."
Karlach,"Zariel liked it so little, she sent a bunch of goons, so-called 'Paladins of Tyr' after me. Until a minute ago, I thought you were working with them. They want to take me back to the Hells."
Karlach,But believe me when I say I'd rather die.
Karlach,"Fuck yes. They cornered me outside the tollhouse, just up the hill. Doubt they've gone far after the scorching I gave 'em."
Karlach,Then we can work on evicting this parasite and take Faerûn by the short hairs. Sound good?
Karlach,I'd hug you if it wouldn't scorch your skin off. 
Karlach,"If this is really goodbye, soldier, I guess... well... thanks for everything. I'd hoped we'd be able to stick together a bit longer, but that's life, isn't it."
Karlach,"Trust me - when you see what I'm capable of, you won't regret it."
Karlach,"I may not be a devil, but I can put that reputation of yours to work."
Karlach,"Don't worry, I'll lead the charge. But I could use your help. There's a lot of them and only one of me. After that, we can team up. Take Faerûn by the short hairs. Sound good?"
Karlach,"Dirty work's the only kind I like. But there are a lot of them and just the one of me. I'll take point, and you flank 'em."
Karlach,"After that, we can team up. Take Faerûn by the short hairs. Sound good?"
Karlach,"That's incredible! In that case, you ought to let me return the favour. My muscle for your aid in my battle against the powers of the arch-bitch."
Karlach,Wheey! Now we're talking.
Karlach,Why don't you clear things with your leader before we team up. Send 'em my way so we can work out the particulars.
Karlach,"If there's one thing Zariel taught me, it's not to fuck with the top dog until it's absolutely necessary."
Karlach,"Hang on, though - looks like you've got enough backup at your side. Not sure there's room for me."
Karlach,"I'll catch up with you when it's time to camp, for now. But don't get to any of the fun stuff without me - got it?"
Karlach,"Phew, I'm getting all het up. Let's make tracks!"
Karlach,"Damn. After a decade in hell, I was hoping for a little company. Even a big hero once out for my head."
Karlach,But I can take a hint. Good luck out there. You're gonna need it.
Karlach,Dirty work's the only kind I like. Gets even messier the more bodies you throw at it. Think of the potential.
Karlach,"You did?! That's incredible! You ought to let me return the favour. We can team up - evict this parasite, then take Faerûn by the short hairs. Sound good?"
Karlach,What say we take our mind off things with a little fun?
Karlach,"Thank the gods, he sees sense! Look, Blade - Wyll - I know you love bashing evil - we have that in common."
Karlach,Can't wait to be home. Anything that comes after that is extra.
Karlach,"Bit sweaty, but up for whatever's next. Thanks, soldier."
Karlach,But look - we've just about made it to the city. That'll do me. Let's go protect it. Whatever happens after that is between me and the so-called gods.
Karlach,"I want us both to be ready if... well, if we can't fix me."
Karlach,I think this might be it. Soon. Thing's burning hotter than I knew it could.
Karlach,"Ngh, soldier, my engine. It hurts."
Karlach,"We all have our shit to bear. As long you remember your manners, Astarion, you're welcome at my fire."
Karlach,"Some of us more than others, but - yes."
Karlach,Ngh...
Karlach,"We've both got a brain-worm. I know you can see into my mind, see the truth. I'm home now - out of the Hells. I just want to live."
Karlach,"Please. It's Wyll, right? We don't have to do this."
Karlach,Erm... are you all right?
Karlach,Thank the gods. Thought I was going to have to take your head.
Karlach,"Look - you don't have to trust me blindly. I'll prove to you I'm as clean as they come. In fact, we're in the same line of work, in a way."
Karlach,I'd like to team up. Send your leader my way so we can work out the particulars.
Karlach,"I think I told you to get the fuck out of my face, for your own good."
Karlach,I can explain. But it's a whole situation. 
Karlach,Fuck...
Karlach,"I never wanted to serve Zariel. I was enlisted in her army against my will. Forced to fight, and fight I did."
Karlach,"When I saw an opportunity to get away, I took it. I'm finally home - or near it, anyway."
Karlach,"And you almost seem sensible. On my heart, I'm telling you the truth."
Karlach,I want us both to live. That's all.
Karlach,"Whatever the consequences may be, we'll face them together. If you'll have me."
Karlach,"Whatever that price may be, I'll help you pay it. We'll be in this together."
Karlach,"Truce then, hey?"
Karlach,"With this heat going, I can't spare the energy to think. I just want to enjoy whatever's left of this life of mine."
Karlach,"I can see that. But look, if we take care of my little problem, we can move on to yours next. and the tadpole after that."
Karlach,"I understand, but hear me out. These fucks will be especially fun to hunt."
Karlach,I can explain. But it's a whole situation. If you'd just hear me out -
Karlach,"You saw the truth. I never wanted to serve Zariel. I was enlisted in her army against my will. Forced to fight, and fight I did."
Karlach,I've figured it out. Exactly what I want to do with you.
Karlach,"Listen to sense, now. I don't want this to end badly for either of us."
Karlach,I'm Karlach - but you already knew that. And you are...?
Karlach,"Well met, soldier. Nice to meet a friendly around here - it's been tough going so far."
Karlach,"I may not be a devil, but I can put the Blade's reputation to work."
Karlach,"Now that we're old pals, how would you feel about helping me kill some evil bastards?"
Karlach,"I want to go on a date. A first date. No weapons, no monsters, no mysterious voices... just you and me and dinner."
Karlach,Please say yes.
Karlach,"Yes! Amazing. Put on your least bloody tunic and meet me back here. Eee, I'm so excited!"
Karlach,Touch me and you'll regret it.
Karlach,Give me a beat to run ahead - I want to make sure everything's absolutely perfect. See you there!
Karlach,You look nice.
Karlach,And never forget it.
Karlach,"I refuse to find out you're an arsehole at this late juncture, so I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that."
Karlach,Hmm. Baldurian seafood stew. No thank you. What do you think you'll have?
Karlach,Maybe I shouldn't knock what I haven't tried.
Karlach,"We'll both have the seafood stew, please. And two glasses of..."
Karlach,...and two glasses of beer.
Karlach,...and two glasses of wine.
Karlach,"Eh. Bad-ish. Not trying to one-up the local villains, of course, but man, have I seen some shit."
Karlach,"But hang on, this isn't first date talk. Tonight, I'm a mystery to you, and you're a mystery to me."
Karlach,"It's all I can do to keep my hands to myself, anyway. We're terrible at this."
Karlach,Hi. Hi! You made it.
Karlach,"Kill some fiends, evict a parasite, then take Faerûn by the short hairs. Sound good?"
Karlach,"This is cute. I'm still going to cave your murderous heads in, but it's nice to get a peek at the inside drama first."
Karlach,"Tsk. That was pathetic - it really was. How said that shitty lie will be the last thing you say. Bye, fucker. You too, Blade."
Karlach,"I won't pester you for details now, but believe me Wyll, I'll be there by your side, whatever comes."
Karlach,"That sounds serious. But look, Wyll, you won't face it alone. Whatever it is. I owe you that much."
Karlach,Maybe I could even show you a little fun before the hammer falls.
Karlach,"Thank the gods. I would've taken no pleasure in burning you to a crisp. Well, not much anyway."
Karlach,"And look - you don't have to trust me blindly. I'll prove to you I'm as clean as they come. In fact, we're in the same line of work, in a way."
Karlach,"The tadpole. Gods, there's more to this thing than I realised."
Karlach,"Well, whatever else it may be, the tadpole isn't a liar. I never wanted to serve Zariel, and I escaped the first chance I could."
Karlach,Good luck. I'm gonna miss you. You better miss me too. Or else.
Karlach,"For shit's sake, you must be half troll to possess a skull that thick."
Karlach,"Well, well, well. How the Blade of Frontiers has changed."
Karlach,Were all those people Zariel's servants too? Or is it possible you're going after the wrong people.
Karlach,"As for the Blade of Frontiers - you fashion yourself a hero, but you lie down with dogs like this. That's just pathetic."
Karlach,I guess it doesn't matter now. Your trail of blood ends here and now.
Karlach,"Tsk. That was pathetic - it really was. How said that shitty lie will be the last thing you say. Bye, Blade."
Karlach,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? Set down my blade and watch as you plunge yours in my heart. Not a chance. I intend to live - over your dead body."
Karlach,"Argh! You back away first, all right? One false move, and you're dead. I've more important things to do today than kill a rat."
Karlach,"Oh, I want to live. Just not in a world with you in it."
Karlach,"I need to be alone, all right? I'm very fucking confused right now."
Karlach,"Try, motherfucker! See what happens!"
Karlach,Tell it to their corpses. Murderer.
Karlach,You suppose right. Not that it matters anymore. You're too dangerous - I've got to put a stop to you.
Karlach,With pleasure.
Karlach,Please. The only devils here are you lot.
Karlach,You're not the worst liar I've ever met. But you're daft as a brick if you think I'm going to believe that.
Karlach,That's a load of shit. But you know what? Vengeance can wait. And I have other priorities today.
Karlach,"Anyway, it could be worse. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. With who I'm meant to be with. How many people can say that?"
Karlach,These pricks deserve it more than anyone you've ever met.
Karlach,"Pity. I could've used a friend. But if you choose to lie down with devils, you wake up with my boot in your arse."
Karlach,Gortash?! He can't possibly be involved in this...
Karlach,This handwriting looks familiar...
Karlach,What was Flo doing here?
Karlach,"Let's have the soul coins, then."
Karlach,Did Flo have anything else for me?
Karlach,"Fine. Get on with it, then."
Karlach,Thanks. I'll put it to better use than Tiamat would have.
Karlach,I'll put his coin to good use. He'll help me rid the Realms of people like Zariel.
Karlach,"Thanks, Flo. Hearing all these stories has ruined my day, which I suppose was the point."
Karlach,That's it?
Karlach,Hear that? Infernal engine for a heart. Lets me burn as hot as the Hells. Thing's been running in overdrive since I left Avernus.
Karlach,"Go on then, Gale. We'll be here waiting for you when you're finished."
Karlach,It's important to me. Are you going to help me or not?
Karlach,"Next coin, please."
Karlach,That's a sad story indeed.
Karlach,Flo is such a rotten arsehole.
Karlach,"Memorised 'em all, did you?"
Karlach,No - I'm not playing her little game.
Karlach,Yes! Now we're talking.
Karlach,"Before we head off, there's something I want you to know."
Karlach,Well. Alone it is.
Karlach,Now why would she do a thing like that?
Karlach,I'm not falling for one of her little games. No thanks.
Karlach,What'd she tell you about me?
Karlach,"That's absolutely vile. Unsurprising of Zariel, but vile all the same."
Karlach,I don't want to hear another word about her or any other devil.
Karlach,"Dammon's a smart guy, but this engine just feels... cooked."
Karlach,"Life can come at you pretty fast, soldier. A good defence can help you stay on your feet. I think you know that, even if you don't want to."
Karlach,"You still like me, right?"
Karlach,And... and nothing bad is going to happen now?
Karlach,"In that case, bring it on."
Karlach,"I adore you, you know."
Karlach,Thank the gods for that.
Karlach,"I guess we'd better get the day on. So much to do, so much to see... together! Wheyyy."
Karlach,"I LOVE YOU TOO! Oh my gods, I've been dying to say that."
Karlach,"My gods, if I smile any bigger my face is going to crack. I'm pathetic. Besotted! And it's all your fault."
Karlach,You're welcome.  Ahem.
Karlach,I do. But sometimes I don't mind being lied to.
Karlach,"But you're not the gilding type. Straightforward, true as the day is long."
Karlach,But don't worry. I'm not finished yet. Hell no - I've got a to-do list a mile long in this city. Come on. Let's go home.
Karlach,"A beautiful lie. But I guess whatever comes, we'll be there. Together. That's enough for me."
Karlach,Haha. Wait. Are you serious?
Karlach,"My gods, I think my heart almost stopped completely. Don't scare me like that, you scallywag!"
Karlach,Nothing bad is going to happen now. Not now that we're finally so... so close. Right?
Karlach,"All right. Well fuck you too then. Using me like I'm a fucking grenade in your pack. Well, you did your damage. Are you happy?"
Karlach,Get out of my face. Wanker.
Karlach,"Dada-dadum, mmm..."
Karlach,"Hey, soldier. We've got a long way ahead of us - and there's something I want to tell you."
Karlach,Don't worry. It's nothing bad. Well. Depending.
Karlach,"Hey, soldier. I'm getting a little nervous. We're getting further and further from those pricks who were hunting me."
Karlach,I'm not willing to let servants of Zariel roam the Sword Coast unchecked. Or to regroup and come after me again. Let's go get 'em. Together.
Karlach,"You can do this, Gale. And I'll be right here when you're done."
Karlach,I much more than like you too.
Karlach,Whatever it is will be laden with strings attached. No thanks.
Karlach,"Ugh. Go on, then. What is it?"
Karlach,Flo?! What was she doing here?
Karlach,"Greetings, motherfucker. Ready to die?"
Karlach,"'Her Ladyship'. Zariel really has you under her thumb, doesn't she? Pathetic."
Karlach,Avernus was never my home. It was my prison. I'm free now. AND I'M NEVER GOING BACK.
Karlach,Whoa now. I think you're confusing me with someone else.
Karlach,"Tyr - god of justice, isn't that right? If you really serve him, you'll know I never served Zariel willingly."
Karlach,Enough of the theatrics. Who are you really?
Karlach,You should've skipped the 'paladins of Tyr' gimmick and faced me for what you are.
Karlach,Fine. I'll go quietly. Me and Zariel can settle this face-to-face.
Karlach,I'd rather die than look at her fucking face ever again.
Karlach,"Tell me who you really are, and maybe we can find another way to settle this."
Karlach,Everything I did in Avernus was against my will. I never wanted to serve Zariel - not for a second.
Karlach,"Hear, hear. And hey, kicking his arse might burn off a bit of this extra heat."
Karlach,'Slave' more than 'soldier'. Whatever I've done was against my will.
Karlach,"What do you want, then? A fight? Cause I'll give you one."
Karlach,"I don't have time for this. I didn't come here for a fight, but if you want one, I'm game."
Karlach,I'm no devil. What's this all about?
Karlach,I'm going to start behaving like a devil if you keep calling me one.
Karlach,"Cut the crap, Anders. I know what you are."
Karlach,Oh this is rich.
Karlach,"Believe me, these sneaky fucks won't stop 'til they have me hogtied at her feet."
Karlach,You can't possibly believe this shit.
Karlach,Go on if you want. But I can't.
Karlach,"Pretty please, try. I'm in the mood for destruction."
Karlach,"These aren't people. Not really. I don't want to fight you, but I'm not letting them go."
Karlach,You've got to reconsider. I don't want to hurt you.
Karlach,Let's go home. It's about damn time.
Karlach,"Hah. She'd turn us both into sheep, then serve mutton for dinner. Let's stay here, where it's nice. For as long as we can."
Karlach,I'm so excited to go home. Anything that comes after that is extra.
Karlach,"I'm positive there's a catch here, but... go on. Let's see the coins."
Karlach,Here it comes...
Karlach,Incredible. Flo must be livid I got out of Avernus. Wants to drag me back to the Hells with a few horror stories. All right. Go ahead.
Karlach,Now there's a name I'd hoped never to hear again. What was Flo doing here?
Karlach,Florenta the Garrotter. A cambion I knew back in Avernus.
Karlach,"She was the closest thing I had to a friend. That said, she would've choked the life out of me if I ever turned my back on her."
Karlach,That fact that she knows where I am - where I might be going - doesn't exactly delight me.
Karlach,Maybe. Probably. I don't know. She's a half-devil. Impossible to read.
Karlach,"Let's hope it doesn't come to that. What did she want, anyway?"
Karlach,"Soul coins, huh? Those could come in handy."
Karlach,"Oh, gods damn it!"
Karlach,There you have it. Flo came all this way just to try to make me feel like shit. Clever use of her time.
Karlach,"Memorised a bunch of sad stories on her behalf, did you?"
Karlach,"Thanks, I guess."
Karlach,He should've known. Better to die a thousand deaths than let Zariel into your life.
Karlach,That's all?
Karlach,"Well thanks, Flo. Hearing a bunch of desperate horror has ruined my day, which I suppose was the point."
Karlach,I'll explain later - away from prying ears. But trust me - you'll be into it.
Karlach,"Infernal currency - each one is inscribed with a soul. Usually an evil soul, but... not always."
Karlach,Pfft. All right. Suit yourself. Have a trade or whatever. Then let's get out of here.
Karlach,"Soul coins, huh? I know this is odd, but I could make good use of those. Might as well take 'em, while they're on offer."
Karlach,Nothing would surprise me. Maybe she wants to live up to her name and wrap a cord around my neck. Or maybe she just wants to say hello.
Karlach,"I wouldn't have given her the time of day, but even I needed a laugh once in a while. And what can I say, the bitch had good jokes."
Karlach,Suit yourself.
Karlach,"I'm not past looking for Dammon, but I want us both to be ready if... well. If he can't fix me."
Karlach,Exactly. Anything you'd like to know about your enigmatic new paramour?
Karlach,"Oh boy, an arsehole! I've already won the Blade of Frontiers over; hope you'll prove more of a challenge."
Karlach,"Fair enough. Let me try again, with a little fun thrown in. How'd you like to help me kill some evil bastards?"
Karlach,"Zariel liked it so little, she sent a bunch of goons, so-called 'Paladins of Tyr', to take me back. Problem is, I'm not going."
Karlach,"Yeah yeah, don't rub it in."
Karlach,"Upper City, huh? Swish. Never spent much time there myself."
Karlach,Sounds good. I've always been curious what a patriar loo looks like.
Karlach,"Not one for roughing it, I see."
Karlach,"I tried to save you - when Bhaal came for you before, I stood by you."
Karlach,"And I stand beside you now. I know you. You're more than this. More than Bhaal. You're my friend, and I won't leave you."
Karlach,But... but this? I can't pardon this. I can't fix this. This is it. It's over.
Karlach,"Pigs, children, and people with a little bit of grit."
Karlach,Feeling at home?
Karlach,True. I've never heard a mummy complain about a wrinkled doublet. Or sour wine.
Karlach,Want me to carry you?
Karlach,Wonder if our paths ever crossed in the before-times. Were you always so sneaky?
Karlach,Sure! If you promise to swap once I get tired.
Karlach,I'd trade you if I could.
Karlach,"Seems that way! But I'm a bit out of practice, to be honest."
Karlach,"No. Particularly not for sinners like us. But if push comes to shove, I'll meet you in the City of Judgement. We'll paint it red."
Karlach,Seemed like the right thing to do. I've never really tried 'normal' before.
Karlach,"I know what you mean. Changing is hard. Every time I think I've figured it out, boom, there I am again, behaving like some version of me that never learned a damn thing."
Karlach,Impossible. You leave your stamp everywhere you go. Just look at me - absolutely besotted.
Karlach,It was nice. It was really nice.
Karlach,That could never happen. You're the best person I've ever met. Soul and body.
Karlach,You did it. You're free. I'm so godsdamn proud of you!
Karlach,"You might be your own greatest fear, but you're your own greatest strength, too. I see that every time I look at you."
Karlach,Oh - hey! Here comes our food. 
Karlach,"Hey. What's on your mind, Astarion? You seemed a million miles away just then."
Karlach,"Happy birthday, soldier."
Karlach,I've tried to tell you - I'm not what you think I am.
Karlach,How about we all take a nice deep breath and calm the fuck down. Just cause I want to live doesn't mean I want him dead.
Karlach,Your turn!
Karlach,This is it. I can practically taste his blood from here.
Karlach,My respects?! You're lucky I've agreed not to shove my boot up your - 
Karlach,I'm sure. You've probably killed scarier things blind and bleeding.
Karlach,Then fall back. I'm not letting him slip through my fingers again.
Karlach,GORTASH!
Karlach,Couldn't have said it better myself.
Karlach,"So we bide our time. But make no mistake, that monkey is mine."
Karlach,He's not slipping through my fingers this time.
Karlach,"Then stay light on your feet, soldier. They can't kill what they can't catch."
Karlach,"You're asking a lot. But I can wait - for a while, at least. Let's get Baldur's Gate safe, then rip his throat out."
Karlach,You know monsters better than anyone. Can't you look in my eyes and see I'm not a devil?
Karlach,We can take whatever we need off his corpse.
Karlach,Now you're speaking my language.
Karlach,You saw the truth. I'm not a danger to the Coast.
Karlach,"For shit's sake, you really don't know how Zariel 'recruits' her soldiers, do you?"
Karlach,"I'm not going to hurt anyone, and I'm certainly no devil."
Karlach,It's about time. Shall I put the kettle on?
Karlach,"Give it up already, I'm not the monster you think I am."
Karlach,"Ah, the legend lives. I figured you'd show up eventually."
Karlach,I figured you'd show up. The Blade of Frontiers is a man of his word.
Karlach,"Oh, goodie. Now we can go see Gortash, dangle this stone in front of him, and watch him beg before we slit his throat... right?"
Karlach,"Well, Wyll. I tried."
Karlach,Would you listen to sense? This doesn't have to end badly - for either of us.
Karlach,"Don't fucking touch me. GORTASH! FACE ME, YOU FUCKING ARSEHOLE!"
Karlach,Don't you fucking dare.
Karlach,If by 'met' you mean hoofing it through the Hells with this fucker on my tail.
Karlach,"Gods, I hate the Hells."
Karlach,That's... pretty nice. Never thought about it like that. But now I will.
Karlach,I sure am. If there's hope for me there's hope for anyone.
Karlach,Where's the axes?
Karlach,"Whatever do you mean? We're just two normal people living normal lives very, very normally."
Karlach,"I know I can't stay forever. Here. With you. In fact, I feel like... like I don't have long left at all."
Karlach,"We've been through so much, and the worst is yet to come. I have every reason to feel terrified... hopeless... like giving up."
Karlach,"But to be here, with you, in the city I love, in this world that I love so much... It's all I could really ask for."
Karlach,Come on. There's something I want to show you upstairs.
Karlach,Sounds like more your thing than mine.
Karlach,Beautifully intimidating. This place was meant to scare people into submission.
Karlach,And here I thought I rubbed you the wrong way.
Karlach,"Oops, sorry. But... now that I think of it... is mage hand especially hard to learn?"
Karlach,"Aw. Thanks, pal. I think."
Karlach,Ooh! Fun.
Karlach,"Stay strong, bear man. We're still here."
Karlach,The pursuit of intellect. Fun.
Karlach,Sounds like a place I used to know...
Karlach,"Really? Are strong women your type, Halsin?"
Karlach,Truly a bear man of the people.
Karlach,The who now?
Karlach,Baldur's Gate - we can't get there soon enough.
Karlach,"Win or lose, we're nearly there, right?"
Karlach,"The feeling's highly mutual, bear man."
Karlach,"Me too. Even with so much at stake... in this little heart of mine, I've never been happier."
Karlach,True enough. Hard to hide pretty under a bushel.
Karlach,Ugh. Are you going to try and teach me about exceptional uses for a mage hand or what?
Karlach,Joy.
Karlach,"You'll still be able to do your wizard thing, though, right?"
Karlach,Raphael's driven her mad. Poor soul.
Karlach,"Hey, uh, Henk, I think we ordered the -"
Karlach,We won't! We'll get you out. I promise.
Karlach,Well - not counting the fuckers that need a good hurting.
Karlach,"Hey, uh, Honk, I think we ordered the -"
Karlach,Gross.
Karlach,"Worst guy I ever met. Anyway, how about a toast? Oh - shit!"
Karlach,"Why don't you run off and tell him, Korilla? You love tattling to daddy, don't you?"
Karlach,"Well, here goes nothing."
Karlach,May we live every day like it's our last.
Karlach,Oh gods. What the fuck have I stumbled into.
Karlach,I really don't understand you sometimes.
Karlach,'Cause you never know when your last will come.
Karlach,Careful now. Last thing we want to do is call forth Raphael's ugly mug before we need to.<br>
Karlach,"You did us a favour, Yurgir, so I'm going to let that slide."
Karlach,That was great. The food and the company.
Karlach,You know what I want to do.
Karlach,Sounds like a challenge.
Karlach,"Squiddies have gone to war, is my guess."
Karlach,"Nor I. Never had more than a few coppers in the city, and any soul coins in Avernus went straight to Zariel."
Karlach,"I was just thinking the same thing, but less poetically."
Karlach,A girl could get used to this.
Karlach,Hope keeps you going.
Karlach,"Pretty beautiful, isn't it?"
Karlach,"From this distance between Elturel and Baldur's Gate, I'd say... a long way away."
Karlach,That means going after the things I love. Including you.
Karlach,Last night was incredible. This morning is incredible. Every moment with you is... beyond belief.
Karlach,"Good question. And easy enough, in my case. I'm afraid of dying with regrets. Of living small and giving up the ghost before I've done what I came here to do."
Karlach,"Be practical. You're infected, same as me. You need allies, not enemies."
Karlach,That's it? That's all you have to say to me?
Karlach,"Thanks to you, I don't hope for things anymore. I just take whatever it is I want."
Karlach,You better follow through on your end of the deal.
Karlach,Don't patronise me. Not after everything you've done.
Karlach,"I'll be back, motherfucker. See you soon."
Karlach,You ought to be worried about your own hide.
Karlach,"God, it's good to watch you suffer."
Karlach,"I trusted you once. I was so naive, and you took advantage of that."
Karlach,You live in a fantasy world. One where everyone is to blame but yourself.
Karlach,"I was young. You should have been my mentor, not my betrayer."
Karlach,The only thing that's about to fall at my feet is you.
Karlach,Turns out I don't want to play your little game. I've had enough of those to last a lifetime.
Karlach,"Thanks to you, I endured more suffering than you could begin to fathom."
Karlach,I did what I had to. I have no regrets.
Karlach,An alliance? You must be joking.
Karlach,Bane wills us to work together.
Karlach,"How can I trust you now, Gortash? After everything you did to me?"
Karlach,Take the Netherstones. I deserve the power you promised - even if I have to share it with the likes of you.
Karlach,Take the Netherstone. I deserve the power you promised - even if I have to share it with the likes of you.
Karlach,"I don't have them on me. Give me a little time to retrieve them, and they're yours."
Karlach,"I'm not giving you anything. If we'll both rule, we can each keep our stones."
Karlach,Fine. Take them.
Karlach,Fine. Take it.
Karlach,Dream on.
Karlach,"It's over for you, Gortash. Take one last look at me, cause I'm the last thing you'll ever see."
Karlach,"In your case, it's practically a vital organ. Though the veil seems to lift that little bit every day, and I just see... you."
Karlach,Give me time. Our lord wills it.
Karlach,"However little I think of you, you always manage to find a way to make me hate you even more."
Karlach,"Damn. After a decade in hell, I was hoping for a little company. Especially some who looked like you."
Karlach,"You know, I could've used a friend. Pity that won't be you."
Karlach,"Shit. I just can't shake you, can I?"
Karlach,"Like a hammer knows an untouchable nail. Look, I'm not -"
Karlach,"Aw, come on."
Karlach,Heyy!
Karlach,"Well, soldier? What's the word?"
Karlach,We're looking to get rid of these parasites for good - and ruin some bastards' days while we're at it. Sounds like your kind of venture.
Karlach,I'll do you one better: allies.
Karlach,Truce.
Karlach,"Oh, here we go."
Karlach,I'm working on it - but not for your benefit.
Karlach,"The Blade of Frontiers. Thought I'd shaken you for good after the mind flayer ship. But you just can't get enough of me, can you."
Karlach,You want a fight? Let's see what the Blade can do.
Karlach,"Yes, I served Zariel. But I had no bloody choice."
Karlach,You're a problem. And I'm thinking violence is the solution.
Karlach,"Ahh, I love this time of year. The dickheads start popping up wherever you look."
Karlach,Ding ding ding. You got there in the end.
Karlach,Get out. And don't show your face again.
Karlach,Truce. But I think it's best if you get on your way.
Karlach,"How about 'teammates'? Find a cure for these parasites, smash some skulls together."
Karlach,"Great idea. You could join up with us - find a cure for these parasites, smash some skulls."
Karlach,I don't give a shit about your agreement.
Karlach,From you? I guess nothing. Not anymore.
Karlach,You better lower that blade if you know what's good for you.
Karlach,"Gods, I'm terrible at this. Trying to have a first date, but I feel like I've known you all my life."
Karlach,"No! Yes. No - we came to have a nice date, and that's what we're going to do. Go on: date me. I dare you."
Karlach,"Right here in Baldur's Gate, more or less. My folks are long gone now, but they raised me in the Outer City. Dad was a porter in town, mum did laundry. Still think of her when I smell clean sheets."
Karlach,The man doesn't know the meaning of the word respect. He'll double cross us at the first opportunity.
Karlach,You make it sound like we were lovers. Or friends. But that wasn't it.
Karlach,You are terrifying. I love it so much.
Karlach,"I trusted you. I respected you. It was my job to protect you, and that's what I did."
Karlach,I was so young. I didn't recognise evil when I saw it.
Karlach,"When you turned on me, I was too dumbstruck to realise what was happening. No way he'd hurt me, I thought."
Karlach,Hard to imagine you as a naughty little boy. Who knew he'd grow up to be the very paragon of right-doing?
Karlach,"I understand. The people who hurt us have an annoying habit of lingering, one way or another. I'm sorry for what he did to you."
Karlach,You betrayed me for reasons I still don't quite understand. But I suppose evil has no real cause. It just is.
Karlach,Until it isn't.
Karlach,Then run while you still can.
Karlach,I can't wait.
Karlach,"You can't escape me. Wherever you go, I'll find you. Wherever you run, there I'll be."
Karlach,"Very clever, fabricating people to do your fighting for you. But they won't be able to protect you forever, Gortash."
Karlach,The second I'm out of here...
Karlach,Ugh...
Karlach,He's toast. I don't care how many big shiny boys he has.
Karlach,"You won't be much help from in here, soldier."
Karlach,Godsdammit.
Karlach,"Tsk tsk. The Dead Three out there, and us in here."
Karlach,Right you are.
Karlach,This fucking cell smells like eggs.
Karlach,It's over. He's... gone.
Karlach,Thank the gods. I thought I was going to have to take your head.
Karlach,Don't lecture me about goodness. You don't know the first thing about it.
Karlach,"There will come a time, sooner than you think, when death comes knocking on your door. You'll swing that door open, and you'll cower before what you see, and you'll beg, 'Please, Karlach. Spare me.'"
Karlach,"Aw. Well, if you ever want to learn, I'd love to take you to a little pond I know outside the city. Shallow, safe, and I'd be there to help you float."
Karlach,You have no future.
Karlach,"We were poorer than dirt, but my gods we had fun. What about you?"
Karlach,Wonder if they're still out there somewhere. No chance they could've forgotten someone like you.
Karlach,"Cut from the same cloth, some might say."
Karlach,"Hear, hear."
Karlach,"Might've, if you spent any time in the Outer City. We didn't exactly hide ourselves under a bushel."
Karlach,It's one of the things I love about you - your ability to see things through.
Karlach,"You don't have to explain, if you don't want to. But whatever time I have left, I'd like to spend getting to know you, exactly as you are."
Karlach,That explains your grit. And your strength. And so many other things I love about you.
Karlach,Show me your ways.
Karlach,Blamed it on an imp and never told a soul the truth. Beat that.
Karlach,"We'll have to make some new secrets between us, then."
Karlach,Study Gortash. What are his intentions?
Karlach,Study Gortash again. What more can you glean?
Karlach,Read Gortash's thoughts.
Karlach,Read Gortash's thoughts again.
Karlach,"Study Gortash. We can't trust this prick, can we?"
Karlach,"Dream on, Gortash. You're dead. Just like me, but sooner."
Karlach,"This thing in my chest is killing me, you know. You did that."
Karlach,"Gods, I can't wait to kill you."
Karlach,Deceived by who?
Karlach,"Thanks to you, I don't hope for things anymore. I just take whatever it is I want. See you soon, motherfucker."
Karlach,Those things were evil - just like their papa.
Karlach,"To think I ever worked for you. Proudly, too."
Karlach,I don't know. You managed it for a solid decade.
Karlach,Do we now?
Karlach,It's him. Gortash. 
Karlach,"Fun, right? Who knows what you could find."
Karlach,"Still. You looked so peaceful. I wanted to go wherever you were. But I'm me, so I did a lap of camp instead."
Karlach,Like the dead. The excruciatingly happy dead.
Karlach,"You can trust me to use the stones as we planned - to defeat the brain, and nothing more. It's the perfect solution."
Karlach,Sorry I haven't visited. I've been... away. But I'm back now.
Karlach,"If anyone was gonna look even better with tentacles, it was gonna be me. Let's do this."
Karlach,I miss you so much. But I'm happy. And getting up to some really important shit. Maybe you can see for yourselves. I don't know.
Karlach,"You're with me here, anyway. Taters."
Karlach,Taters and turnips.
Karlach,I can't even remember how that started. It's always been how we said 'I love you'.
Karlach,"A whole private language, just for us. Just me, now."
Karlach,"Mum, you used to say there was no such thing as death. Only change."
Karlach,"Dad thought that was a load of woo. That gone meant gone, unless you'd struck a deal with one of the gods. But you had better things to do than beg favours off immortals, right, dad?"
Karlach,I don't know what I think.
Karlach,Here lie Pluck and Caerlack Cliffgate. Hi mum. Hi dad.
Karlach,Nothing to do but cross that bridge when I get there.
Karlach,Mum was onto something. How can we die when we become the grass?
Karlach,"Taters and turnips, grass."
Karlach,"Dad had it right. Once it's lights out, it's lights out."
Karlach,"Wish me luck, mum and dad. I need it."
Karlach,What about the City of Judgement and the gods and all that?
Karlach,"You'd have to worship the gods to get picked up by 'em. The rest of us just fade away, or so they say."
Karlach,Let's hope they've got it wrong.
Karlach,What I wouldn't give for another hour together. Another minute.
Karlach,Mum would've lived if we'd found a good enough healer who'd take our gold. Greedy bastards.
Karlach,"As for dad... bad luck, I guess. But they should've found someone younger to take the job on the Risen Road. Maybe someone with a better back could've dodged the cart in time..."
Karlach,I never would've bothered with Gortash if they'd been around. They wouldn't have let me within a league of him.
Karlach,"Something to look forward to - an answer to the greatest mystery of all. Bit morbid, but true all the same."
Karlach,But. They were already gone.
Karlach,Let me transform. I'm... I'm not long for this world. I can feel it.
Karlach,"Sorry, soldier, but I didn't ask for your two coppers. The advice I give a tief kid from the Coast is between me and them."
Karlach,I thought they had you for keeps. Glad you got out.
Karlach,"Hey, I remember you. The weaponsmith, right? Your city was swallowed up by Avernus. And you were enlisted against your will, like my good self."
Karlach,Hey soldier - I think we picked up some of that infernal iron already. What say you - should I give it to him?
Karlach,Will you be able to turn down the temperature a little? Worried I'm gonna go in for a handshake and singe someone's arm off one of these days.
Karlach,"Even I'm not thick enough to fall for the same trick twice. But keep it up, kid, and you'll be scamming with the greats in no time."
Karlach,"Be my guest. But don't get too close, or your eyes'll melt shut."
Karlach,A little gift from Zariel. Keeps me burning hot.
Karlach,"Ha! Nice try, shorty. Keep it up, though, and you'll be scamming with the greats in no time."
Karlach,The devils were delighted when your city was swallowed up. I thought they had you for keeps. Glad you got out.
Karlach,It was the favourite pet of a nasty demon called Bulwig. He wanted to skin me alive after.
Karlach,"I spent a good bit of time in the Hells. Enlisted against my will by the archdevil Zariel. Same as you, I suppose, if you're from Elturel."
Karlach,"It is, isn't it. Hope he makes it out of this mess with his wits in one piece. I'd like to see him set up in a proper home in the city. Every kid deserves that."
Karlach,Get her away from that thing - now!
Karlach,Didn't have a choice. Life doesn't pull any punches for a tiefling kid on the Sword Coast.
Karlach,You've got wits. Style. Those will take you farther faster than brute strength - believe me.
Karlach,You just do. Go after whatever's in your way - do it with everything you've got.
Karlach,Sure - give us a look.
Karlach,"Keep it, kid. You might need it."
Karlach,"Careful, kid. Once you start, it's hard to stop."
Karlach,Lots and lots of practice.
Karlach,What can I say? I'm a natural born brawler.
Karlach,How long were you in Avernus?
Karlach,"All right, ivory tower. Tell me more about how a tiefling kid should survive the shit life throws at him. I'm all ears."
Karlach,"You know what it's like. If given half a chance, the Coast would eat a tiefling alive - never mind one that'd been to the Hells and back. If the kid's got a skill, he should use it however he can."
Karlach,I can't believe you saw that. You're too young for that.
Karlach,"Fight with those, and you may find you never need to use your fists at all."
Karlach,Here lie Pluck and Caerlack Cliffgate. My parents. Hi mum. Hi dad.
Karlach,Meant 'I love you' in the Cliffgate household. I can't even remember how it started anymore. Lost family lore.
Karlach,I'll give you all the gory details when we can talk in private.
Karlach,"Sorry, I think you have the wrong person."
Karlach,"Almost had you there. Hello, Fytz."
Karlach,Sorry - you've got the wrong person.
Karlach,I would have if I could. But it's a long story.
Karlach,Archduke Fox lording it over the hen house. What could go wrong?
Karlach,I saw red when I found out.
Karlach,"I'm sorry, Fytz, but I've got to run. I'm in town on very urgent business."
Karlach,Would you believe me if I said I've got to save the city?
Karlach,"A long, shitty story. I'd love to sit down with a pint and tell 'em all to you, Fytz."
Karlach,"Never mind for now. Bye, Fytz."
Karlach,Not like that. But I've got some very dear friends.
Karlach,Neverwinter? Who told you that?
Karlach,"Of course - this is Fytz. One of my old mates from the neighbourhood. We grew up together, moved to the Lower City together, even worked together for you-know-who."
Karlach,Right?! I'm sure the fox will make a great duke of the henhouse.
Karlach,Uh huh. Isn't he handsome?
Karlach,Uh huh. Isn't she beautiful?
Karlach,Uh huh. Aren't they adorable?
Karlach,"I can't tell you how good it is to see you, Fytz. I'd love to come have dinner with you and Gregor. "
Karlach,"We're in the city on some urgent business, but can I come find you when it's all settled?"
Karlach,Maybe once. Not anymore.
Karlach,Ew. No. Just mates. Very good mates.
Karlach,Ew. No. Just travelling together.
Karlach,"Another long, shitty story. I'd love to sit down with a pint and tell 'em all to you, Fytz. And hear every last thing you've been up to, too."
Karlach,"Well go on, girl! Tell me everything!"
Karlach,Sorry I haven't visited. I've been... away. But I'm back now! And I brought friends.
Karlach,It's just me.
Karlach,Can I be the godsmother?
Karlach,There was a lot of silly nonsense in our house. My mates used to say we had our own personal language. I guess I'm the last remaining speaker.
Karlach,Me too. Didn't realise how nice it'd feel to come say hello.
Karlach,"I was a teenager when mum passed - bad fever. A good healer could've saved her, but she slipped away before we found one who'd take our gold."
Karlach,"Dad went a few years later. He was on an errand for work, travelling the Risen Road. His cart overturned and caught him just so."
Karlach,"I was on my own after that. Fell in with Gortash not long after. If my folks had been alive, they would've sniffed him out straight away."
Karlach,But. They weren't.
Karlach,Mum used to say there was no such thing as death. That there was only change.
Karlach,"Dad thought that was a load of woo. That gone meant gone, unless you'd struck a deal with one of the gods. Said he had better things to do in life than beg favours off immortals."
Karlach,I'm not sure what I believe.
Karlach,"Something to look forward to. Bit morbid, but true all the same."
Karlach,"Nice thought, isn't it? This grass could be my mum's hair. The air in my lungs might be my dad telling me 'taters'. I like that."
Karlach,There is. I'd love to introduce you properly sometime. Maybe over a flagon of something dry?
Karlach,"Classic Pluck Cliffgate. Harsh but honest. He may be right - but then again, he may not. Only one way to find out, huh?"
Karlach,Hopefully there's more waiting for me than that. Very hopefully.
Karlach,"Hey, my folks are buried here. I'd love to pay them a visit."
Karlach,Fytz. If you aren't a sight for sore eyes.
Karlach,"He's a liar. Always has been, I now realise."
Karlach,Didn't you hear? I killed that motherfucker.
Karlach,Fytz! Congratulations! That's amazing news.
Karlach,Don't worry. I'm going to deal with him.
Karlach,The prick's a liar.
Karlach,I guess that's technically true.
Karlach,Fytz! Congratulations!
Karlach,I never took you for the parental type.
Karlach,"If they deign to choose us. There's no guarantee, is there? And I've made little effort to attract the loyalty of anyone but you."
Karlach,"From the look of things, you've got your wits about you. A clever mind and a bit of style will take you a long way. "
Karlach,I think I picked up some of that infernal iron already. Can we at least see what you can do?
Karlach,I'll take whatever it is you're offering.
Karlach,"Off the anvil, into the forge. We'll find them - hopefully."
Karlach,Let's move!
Karlach,"Fine. Well, go on then."
Karlach,"But - but still, you can give me something that'll let me touch again, right? Safely?"
Karlach,I never wanted to live forever. I just want to live good.
Karlach,Nothing is more important than this. Not to me.
Karlach,Prick.
Karlach,"Ew, no! Good news, please, my good man."
Karlach,"The good news, obviously!"
Karlach,"Would be a lot better if you'd find a way to fix this engine, Dammon."
Karlach,"Never mind. I'm glad you're set up for the long run, in any case. One of us should be."
Karlach,Gotta run!
Karlach,"Thanks to you, I'm feeling well. "
Karlach,You read my mind.
Karlach,"Yeah. Apart from the doom and gloom, you've given me more than I could ever hope to repay."
Karlach,"The minute I set foot back in Avernus, Zariel will force me back into service. I'm not doing her bidding again. I'd rather die."
Karlach,"I can't believe it. Thank you, Dammon. Thank you so much."
Karlach,Ignot. Look at that. No fire.
Karlach,Can we go to bed now?
Karlach,You're all right. No burns.
Karlach,There. So did it... work?
Karlach,I'm still burning just as hot as ever.
Karlach,Wouldn't leave you folks behind - not ever.
Karlach,Never mind. Glad you're all right in any case. Nice forge you've got here.
Karlach,Glad to see you're so well set-up here.
Karlach,Let me see your wares.
Karlach,- touch people?!
Karlach,Good news is my favourite kind.
Karlach,Right? All this doom and gloom. I have something far more exciting on my mind than this bloody tin box.
Karlach,"Thanks, Dammon. Really. You've given me more than I could ever repay."
Karlach,"Thank you, Dammon. I can't tell you what this means to me."
Karlach,Isn't there anything you can do?
Karlach,How long do I have?
Karlach,I don't know what to say.
Karlach,Say nothing. You're still trying to process what you've heard.
Karlach,You're going to let a bit of iron beat you?!
Karlach,Pause. Is he flirting with you?
Karlach,Take your leave - you have someone you really want to touch.
Karlach,"Still haven't lost it, after all these years. Thanks, Dammon."
Karlach,Dammon! Thank the gods. I've been looking for you everywhere.
Karlach,Nothing is inevitable. Especially not this.
Karlach,Well done making it out alive.
Karlach,"Who needs a heart when you've got one of these to keep you warm. Thank you, Zariel."
Karlach,"Infernal iron, eh? I can swing that. Will come back with command in tow and take it from there. Thanks, Dammon - you don't know what this means."
Karlach,Give us the good news.
Karlach,That's all I needed to hear. I'll be back with some infernal iron.
Karlach,"Ah, it'll keep. I have infernal iron to find."
Karlach,You think wrong! Thanks Dammon; I'll be back.
Karlach,Head off before he can say another word.
Karlach,I've got the iron right here. Let's make this happen.
Karlach,Any idea where I should look for the last piece?
Karlach,That's amazing! How did you figure it out?
Karlach,"Same thing as you, I reckon. Trying to stay out of the shadows."
Karlach,Thanks - I'll try to find some right away.
Karlach,I changed my mind. Perhaps you'd like to check out my infernal engine after all?
Karlach,I found the infernal iron you mentioned.
Karlach,"Yeah, I'm so lucky."
Karlach,Why should I report to the Steel Watch factory?
Karlach,"Erm, I think you have the wrong hunk of metal."
Karlach,Not sure. Maybe whatever keeps them going is similar to my tin can. 
Karlach,"If it turns out I'm the fucking prototype for these things, I'll dismantle every single one of them."
Karlach,Yeah. Anything spicy you can tell me about the ol' prick?
Karlach,"Let's make tracks before this thing gives me the lash of Bane. See you around, soldier."
Karlach,"Yeah. Hey, metal man - if I report to this foundry, can my engine be fixed?"
Karlach,"Yeah yeah, tell me something I don't know."
Karlach,I don't like this. What are you planning?
Karlach,"Well! I, uh - yeah. I guess I was. I mean, you should avoid fighting for devils if you can. But if you can't, it helps to have a good right hook."
Karlach,Gortash isn't a genius. He's just a clever arsehole.
Karlach,I don't think so.
Karlach,Can I see your wares?
Karlach,Thanks a lot. I'll be back when I find that infernal iron.
Karlach,"A lovely chap. Didn't kick arse in the Blood War, but that's neither here nor there."
Karlach,"No, he only sold his soul to one."
Karlach,"Sorry, kid. Look, forget about us begrudgers and bruisers."
Karlach,Had to. Life didn't pull any punches. It was up to me to learn to take a hit - and deal one back.
Karlach,Where should I look for infernal iron?
Karlach,I have some infernal iron right here. Take it.
Karlach,"Elturel - your city was swallowed up by Avernus, right?"
Karlach,I only recently escaped the Hells. I was enlisted against my will by the archdevil Zariel.
Karlach,"Thanks, mate. You'll be seeing me again soon."
Karlach,Do you know what you're doing?
Karlach,"Believe it or not, I'm not a Steel Watcher."
Karlach,I'm here on business with Lord Gortash.
Karlach,"Sure thing, chromium. I will report to the Steel Watch Foundry."
Karlach,We certainly will.
Karlach,Good. Someone should be.
Karlach,"Hey soldier - we've got some infernal iron already. Let's give it to him, hey?"
Karlach,I'm sure!
Karlach,"Yes we do. We absolutely do. I need help, and I'm going to get it. Got it?"
Karlach,"Fuck yes, we will."
Karlach,Gimme the good news.
Karlach,"We have business in the city. Same as you, by the looks of things. Nice forge you have here."
Karlach,"That's terrible. If we can help them, we will."
Karlach,I'll come back when I've got the iron and my team in tow. They'll definitely want to see what happens!
Karlach,"I have business in this cursed wasteland, if you can believe it."
Karlach,"In fact, I've got a piece on me now. Let's do this."
Karlach,Thanks - I'll definitely be back.
Karlach,Any idea where I can score some infernal iron?
Karlach,Could I see your wares?
Karlach,Looking for help with this hot tin tub I call my heart.
Karlach,"Hey! Dammon might be knocking around here, right?"
Karlach,"Hey, that weaponsmith you mentioned might be here, right?"
Karlach,Infernal metal! This can help Dammon patch up my engine.
Karlach,Yes! Dammon can use this to fix me!
Karlach,Infernal metal! That's what my engine's made of. Hang on to that!
Karlach,"Hey, it's Dammon! Let's say hi."
Karlach,"If I report to this foundry, can my engine be fixed?"
Karlach,What if I told you I'm not a Steel Watcher?
Karlach,I guess that kind of makes us cousins.
Karlach,"I'll do that. See you around, Fytz."
Karlach,My gods! Is that Fytz?!
Karlach,"What are you doing?! All those people, Astarion - stop!"
Karlach,"It's done. Just like that. Gods, help us."
Karlach,"I'd ask you what you'd been up to for six whole months, but then I'd have to reciprocate. And I'm not sure you're ready for the truth."
Karlach,Let us test that theory.
Karlach,"I'm not a murderer, if that's what you mean. But a girl's got to eat."
Karlach,"As you like, soldier. It's very good to see you looking so well, regardless."
Karlach,I can't tell if that's admiration or revulsion on your face. Or maybe something else entirely.
Karlach,"Maybe I thought our paths would cross on their own. Or maybe I wasn't sure what you'd make of me. I've changed so much. But then again, you have too."
Karlach,"Honestly? Never better. My life is so rich now - so... multifaceted. I've wanted to share it with you, but maybe I was scared. I've changed so much. But then again, so have you."
Karlach,"It's good to be among friends again, isn't it?"
Karlach,And if any of mummy's little friends want to pick up where the others left off... they'll find nothing but a pile of ash.
Karlach,"That's right, she won't. She can't. She couldn't even lay a finger. AHAHAHAHA!"
Karlach,"Zariel's gotta stop fucking with me, you know? I'm done with it. I'm done with her. I'm free. I'm FREE! AHAHAHAHA!"
Karlach,"Don't I know it. It went so fast, didn't it? One moment we were on the nautiloid, the next we were... here."
Karlach,An astral projection. Very clever. I'll stay on my toes around this one.
Karlach,"Yeah. Get in, grab shit, and go. Easy."
Karlach,Huh. I feel... cool. Like my engine isn't going to explode. Guess returning to the Hells really is all it takes.
Karlach,I better do what I came here to do and scarper before I get used to feeling like I might live.
Karlach,AGHHH! Whose idea was this? Was it mine? Am I insane?
Karlach,"The short version: Clever sadism. The longer version: I worked for a guy who sold me into Zariel's service. She put the engine in my chest, and now it's burning me up."
Karlach,Thing's been running in overdrive since I left Avernus; I'll burn clean through anyone who gets too close.
Karlach,"I need to find a mechanic. A good one, or this thing's going boom."
Karlach,"Tell that to the inferno where my heart was, soldier. Actually, don't. I don't want to piss it off."
Karlach,"You leave your left flank wide open. If I'm ever not around to cover it, you may find yourself on the wrong side of a goblin spear one of these days."
Karlach,"I'm sure we will. But... in case we don't, a bit of advice."
Karlach,I'm sure you'd manage. But this ol' girl's got a few things to do before it comes to that.
Karlach,"Gods, I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm going to get out of here - right?"
Karlach,"Well... I imagine it's lights out, Big K. And then it'll just be you, your parasite, and the wild yonder."
Karlach,Maybe at first. But the person I used to be had a deep empathy that hasn't left me. Let me explain.
Karlach,"It's strange, I know. I couldn't have imagined this life for myself in a million years. But... I think I'm doing good in the world - and staying fed along the way. What more could a Karlach want?"
Karlach,"Perhaps not. You were always my hero - and still, the very sight of you inspires courage I sometimes lose sight of in this... cerebral new form."
Karlach,"Ah, Wyll. To see you returned to the root of yourself, with your fate in your own hands... you're yourself, but more than ever."
Karlach,"You called me a devil once. I called you a fool. We were both so wrong. And together... together, we saved the world."
Karlach,"You are who you were meant to be. Your own man. And, as ever, as always - my hero."
Karlach,I remember when Vlaakith's favour was the lodestar of your life. But you weren't afraid to give her up as the facts demanded.
Karlach,I am. And would you believe that I'm happy?
Karlach,"I can think of no better man for the job of moulding minds. I'd love to see you in action, but I fear your students might find me fairly distressing."
Karlach,"I never thought I'd see the day. But then again, our victory against the Dead Three changed everything."
Karlach,"I can relate, in my own way."
Karlach,"I can feel it. You've evolved, same as myself."
Karlach,Impressive. You've been looking after yourself well - far different from the haunted person I once knew.
Karlach,"I thought I was good at cracking skulls before. Now, I've got it down to something of a science - or maybe more of a religion."
Karlach,"Your mind, once broken, has shown surprising resiliency."
Karlach,True. But I've found ways to maintain my values while respecting that which I am - that which made it possible for me to live.
Karlach,"I've made arrangements with a healer in the city. When a patient is beyond saving, but still able to speak for themselves, they're offered a choice."
Karlach,"They can go as nature intends to take them. Or, when they're ready - when their goodbyes have been said, their affairs settled, and all that awaits them is pain - I relieve them."
Karlach,"When I consume their brains, I am nourished by much more than the physical nutrition. Their memories - from birth to death - become part of me."
Karlach,"I've lived hundreds of childhoods, first loves, marriages, feuds and friendships. I remember them all. And in this way, we all live on. Together."
Karlach,"I think of you, too. This life of ours, soldier - it's a long one, if we're lucky. Who knows what the future holds for either of us."
Karlach,"Thanks, soldier. It feels that way, too."
Karlach,It's been wonderful to see you again. Reminds me of old times around the campfire. We used to think becoming a mind flayer was a fate worse than death.
Karlach,"I wouldn't trade my life - this life - for anything. Funny how things change, isn't it?"
Karlach,"Thanks, soldier. It's good to see you looking so well. And now that we've connected again, don't be a stranger."
Karlach,"Enjoy the night, my friend. I know I will."
Karlach,"Stubbornly yourself, aren't you. I suppose I used to be, too. But this evolution has shown me parts of myself I never knew existed."
Karlach,We need to catch up with that mechanic. And pray he's extremely good.
Karlach,"Listen, in case something happens to me... I've been wanting to tell you something."
Karlach,Never. I mean - not if I can help it.
Karlach,"An infernal mechanic could do it - and quickly. I'm hanging on, but just by my fingertips."
Karlach,"If he went on to Baldur's Gate, we might be able to find him. He owes you a favour after what you did, right?"
Karlach,Here's hoping.
Karlach,I'm not going out yet - got business with a motherfucker first.
Karlach,I want to live to fight it. Not burn out before I get the chance.
Karlach,I've got a long list of evil fucks to deal with. And I'm not going out until I do.
Karlach,"Then I need to find an infernal mechanic - and quickly. I'm hanging on, but just by my fingertips."
Karlach,"I'm more likely to implode than blow up, more's the pity. Wouldn't mind taking out a few cultists on my way out the door. But better if it doesn't come to that."
Karlach,"I need to find an infernal mechanic - quickly. I'm hanging on, but just by my fingertips."
Karlach,"I won't know peace 'til I've dug my thumbs into his eyes. 'Til I've ripped his throat out with my teeth. Hear that, Gortash?! I'm coming for you!"
Karlach,"Whatever the fuck he's been up to in the last ten years, we have to stop him. He can't just keep ruining people's lives. He can't get away with it!"
Karlach,I need to get myself fixed in time to make him pay.
Karlach,"Hey, soldier. I thought I might come visit you later. When everyone's asleep."
Karlach,"Haha! Please. We've waited long enough, I think."
Karlach,See you later. I can't wait.
Karlach,That's perfectly fine. I just want to be with you. No expectations. No pressure. Just us.
Karlach,You mean you - you aren't interested anymore. In me.
Karlach,"I'll - I mean - I need to do some thinking. Thanks for telling me, I guess. I - sleep well, I guess."
Karlach,You don't have to love me. You don't even have to like me. But you do have to treat me with respect.
Karlach,"Do some thinking on how you treat people, soldier. This isn't the way."
Karlach,"But I do. And I want you. Or I thought I did, anyway."
Karlach,I want to be with someone who's sure about me. Someone who wants me as much as I want them. It seems like that isn't you.
Karlach,Mmm... la da da... bum ba du-dumdum...
Karlach,"Oh! Gods, sorry, I was in my own world. Hi. Hello, good morning."
Karlach,Me too. See you later. I can't wait.
Karlach,"Zariel may have put the fucking thing in, but Gortash gave her the go-ahead. You expect this shit from devils. But not from the people you care about."
Karlach,"Do you know what's inside me? An infernal engine. It burns as hot as the Hells, and it's been running in overdrive since I left Avernus."
Karlach,"Do you know this engine inside of me is going to blow? If I don't find an infernal mechanic, I'm finished."
Karlach,"Without a mechanic, you might need to get used to a slowly overheating tiefling at your flank."
Karlach,My engine... it's getting worse. Feels like it's going to burst out of my chest.
Karlach,Wyll!
Karlach,"Ngh - hey soldier, I... well, I'm not feeling so good."
Karlach,Wait... what? No. This can't be. Bring him back. Bring him back NOW!
Karlach,"You're a disgusting little shit, you know that, Mizora?"
Karlach,Let's get out of here.
Karlach,"Argh! Not now, Karlach. Not now. Please."
Karlach,This thing in my chest is his doing. The past decade of Hell - all cause of him.
Karlach,He looks just the same. Same as he did ten years ago. That smirk.
Karlach,Gods! He was right here! He was so close!
Karlach,This thing in my chest is his doing. All those years in Hell. And he looks the same now as he did then. Same smirk.
Karlach,And I'll be the one to do the honours. He's got so much to answer for.
Karlach,The fucker has to die.
Karlach,I just want to understand. I just want to know why.
Karlach,Keep cool. I'm going to find him. I'm going to stop him.
Karlach,Called himself 'the Lash of Bane'. The fucker who sold me to Zariel is working for the god of tyranny.
Karlach,Ketheric is dead. 
Karlach,"Hey, soldier - you said you might try cooling me down. Any leads?"
Karlach,Yes!
Karlach,"There's got to be something, right? Something cold - or water! Or maybe if you were less... burnable. There's a thought, right?"
Karlach,"I can feel it. The engine. It's getting hotter. Louder. It's going to blow, if we don't find another way to fix it."
Karlach,"I can feel it. The engine. It's getting hotter. Louder. I feel like... like it might burn out completely. And soon, if I don't find some way to fix it."
Karlach,"You know, Zariel may have put the fucking thing in, but Gortash gave her the go-ahead. You expect this shit from devils. But not from the people you care about."
Karlach,Let's get to the city. Got business there I'm highly fucking keen to attend to.
Karlach,But with a far more impressive wardrobe.
Karlach,I loved it too. More than I've ever loved anything.
Karlach,Our victory against the Dead Three changed everything.
Karlach,You deserve it more than anyone. You saved Baldur's Gate - all of Faerûn!
Karlach,He said there's a potential in his infirmary. A very old woman recently diagnosed with a wasting sickness. She seemed interested in what I have to offer.
Karlach,"I'll want to have a good long talk with her before we make an arrangement. Though if I'm being very selfish, I hope she'll say yes. I'm absolutely famished - and think of all those memories."
Karlach,"I don't hide it well, do I? Some things don't change, even when everything else does."
Karlach,"It's funny. I'm hungry in my body, but in my soul too. That woman has lived a long life - births, deaths, love, misfortune. And if she agrees, I'll be able to give her a dignified end, and remember it all in her honour."
Karlach,"But hey, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's enjoy ourselves! This is a rare enough treat, isn't it?"
Karlach,"I'm sure of very little these days. But at least this way, I can live. And those who offer themselves to me can live on too."
Karlach,"Births, first loves, marriages, losses - I remember them all and always will. Each memory I've consumed is of value."
Karlach,"I'd ask what you have in mind, but I'm not sure I want to know."
Karlach,But let's focus on the task at hand. We've been brought here to enjoy ourselves and see some old faces. Let's not be rude.
Karlach,Gods. Sometimes I really question what we've both become.
Karlach,Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Karlach,"I can't wait to say hello, but to be honest, I'm keen to visit the doctor before it gets too late."
Karlach,"I thought so too. The doctor will keep a light on, I'm sure. I just hope your parents won't wait up for us."
Karlach,"Always, darling."
Karlach,Bold. There'll be plenty of time for that after we're caught up with our old friends.
Karlach,"And another will go by before we realise it. Make the most of Withers' little reunion. For all we know, it could be our last."
Karlach,"Anyway, I'll need to visit the doctor on our way home."
Karlach,Look at this place. At us. This is the best party I've ever been to.
Karlach,"Oh shit. Oh my gods! He wasn't kidding. Withers, you mad bastard, you brought me back!"
Karlach,Soldier. It's really you.
Karlach,"I've missed you. Like, I've really missed you. And you're so... shimmery."
Karlach,"I've missed you so much, Wyll. The Grand Duke."
Karlach,"I've missed you so much, Wyll. The Blade of Frontiers."
Karlach,"I've missed you so much, Wyll. The Blade of Avernus."
Karlach,"I thought so too. The doctor will keep a light on, I'm sure. "
Karlach,"I've missed you, Gale. Or should I say... your holiness?"
Karlach,"Fascinating, isn't it? Everyone has changed so much. Yet the heart of it all feels so familiar."
Karlach,"It's good to see you again, soldier. I hope it won't be the last time."
Karlach,"Seven thousand Astarions, unleashed on the Sword Coast. It'll be a well-dressed flood of mayhem, at least."
Karlach,"You did it. You really did it. There's no coming back from this, Astarion. Was it worth it?"
Karlach,"Come on, Astarion. Let's get out of here. You've done all you can."
Karlach,"Oh shit. Oh my gods! He wasn't kidding. Withers, you mad bastard, you brought us back!"
Karlach,Commander Zhula won't know where the fuck we went. Ha! 
Karlach,"Man, I can't wait to say hi to everyone. Look at 'em, the beauts."
Karlach,"Rest up, soldier. My tin can'll be all right for the night. And you and me will get to sleep with both eyes shut for the first time in... six months?"
Karlach,"Then again, maybe we won't sleep at all. "
Karlach,"Me too, my love. See you soon."
Karlach,C'mere you goon.
Karlach,"Hear, hear. Enjoy it, soldier. You've earned it."
Karlach,"Are you enjoying yourself, my love?"
Karlach,"She's got a night in her, I think. Any trouble and I'll toddle back off to hell, quick as you please."
Karlach,Zariel's probably got a load of cambions guarding that forge. I'm sure she knows I'll want in. She'll do anything to stop me from fixing this thing.
Karlach,"I might have an in with one of the guards though. You may remember my old friend Flo. Not sure she'll help us, but... maybe."
Karlach,"I might have an in with one of the guards though. An old acquaintance called Flo. Not sure she'll help us, but... maybe."
Karlach,We might get to come home - permanently. Maybe even sooner than we think.
Karlach,It sounds like you've been keeping busy.
Karlach,Sounds like you've been keeping busy.
Karlach,It sounds like you've been keeping busy. I'm glad you have someone at your side all the way.
Karlach,Sounds like you've been keeping busy. Glad you have someone at your side all the way.
Karlach,"That can't have been easy. I'm glad you've stayed upright, anyway."
Karlach,"That can't have been easy. Glad you've stayed upright, anyway."
Karlach,That can't have been easy. Glad you've got backup.
Karlach,Oh hey! Before you go. I've been thinking about those blueprints we found.
Karlach,"I've missed you, Gale. Gods, you look so... so fresh!"
Karlach,"I've missed you, you old Bhaalspawn. Oh - do you not want me to call you the B-word any more?"
Karlach,"It's been tough, keeping myself alive."
Karlach,"I'd offer to look you up once I'm out, but something tells me you'll be hard to reach."
Karlach,"I guess this is 'goodbye,' Gale Dekarios. Until we meet again, if we do."
Karlach,"Trying not to count my owlbears before they've hatched, but the thought of coming back to Baldur's Gate keeps me going."
Karlach,"Couldn't have said it better myself. Keep a bottle of something good in the ice box for me, huh? Mama K's coming home before too long."
Karlach,"Hell, I don't need luck. I've got the Blade of Avernus on my side."
Karlach,"Thanks soldier. I won't lie, I might need it."
Karlach,Who knows? Maybe we'll have it again some day. Maybe even sooner than you think.
Karlach,"Can I look you up, when I'm out?"
Karlach,"Hey, that would be kinda fun, no? High stakes hide and seek. Honestly I'd be curious to see if you could land a blow or two."
Karlach,"Gods, is it good to see you again - to be here, together. Hard not to get used to it all over again."
Karlach,This won't be the last time. I promise.
Karlach,"Pray to you, huh? I'll, uh... I'll consider that."
Karlach,Please. You know me. An absolute beast on the battlefield. I'll be fine - probably.
Karlach,"You don't need to ask, soldier."
Karlach,Every time.
Karlach,"I won't be in Avernus forever, you know. Can I look you up, when I'm out?"
Karlach,"Ah, soldier. How glad I am to see you again. I'd started to wonder if I ever would."
Karlach,"I'm sorry I haven't reached out. I guess I wasn't sure what you'd make of me. I've changed so much. But then again, you have too."
Karlach,"True enough. Though in this form, nothing seems impossible. Your adventures with Lae'zel must be absolutely fascinating."
Karlach,The role of the Ascendent suits you - though I admit I was wrong about you. I thought you were becoming less malicious during our travels - not more.
Karlach,There was a time I thought you'd seen another path for yourself. I thought perhaps the camaraderie we shared would sway you toward a gentler path.
Karlach,"But I'm not as naive as I once was. In fact, I've become someone quite different altogether."
Karlach,"Bittersweet, isn't it? You gave so much and lost so much, too."
Karlach,"And mine to them. I'd love to meet them some time, if it wouldn't be too... distressing for them."
Karlach,"Goodbye for now, soldier. Until we meet again - whether you like it or not."
Karlach,"You haven't seen the last of ol' Karlach yet, soldier."
Karlach,"Our current plan is to get in, grab a smith, and force him to fix old rusty - or maybe give me a brand new model that can live outside Avernus."
Karlach,I can hang on in the Hells a while longer. Oh! Guess what we found?
Karlach,"I'm just so glad you're doing all right. I've thought of you often, whenever I could spare half a thought. Surviving Avernus doesn't leave you much time to think."
Karlach,"As for the Avernus crew... man, that place is brutal."
Karlach,"Can't believe you really did it. Ascended. Wouldn't have picked that for you myself, but at least you look good."
Karlach,I don't even want to know what I look like. It's been hard in the Hells. As expected.
Karlach,"Mmm, you smell like a beautiful tree. I don't even want to know what I reek like. Fuel and imp guts, I'm sure."
Karlach,"Somehow we're both back where we started, despite everything in between."
Karlach,Me either. But I think my tin can can last a night before it's back to the Blood War.
Karlach,"Not that you asked, but guess what Wyll and I found in Avernus?"
Karlach,"Please, no! I don't want to draw any more attention from devils than I already have."
Karlach,"War's a dirty business, isn't it, soldier. I'd say we're both good at surviving it, but you may have a bit more zest for the whole thing."
Karlach,Good to know I didn't disappear completely when I left. I won't lie - it's been hard.
Karlach,But seeing you again reminds me what it's all for. Living - to keep living.
Karlach,You can't miss it! So... shiny.
Karlach,"Haven't seen any mind flayers anywhere in Avernus, I must say. Never thought I'd miss 'em. War's a dirty business."
Karlach,"Ah. War's a dirty business, soldier. It's been... exactly how you'd think."
Karlach,"But having Wyll around has been incredible. Fucker's even better at killing devils than yours truly. We don't have much time to chat, but just knowing he's there makes all the difference."
Karlach,"Oh, but hey! Guess what we found?"
Karlach,"Oh, but hey! Guess what I found?"
Karlach,I'd say so! Can't think of who's been carrying your pack now that K's out of commission.
Karlach,"Man, we had some good times. Wish Wyll and I had more time to reminisce, but surviving Avernus is just non-stop."
Karlach,"Still, having him there has been incredible. You really can get through anything with someone you love at your side."
Karlach,"Man, we had some good times. Wish I had more time to reminisce, but surviving Avernus is just non-stop."
Karlach,"My current plan is to get in, grab a smith, and force him to fix old rusty - or maybe give me a brand new model that can live outside Avernus."
Karlach,"No - believe me, you shouldn't have. That place is fucking horrible. I wouldn't wish it on you - on anyone."
Karlach,"But look, you showed me just how much my life is worth. That there are people out there who really value it."
Karlach,"There is time enough, if you still want - thanks to our efforts, of course."
Karlach,"Haunted poppet, haunted poppet."
Karlach,I'm not a naive kid anymore. And I don't take orders from you.
Karlach,"Ah, to be deemed worthy by the great Lae'zel of Crèche K'liir."
Karlach,"What are you, pirates?"
Karlach,Well tell your mates to keep their hoes out of Baldur's Gate.
Karlach,"That'll wake you up of a fine day, won't it."
Karlach,"True enough. Don't know why I'm rushing things, except the risk of imminent mind flayerisation. But hey, we've got a cure in the works, right? Right."
Karlach,Hah. I bet I could handle it. If you could handle the void-like Hell maw inside me.
Karlach,"I was just a kid, but I knew what she meant. I thought about it a lot while I was in the Hells."
Karlach,"'I will be,' she said. 'Just tending to my garden of sadness. Things have got rather overgrown.'"
Karlach,"Went in for a fresh seedloaf once, only to find her sitting on a stool with her head in her hands. I asked her if she was all right."
Karlach,"Eventine Grantz was her name. Halfling, ran the bakery in my neighbourhood in the Outer City."
Karlach,I have - had - this old friend. Really old. She must've been around a hundred and forty by the time I met her.
Karlach,So - bear with me.
Karlach,"Hey, soldier. You surprised me. For the best, I suppose. I was getting a little lost."
Karlach,"Fierce in battle, maybe a bit naive in... everything else."
Karlach,Makes sense. And how are you getting on out here in the world?
Karlach,I was the first - not the last. But most didn't survive the process.
Karlach,The others were all devilkin. I think I was the only lucky winner from Faerûn.
Karlach,Lucky me.
Karlach,"My mum used to call it that. Said to tread with care, cause every blade might've been fed by someone important to someone."
Karlach,"Nothing like it, right?"
Karlach,"Well, I'm going to tell you anyway."
Karlach,Too bad!
Karlach,"It's grass. Perfect, soft grave-hair. Heaven between the toes."
Karlach,"Rest up, soldier. Who knows what tomorrow's got in store for us?"
Karlach,Phew! Wouldn't mind shacking up in a place like this.
Karlach,"Ahh, smell that? Fresh forest air."
Karlach,Depends on the company.
Karlach,"Damn. I swore I'd never come back to the Hells, and here I am."
Karlach,Escaping fate happens to be my speciality.
Karlach,I'm ready for the goo.
Karlach,Think you might like to try it for yourself some time?
Karlach,Let me get one last look at you in case the brain bug  takes us in the night. There. Got it.
Karlach,"You can take a day off once in a while, Lae'zel."
Karlach,"Sorry, I forgot about your delicate sensibilities. But you know what? I wouldn't change a thing about you."
Karlach,"Thanks for lending me your ear, soldier. I'll unbend it now. But I appreciate it."
Karlach,"We'd better. Running out of days, aren't we?"
Karlach,"Around you? Tall order. But if you've got an idea, I'm all ears."
Karlach,"Ugh, I'm terrible at this. What should we do now?"
Karlach,"What a sight. We should stop for a nice little lunch, take it all in."
Karlach,"Well... you may feel shitty, but you look pretty good from where I'm standing. Now - let's get some shut-eye before I say something I regret and lie awake in rictus horror all night."
Karlach,"But you look pretty good yourself, I have to say. Now - let's get some shut-eye before I say something I regret and lie awake in rictus horror all night."
Karlach,Sure it's not the hellfire? 
Karlach,"We better get some shut-eye if we're going to face whatever's coming our way tomorrow. At the rate things are going, I expect nothing less than something totally unexpected."
Karlach,"Well. Let no one say we led boring lives, if nothing else."
Karlach,"Maybe this is how the squiddie fuckers get you. They put a pep in your step, then burst out of your skull when you least expect it."
Karlach,"Sleep on it, maybe. If you've thought of something by morning, I'd love to know. For now, it's enough just to know you care enough to try."
Karlach,"We can try. But don't hurt those pretty lips of yours, all right? They feature heavily in my future plans."
Karlach,Ngh - wait! NO! 
Karlach,Are you all right?!
Karlach,"You have no idea. If I weren't so worried about killing you, I'd be in a puddle on the floor."
Karlach,"I told you, I'm an 'at your own risk' attraction. Make better decisions."
Karlach,You can't make me be the responsible one. I'll destroy us both.
Karlach,So what do we do now?
Karlach,"Then again, I feel pretty good. Strong. You know? "
Karlach,"An extra vicious one, I think. No one buried their dead."
Karlach,And right now I want to ride you 'til you see stars.
Karlach,"I'm free now. Incredible, isn't it? And I can have whatever I want."
Karlach,"Ugh, GODS, I want to ride you 'til you see stars."
Karlach,Don't hold it against me. Unless you want to.
Karlach,The future. I foresee... sunny days - lots of them. A little place in the city. And more adventures with the likes of you.
Karlach,Sorry if I was a little forward. Ten years in Avernus and I guess I've forgotten whatever manners I might've had.
Karlach,Don't tempt me. It isn't fair.
Karlach,The best worst decision. So what do we do now?
Karlach,"Shit, are you all right?"
Karlach,My turn.
Karlach,"Please. My life is an instant mood-killer, and I'm enjoying this mood. Maybe even a little too much."
Karlach,"Haven't read a book since I was a kid. Not a lot of exciting fiction in Avernus. Tell you what, you find one you think I should read, and I'll check it out."
Karlach,I know. What I want and what I can have are two very different things. 
Karlach,Hells yes! You're HERE!
Karlach,"Damn, I'm so fucking happy to be back."
Karlach,"Only blades there are bloody. When I stumbled off that nautiloid and onto the banks of the Chionthar, the first thing I did was find something green to fall in."
Karlach,"Guess we ought to rest up, eh soldier? If today's been any indication, tomorrow's going to keep us on our toes."
Karlach,And proud.
Karlach,"Damn straight we are. I've got a lot of living to do, and I'm going to need my horn for most of it."
Karlach,"If I turn into a mind flayer tomorrow, I'll at least have gone out on a high note."
Karlach,"Guess you can't have it all. To be honest, a fire, a bit of nature, and a bedroll of my own is more than enough - more than I thought I'd ever have."
Karlach,"Either way, it's pretty interesting. If I turn into a mind flayer tomorrow, I can't say it wasn't an exciting ride."
Karlach,"You can say that again. Weird turn after weird turn, with the occasional twist of luck on top. Someone out there's either looking out for us, or fucking with us."
Karlach,Rough. You've seen Avernus - nothing but rocks and evil pricks as far as the eye can see.
Karlach,Haven't gone camping since I was a little girl. Very exciting.
Karlach,Take no prisoners.
Karlach,May they rest in peace.
Karlach,"Well, well. Who's buried here?"
Karlach,"And miss a good barroom brawl? Not me, sir."
Karlach,"Very good! Break out that lute, bard - I'm in the mood for a song."
Karlach,Bad luck to turn a bard away from a campfire. Just saying.
Karlach,"Hang on, weren't you living in the sewer?"
Karlach,And he's always looked the exact same? No chance Jaheira's been swapping him out every few years?
Karlach,"Whoever it is, just talk to them, Gale. And leave out the hypotheticals."
Karlach,"So, Gale - got any book recommendations for me?"
Karlach,Very funny. Yes - I can read. School put me off big boring tomes. Sometimes I wonder what I'm missing.
Karlach,"Ooh! Something with magic, please. And no devils."
Karlach,"How's the orb treating you, Gale?"
Karlach,I can only imagine.
Karlach,"Hey, soldier. Doing the rounds?"
Karlach,"Doing all right, Gale?"
Karlach,Whoa! Almost slipped there.
Karlach,You gonna catch me if I eat a brick?
Karlach,Just when I was getting used to the sky again...
Karlach,I can almost reconstruct this battle in my mind. Unfortunately.
Karlach,Tsk. Poor man.
Karlach,I smell a fight brewing.
Karlach,I feel it too. Here if you need a pick-me-up.
Karlach,"Baby, I'm nothing if not frolicsome."
Karlach,"Almost went to chat up the githyanki myself, but then I thought - you know what, Karlach? You don't need to lose a finger tonight. You just got home."
Karlach,"Astarion's a riot, isn't he? Reminds me of a noble I knew back in the Gate. Wit like a dagger, hair like my granny."
Karlach,"Granted this isn't the world's best spot for grassing, but I've taken my opportunities where I could."
Karlach,I didn't escape the Hells to lose my soul to another evil. I can't be part of this anymore.
Karlach,"Oh my gods, grass. Perfect, soft, grave-hair. Feels like heaven between the toes."
Karlach,And do you want to know my favourite part?
Karlach,"And it is, in loads of places. But here? Here we've got it all."
Karlach,"Good gods, you ain't lying."
Karlach,"Well, I'm certainly part of it! The breeze, the fire, me big stupid head. I love it here. So much."
Karlach, State opinion 
Karlach, Happy Agreement 
Karlach, Sad Disagreement 
Karlach,Never say no to a bard. They'll write all sorts of mean shit about you.
Karlach,"Yes! And the fire, and a faint murmur in the distance. I love it here. So much."
Karlach,Crackling fire. A little breeze. I love it here. So much.
Karlach,Hear that?
Karlach,"Fair enough, buddy. Home is where the heart is, anyway."
Karlach,I don't know what that means.
Karlach,This place is so peaceful. Maybe I should convert.
Karlach,"You're doing a good job keeping this merry band of freaks together. Good leaders are hard to come by, you know."
Karlach,"Never thought I'd be so keen to take orders from a future mind flayer. But that's tomorrow's problem, isn't it? Right now I'm not worried about anything but where these pyjamas came from."
Karlach,"Me either. I've got a lot of living to do, and I'm going to need my horn for most of it."
Karlach,A-thank you. Very happy indeed.
Karlach,"Gale's pretty lost in his thoughts, isn't he. Poor guy. Roughing it like this can't be his style."
Karlach,"Couldn't help but overhear you and Shadowheart earlier. She's a little prickly, but I like her."
Karlach,"I considered going to make nice with Wyll, but I thought he might want a little space from little old me."
Karlach,"Hey, soldier. Doing the rounds before bed, ey?"
Karlach,"You're old as sin, right Halsin? You must have lots of good stories."
Karlach,Sleep and adventure. Maybe I'll come back as a bear in some future life.
Karlach,"So, erm, Jaheira. Do you like to... that is, what do you like to do?"
Karlach,I'm just picturing you strumming on a harp so hard the strings snap and trying not to shriek. What do you play?
Karlach,These Steel Watchers are big as hell.
Karlach,I'd give my other horn to watch that.
Karlach,Nothing but the win.
Karlach,That sounds like heaven! Wait. Used to?
Karlach,You've got slaves to manage your sanitation. Baldur's Gate doesn't. Though we do rely quite heavily on kobolds.
Karlach,I'll turn you to charcoal. Guaranteed.
Karlach,To have someone who cares about you and throw them away. I don't know how you do it.
Karlach,You're cute.
Karlach,So - why Night Orchids? 
Karlach,It looks good on you.
Karlach,It's all over your face.
Karlach,"You look happy, Shadowheart. Like a Night Orchid in bloom."
Karlach,I don't want to think about that. I just want to enjoy whatever comes my way.
Karlach,Atta girl.
Karlach,"Since you're the only one in good form out here, I'll trust you to lead the way, Shadowheart."
Karlach,A compliment from Shadowheart! I'll put it on the shelf with the rest of my achievements.
Karlach,I can tell when we're getting close to a mind flayer area because everything starts to smell purple.
Karlach,"Let's go blast a brine pool, then."
Karlach,Prisoners!
Karlach,Huh. Pretty good idea.
Karlach,I'll try to keep my fire a gentle throb.
Karlach,"Dark enough for you, Shadowheart?"
Karlach,Yes ma'am.
Karlach,I need to catch up with that mechanic. And pray he's extremely good.
Karlach,There might not be a fix at all. What then?
Karlach,Then... well. We live. Every second until the last. That's all there is to it.
Karlach,I'm sure it'll be fine. It'll be fine! It'll be fine.
Karlach,"Gods, this thing's hot. "
Karlach,Might not hurt to say a prayer or two.
Karlach,I've had enough tragedy in my day. You have too. But Shar's got you in a chokehold.
Karlach,"No reason. Wrong place, wrong time."
Karlach,"Your nose is better than mine, pal."
Karlach,"But I guess it doesn't matter. Can't change the past, and right now, the only thing that matters is how fucking hot this thing is getting."
Karlach,Uh... fish?
Karlach,"Better yet, I'll get my axe to ask his brain, directly."
Karlach,But I'll need to live long enough to make it to the city. That means surviving a little longer.
Karlach,I'm sweating bullets. What if I blow our cover?
Karlach,If I'd done things just a little different... if I'd seen the signs...
Karlach,And it might not get better. But you know what? I'm not done here yet. Not yet.
Karlach,Whatever.
Karlach,Me too!
Karlach,"You know, even devils like a good joke. Why are Sharrans so... dour?"
Karlach,The loss of all joy. Sad business.
Karlach,No shadow curse here. Wonder why.
Karlach,"Always something, isn't it."
Karlach,"If you get married, I'm your celebrant. Got it?"
Karlach,"Two of my real friends, finding real happiness? Together? Beautiful."
Karlach,"Seeing you happy is pretty wonderful, Wyll."
Karlach,Mizora. Zariel's lapdog.
Karlach,"Ah, dance, the true language of love."
Karlach,"Used to your new look yet, Wyll? I for one think you look smashing."
Karlach,"I've taken more pleasant shits than you, Mizora, and at least those can be buried after."
Karlach,"Well yeah! One thing I'll say for the Hells, the gossip is excellent. Faerûn's a funeral parlour by comparison."
Karlach,What about?
Karlach,Couldn't find you for a while at the party. Was hoping we could regale our friends with a nice three-horned duet.
Karlach,Heroics don't leave half enough time for messing.
Karlach,"Care for a dip, Wyll?"
Karlach,You reckon right. Maybe for the best though. My singing is worse than demonic screeching.
Karlach,Must be lovely to have a swim without boiling all the fishes alive.
Karlach,Don't ask me to make a hot spring for you two. It might work. But I also might cook you like lobsters.
Karlach,Never knew Sharrans to be so... military.
Karlach,Problem with eternal wars is they never end.
Karlach,Feel that? Guards are giving us the stink-eye.
Karlach,Think they recognise you?
Karlach,"Exactly so, your majesty."
Karlach,Then let's go digging.
Karlach,'The Blade of Frontiers.' That's what you were called before I barrelled into your life and nearly ruined it. And look at you now.
Karlach,"Well, well! You may get a curtsy out of me yet, Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard."
Karlach,You're speaking my language.
Karlach,Think the bar is open?
Karlach,"You're good at staying in character, I'll give you that."
Karlach,Do I hear... music?
Karlach,With my new best friend on my tail the whole time. Who knew.
Karlach,"Yes, because every function comes with a handy switch."
Karlach,It feels... awful.
Karlach,"But if I keep thinking that way, this thing's going to burn me clean out before dawn."
Karlach,"Hey, so, what's romance like in the Underdark, Minthara?"
Karlach,Karlach reaction
Karlach,"You and me both, pal."
Karlach,What a pesthole! Can't wait to clear this place out.
Karlach,"You know what, Lae? I couldn't agree more."
Karlach,"C'mon, isn't there something you hate for no good reason?"
Karlach,"You know, I've always kind of hated this place. Such ado about a damned bridge."
Karlach,"She never stops, does she. Not for a second."
Karlach,Beautiful. Lethal. The Underdark is everything I thought it'd be. 
Karlach,"Psst! Hey soldier - you aren't asleep, are you?"
Karlach,"Damn, you're right. The eyes see what the heart wants."
Karlach,Do I see light? Or am I delusional?
Karlach,"I'm buzzing, honestly. I couldn't wait to talk to you."
Karlach,"It's good to see you smiling, Lae'zel."
Karlach,Heya soldier - I think everyone's asleep. May I?
Karlach,"Hello, you. I've been waiting for this all night."
Karlach,The soldier's sweat? Or the lover's?
Karlach,"Next time I'm injured, don't heal, just turn me off and on again."
Karlach,"You know how much time I spent in the hells, right? Of course I've been scared!"
Karlach,I kept on going though. Knew there'd be better days on the other side - and here they are.
Karlach,"Ugh, I'm sorry - I shouldn't tease you - or myself. I'd give anything to touch you, but I can't. Not until I can be sure I won't burn you."
Karlach,"Is this your first time on the Sword Coast, Lae'zel?"
Karlach,"Oh, now you're just teasing me. Evil."
Karlach,Karlach get rid of her/hear her out
Karlach,Just wait till you see Baldur's Gate. You'll never want to leave.
Karlach,Guess not. I just feel what I feel. No sense hiding it.
Karlach,"Lae'zel, do you want to talk about what happened at the crèche?"
Karlach,Fair enough. But if you change your mind...
Karlach,"When I look at you, I feel real again. Alive. Gods, I want to ride you 'til you see stars."
Karlach,So githyanki undergarments. Very fashionable.
Karlach,"Thank the gods. I was afraid I was the only one. Ten years is a long time to be trapped in the Hells. Ten years without a kind word, a touch."
Karlach,"Honey, when I look at you, my brain turns to mush."
Karlach,"Without a mechanic, I might need to get used to the feeling of slowly burning to ash."
Karlach,"It's funny seeing you so smitten, Minthara. Didn't think you were able."
Karlach,I wouldn't mind doing a little shopping in the city.
Karlach,Sometimes I wish I weren't.
Karlach,Cause I'm tough enough to take it.
Karlach,"Gods dammit, Zariel. Gortash. Why'd you have to pick me?"
Karlach,My gods. That's hot. My engine's really cooking with fire.
Karlach,"And if my engine keeps burning this hot, it might be lights out sooner than I think."
Karlach,Home. I'm nearly there. It's almost over.
Karlach,"If this thing's burning out, I'd like to do it in Baldur's Gate."
Karlach,"Sweaty, but grateful. Good gods, this thing is hot. And getting hotter."
Karlach,I'm so grateful.
Karlach,Give me an aboleth over a midge any day.
Karlach,"Come out, come out, wherever you are, Gortash. Karlach's coming home."
Karlach,That motherfucker doomed the wrong girl.
Karlach,"Gortash is going to be so happy to see me, right up until I melt his face like a candle."
Karlach,I'm going home. And whatever happens after that is between me and the so-called gods.
Karlach,"But hey. If this is how I go out - saving the city, protecting everything I love from everything I hate - that'll do me."
Karlach,"Dammon might be able to do a little something, but at this point... I don't know. My engine feels cooked."
Karlach,"But hey, I made it to the city. That'll do me. Whatever comes after that is between me and the so-called gods."
Karlach,Bloody Zariel. I won't let her take Wyll!
Karlach,Huh. There's something going on here. I don't like it.
Karlach,Careful. I smell an ambush.
Karlach,Holy fucking hells.
Karlach,Gotta respect these gith. They don't fool around.
Karlach,"In that case, lead on, miss."
Karlach,Oh no.
Karlach,"Ah, Wyll, your horns are deadly! So much character."
Karlach,"Before I went to Avernus, I'd have agreed with you. Nothing quite like Baldur's Gate, is there?"
Karlach,Hey! Something bit me.
Karlach,"Ngh - gods, this thing wants to burn out. Not sure it's ever felt worse."
Karlach,"Doubting myself has always been a fool's errand. What Karlach wants, Karlach gets."
Karlach,Everything but the thing I want the most - my heart back.
Karlach,But hey. We've all got to go one way or another. And I plan to go out with a bang.
Karlach,"Ahh. Flowers, leaves, grass. Can't beat it."
Karlach,"Man, adventuring is thirsty work."
Karlach,"Good night, sleep tight, don't let the lemures bite."
Karlach,"We're not taking a boat to Baldur's Gate, right?"
Karlach,Oh - of course. I'm sorry if I misunderstood. 
Karlach,I'm yours. Completely.
Karlach,Are you all right? Did I say something wrong?
Karlach,You might have to show me how 'slow' works.
Karlach,Later. I promise. Right now I just... I just can't.
Karlach,"You said it. But... when I'm with you, all that seems manageable. If I can have you, I'll take the rest."
Karlach,Fuck yes I am. Especially while my ultimate fantasy is right within reach.
Karlach,Feather in my cap that I've survived this long without being able to be close to you.
Karlach,"Gods be damned, it's a good day to be alive."
Karlach,"You're in charge, soldier. Hey, I have an idea."
Karlach,"Avernus was bad. But being here and unable to touch you for so long was worse, damn it."
Karlach,Feather in my cap that I lasted this long.
Karlach,"You know, it does. There's always a bit of a veil about you - I guess it's the magic, but there's something else, too. Something I want to discover first-hand."
Karlach,"Same as they all were, I suppose. Quick to flare, quick to fade."
Karlach,Oh man! WHIZBANGS!
Karlach,"You're missing out! Loved it as a kid. This water looks nasty as hell, though."
Karlach,"Can you swim, Astarion?"
Karlach,"I never really had a chance to grow out of my 'if it moves, climb aboard' dating strategy. I was still in the middle of figuring all that out when Gortash sent me to Avernus."
Karlach,Hmm. Maybe I like slow after all. So erm... can I kiss you now?
Karlach,You and Mizora. Wow. Just wow.
Karlach,"Ma'am, you've been inspiring me since I was yea high."
Karlach,Do you really expect me to choke down that obvious bullshit?
Karlach,"I never was a sucker for a smooth-talker, but I admit, Astarion, you're pretty slick."
Karlach,"All good, fangs."
Karlach,I'm sure that's true. But it doesn't change the way it makes me feel.
Karlach,Excuse you. I didn't need that prick to make me who I am.
Karlach,"Aww, thanks."
Karlach,I really made it out of Avernus. It's incredible.
Karlach,"Kill the monsters, save the townsfolk, sweep the local hellbeast off her feet?"
Karlach,Hahaha. Ha!
Karlach,"Say it loud: 'I'm yours, Karlach.'"
Karlach,My name sounds so good in your mouth.
Karlach,You're right. Small talk is for small people. And we loom large. But still - first date. So let's make with the first-dating.
Karlach,"It does. There's so much about you I don't know, but I'm hungry for every part of it."
Karlach,The echoes - listen! They're coming from three directions!
Karlach,I'd like to take you to bed now.
Karlach,Ho. He-llo! Hey!
Karlach,(Oh man! Whizbangs!)
Karlach,"Hmm. Partially. On the one hand, you're dangerous temptation itself. On the other, there's something very frank about you. Something familiar."
Karlach,I'm not sure. I feel like I saw the heart of you from the very beginning. And I've had a piece of you with me ever since.
Karlach,"Everything about you is new to me, honey. You're the first gith I've met, sure, but you're also singular in the world for so many other reasons."
Karlach,"Hmm. Ask me a question, maybe. A getting-to-know-you type question."
Karlach,"With you, though - having to wait for someone I wanted so bad. I didn't know I could tolerate so much anticipation."
Karlach,Here's to living every day like it's our last.
Karlach,"Sorry, sorry. Hope they don't stain. Care to raise your glass to that?"
Karlach,"But you're in charge, soldier. Help me: what comes next? I might be a little out of my depth here."
Karlach,I'm happy with halfway. Or a quarter of the way. Or any part of the way you're happy with.
Karlach,"Present company excluded, of course?"
Karlach,I know what you mean. Everyone is so... unhappy.
Karlach,"If you like, we can just lay together...? Clothes on and everything. I just want to be near you."
Karlach,"C'mon and c'mere, you. I've already spent too much time without you in my arms."
Karlach,Hope you like it.
Karlach,Oh - I'm sorry if I... never mind. You're right. 
Karlach,"Sister, you've got a deal."
Karlach,"But hey, maybe we can scare up a few dusty bottles of wine somewheres."
Karlach,Like a... creature. Pulse. Heat. Desire.
Karlach,"I rented us a room for the whole night. Just the two of us - alone, finally."
Karlach,Wouldn't blame the gobs. Place looks like it's been abandoned a good while.
Karlach,Sleep well. I'll try to do the same.
Karlach,We'll chat in the morning. Sleep well.
Karlach,Soldier's honour. Being next to you right now... it's almost more than I can take.
Karlach,I want to touch you as deeply as you can be touched. I want you to be mine - completely.
Karlach,"I just want to be with you, however you like. You're in control."
Karlach,But what if I really enjoy being distracted from the task ahead?
Karlach,I hope you know that I'm yours. Completely. And I'd like to take you to bed now.
Karlach,True! Then let's say you... brought me to my knees.
Karlach,Yeah but look at these mountains. The height of temptation.
Karlach,Really now?
Karlach,Looks like I need to find a more active way to entertain you.
Karlach,"Feather in my cap, says I."
Karlach,Me too. Would you believe me if I said this was probably the best day I've ever had?
Karlach,You might be right.
Karlach,Hearty? Shadsy? Or maybe just The Fringe?
Karlach,"Hey, Shaddy, got a quick question about the best way to treat an infernal burn."
Karlach,Even I'm not desperate enough to fuck an imp.
Karlach,Cheer up. It might be all downhill from here.
Karlach,But no - there wasn't anyone.  Couldn't risk it. Had to survive. And look - it all worked out.
Karlach,Would you believe me if I said this was probably the best day of my life?
Karlach,"Whatever you say, squirrelheart."
Karlach,I mean... I guess.
Karlach,"This is getting difficult, you know. Being this close to you. It's almost more than I can take."
Karlach,Look at that. Not even a light singeing. 
Karlach,"I figured as much, being the proud owner of eyes."
Karlach,"... sorry, no need for that. Must've put too much salt on my blood sausage this morning."
Karlach,"I figured as much, what with my one good eye for seeing and fingers for counting."
Karlach,Phew. My mum always said the Chionthar was unlucky.
Karlach,"Since I met you, all I wanted to do was touch you. Now that I can, I never want to let you go."
Karlach,"Met a loumara demon who married a mountain, though. It's a thing."
Karlach,"Gods, we're terrible at this. This was supposed to be a first date, but it's all I can do to keep my hands to myself."
Karlach,Was it everything you thought it'd be?
Karlach,...and two glasses of water.
Karlach,I've Heard of her - and everyone knows the Guild. They're not bad if you know how to work 'em.
Karlach,Huh. Really?
Karlach,"Minsc, you come from an entire nation of berserkers. Give me some of those good Rashemaar pointers."
Karlach,"I can barely look at that devil, much less touch her. How could you be so reckless?"
Karlach,So our vamp isn't so heartless after all.
Karlach,It suits you beautifully.
Karlach,Friends? What do you mean?
Karlach,"I'm sorry, but I don't have time for that. Literally. I care about you, but I'm not going to chase after you."
Karlach,I get it. I didn't mean to overstep. There's just so much I want to do in the little time I have left.
Karlach,"If this is it for us, I accept that. But I'd like to find someone who's keen to have a nice meal with me while I still can."
Karlach,I'm sure you can understand that.
Karlach,I need a minute. I need a lot of minutes. Please.
Karlach,"Wait, what?"
Karlach,"Well, what can I say? Hail Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard."
Karlach,...and two cups of tea.
Karlach,"They'll be fine, I promise."
Karlach,All set?
Karlach,"A little inn in the city - the Singing Lute, it's called. If it's anything like it used to be, we'll have the place all to ourselves."
Karlach,"I'm buying, all right? Let it be said, let it be written, let it be done."
Karlach,"Hup hup, eh? I haven't got forever."
Karlach,"You know, Astarion, I'm not sure I can trust you anymore. You're... different. A bit scary, to be honest."
Karlach,"Treat them right, or you'll have me to answer to."
Karlach,I can whittle up a good stake in no time if the mood takes me.
Karlach,"Looks like this town was ransacked - by soldiers, if my eyes don't deceive me."
Karlach,Must've been an awful day for the people who lived here.
Karlach,"Man, it's good to be home. First round on who?"
Karlach,"Hate to say it, Wyll - but I agree with the mind flayer. Baldur's Gate doesn't need a dragon - it needs you."
Karlach,Take it from me - people might take one look at you and start running their mouths. But you don't need them. You can do this.
Karlach,"Even crazier than that, if you can believe it."
Karlach,"You won't pin me down with a rhyme, wizard!"
Karlach,You should've thought of that before you got close to that devil. Did you forget who she works for? Did you forget what Zariel did to me?
Karlach,"If there's anyone I trust to run this city, Wyll, it's you."
Karlach,Ready to enter the belly of the beast?
Karlach,You must have good taste. Not me. Can't afford it.
Karlach,"Sorry if this is rude, but... can vampires fall in love?"
Karlach,Huh. A brewery. Why does Reithwin Ale ring a bell?
Karlach,"Like... as many Boo-brains as a mortal mind can fathom. It's an elder brain, after all. You heard of those?"
Karlach,Sunbathe? Swim?
Karlach,"In that case, welcome home."
Karlach,Never was my strong suit.
Karlach,I was just being nice.
Karlach,Don't keep me waiting too long!
Karlach,"Sure. The trick is to let them mess with you just once, and show 'em what happens. They won't try again."
Karlach,"A duo of your finest gruel, please. And two glasses of..."
Karlach,Say you'll go. My treat.
Karlach,"Two pumpkin stews, my good man. And two glasses of..."
Karlach,"Honestly, I'm not completely sure. But I know it'll be no match for you, me, and the hamster."
Karlach,Just what I had in mind.
Karlach,"Two of the rothé ribs, please. And two glasses of..."
Karlach,Listen to you. You have no idea what you're talking about.
Karlach,"Why's that even on the menu? Then again, if it's good enough for you, I suppose it's good enough for me too."
Karlach,Good to know love is on the table though.
Karlach,I need... I need a minute.
Karlach,Nice and light. Sounds perfect.
Lae'zel,"It threatens all of us, gith and mud worlder alike. But even the brightest blaze can be extinguished."
Lae'zel,"- seeing your wonderful, hideous face brings me more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head."
Lae'zel,"And by the looks of it, its riches have gone unplundered."
Lae'zel,"Nothing but allies, I always told myself. A necessary partnership. But in spite of every strained word, every barbed glance -"
Lae'zel,- seeing Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard brings me even more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head.
Lae'zel,"I gave you my faith, and you called me traitor. I gave you my life, and you ordered your knights to hunt me."
Lae'zel,"Renegades are rare, but not unheard of. Omeluum is one such creature."
Lae'zel,- seeing the Blade of Avernus brings me even more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head.
Lae'zel,"Mother Gith's son lives, caged by a prison of your design. Our people deserve the truth - but you have denied it to us."
Lae'zel,"Were it not for you, I might not have known the value of partnership. Connection."
Lae'zel,Get to the point. Why are you here?
Lae'zel,"Renegades are rare, but not unheard of."
Lae'zel,"Your loyalty to her knows no bounds. Nor, it seems, does your fortitude."
Lae'zel,"You impressed me from the beginning, you know. It was my own foolish pride that ever kept me from admitting it - to you, or myself."
Lae'zel,Don't worry. You're more useful to me alive.
Lae'zel,"Of course I'll be welcomed. And if you behave, you may keep your head too."
Lae'zel,"I have seen the truth. I reject you, Queen of Lies - I will not be your puppet."
Lae'zel,"I've found new allies, now. New... friends. People I trust, and who trust me in return."
Lae'zel,Sacrifice.
Lae'zel,'Orpheus rallied Gith's honour guard and declared the throne for himself. The War of the Comet had begun.'
Lae'zel,"Even my people know the value of a carefully crafted coalition, Minthara. Is our own alliance not a case in point?"
Lae'zel,And I pity your faithless mind.
Lae'zel,"'The Prince of the Comet, Part Three.'"
Lae'zel,"'Vlaakith's faithful roar out this tale. But beneath the roars, we hear whispers carrying truth and prophecy.'"
Lae'zel,My hopes are only ever as strong as the woman standing before me now.
Lae'zel,"My story is yours now, Karlach. It may never be written in the githyanki slates, but it will be legendary all the same."
Lae'zel,"Truth or not, it matters no longer. Orpheus is fallen. Vlaakith reigns supreme."
Lae'zel,"Incredible tale. I wouldn't have believed it, if we hadn't seen the prince for ourselves."
Lae'zel,"But seeing you here tonight, your eyes so bright, your smile so wide - nothing could bring me more joy than that."
Lae'zel,A mere shadow of a creature - yet it hears the Absolute's voice?
Lae'zel,A profane tale. These lies must perish with the prince who told them.
Lae'zel,And yet - what if it's true? Could the City of Death have risen from a single Great Lie?
Lae'zel,We've heard word of a githyanki outpost hidden deep in Chult. The last of Vlaakith's Sword Coast strongholds.
Lae'zel,Out of my head - the Queen has spoken!
Lae'zel,The slate holds the truth. The prince still comes for his throne.
Lae'zel,"The ones who triumph earn a place in githyanki society. The one's who don't, perish."
Lae'zel,We'll meet again. The Hells are too small to contain a soul as tremendous as yours.
Lae'zel,"She - she has good reason, surely. Vlaakith is my faith, my - my very purpose."
Lae'zel,This may be the last time we come together. Make these moments count.
Lae'zel,But maybe the teachings weren't real. Maybe Vlaakith betrayed Gith and seized control.
Lae'zel,The Undying Queen. Honour be!
Lae'zel,"These writings are pure propaganda, the work of an insidious apostate."
Lae'zel,Say nothing. Avert your eyes.
Lae'zel,"Perhaps you might join us. Help us raze it to the ground, put those godly powers to good use."
Lae'zel,I don't want your pity. I don't want your mercy. I want you gone from this place.
Lae'zel,Leave.
Lae'zel,Dear Karlach. I thought slicing through the wings of a pit fiend would by the pinnacle of my month.
Lae'zel,Think back on your lessons. Maybe you've learned how to unravel the cipher.
Lae'zel,It's time - you deserve your freedom from the fires. I can't believe it's almost in reach.
Lae'zel,And still you best me at every turn. I could build a fortress the size of Castle Susurrus with all the horns you've ripped from rampaging orthons.
Lae'zel,I've slaughtered more fiends in the last month than I thought swarmed the whole of Avernus.
Lae'zel,"It's incredible, isn't it? To be anywhere but sizzling in the hottest of Hells."
Lae'zel,"It's just a story, as harmless as it is far-fetched."
Lae'zel,"An army's worth of slithering parasites. Sickness, waiting to spread."
Lae'zel,But maybe the teachings weren't real. Maybe Orpheus lives to this day.
Lae'zel,Use the cipher you found to reveal the true meaning.
Lae'zel,Perhaps you might join us - sneak in under cover of night. We slit every last throat and you feed until your belly's full.
Lae'zel,- seeing the Blade of Frontiers brings me even more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head.
Lae'zel,- seeing you brings me even more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head.
Lae'zel,It shouldn't take much effort to decipher it. And... there. From madness rises meaning.
Lae'zel,I have performed deeds well and efficiently. Is this what you mean?
Lae'zel,I'm proud of you. Always was.
Lae'zel,"Ah, the cipher. I can use it to bring un-muddle this mess. Yes, I see shape, I see structure. I see - a story."
Lae'zel,I - I just wanted you to know that.
Lae'zel,Pucker and peck all you like. Don't assume I care to watch.
Lae'zel,"Venerable Vlaakith. Please, I beg you to listen. I seek -"
Lae'zel,"Before you ask: yes, he is safe - in the care of people I trust."
Lae'zel,Hmm. You have given me ideas...
Lae'zel,Vlaakith? Get out of my camp. You're not welcome here.
Lae'zel,"Xan will be a fine warrior, if he chooses. Or a poet, or an explorer, or a scholar."
Lae'zel,"You say 'stuck' - and still you stay. Your devotion to Karlach knows no bounds. Nor, it seems, does your fortitude."
Lae'zel,'The Prince of the Comet is not dead.<br>The Prince of the Comet will come again.<br>The Prince of the Comet will liberate us from Vlaakith's tyranny.'
Lae'zel,"Ah. Well, a harsh 'no' is as reasonable an answer as any. I wasn't always the most... gracious ally. But there's something I'd have you know:"
Lae'zel,"You impressed me from the beginning. It was my own foolish pride that ever kept me from admitting it - to you, or myself."
Lae'zel,"'Praise be to Mother Gith, Queen of the One Sky! Praise be to your son Orpheus, the True Heir, Prince of the Comet!'"
Lae'zel,"The story is true - Orpheus is free. And right here, right now, we are writing its next chapter."
Lae'zel,"We know how this story truly ends. With the death of the prince, and a throne left unchallenged."
Lae'zel,Vlaakith has reigned unchallenged for millennia. Freeing Orpheus could be the first strike in a new war - as well as its last.
Lae'zel,Our path leads to Z'rell. Let us not keep her waiting.
Lae'zel,"No, no. Gith's son died to Voss' blade. Orpheus is no more."
Lae'zel,A projection this powerful? Impossible - isn't it?
Lae'zel,"By Mother Gith's Blade, I wish you could join us."
Lae'zel,And yet you live. Zariel could never hope to slaughter a soul as tremendous as yours.
Lae'zel,"But every glyph is bent or mirrored, every symbol disordered. I can make no sense of it -"
Lae'zel,"We need no boon for morale - I fight well when there is kin at my side. And now, I count one more among them."
Lae'zel,"I never imagined we'd be standing toe to toe on this day, in this place."
Lae'zel,*Sigh* I suppose you are right. We have seen too much black and red these last months. 
Lae'zel,Amusing? Wherein lies the humour?
Lae'zel,"I learned much from my time with you in Faerûn. For instance, that battle is more brutal - and the celebration after more glorious - with a fiery companion at your side."
Lae'zel,I'm glad to know it.
Lae'zel,Your words carry truth - I will meet you in Baldur's Gate.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith's demise? I should run you through for suggesting it.
Lae'zel,I learned much from my time in Faerûn. Battle is more brutal - and the celebration after more glorious - with a fiery companion at your side.
Lae'zel,Your loyalty is noted but not commended.
Lae'zel,"I couldn't wish for a life more furious, more bloody, and more fitting for a gith warrior - or a battle partner as mighty as Karlach."
Lae'zel,"This one is trouble. Watch your back, as she's likely to stab it."
Lae'zel,- but seeing you brings me more pleasure than gutting every last hellfiend of Avernus.
Lae'zel,I thought slicing through the wings of a pit fiend would by the pinnacle of my month -
Lae'zel,Would you look at that. 
Lae'zel,No more words. This camp will be your grave.
Lae'zel,Enjoy your next breath. It will be your last.
Lae'zel,Madness. You flood me with this... this heresy.
Lae'zel,As if you would have done differently.
Lae'zel,"Do not be so impatient to move on as Halsin. As ever, the githyanki crèche remains our priority."
Lae'zel,I'll let you leave this camp alive. But I can promise nothing more.
Lae'zel,"But Avernus may not be her forever home. There's a chance - well, you should speak with her yourself, if you haven't already."
Lae'zel,"Well, like it or not, I learned much from my time with you in Faerûn. For instance, that battle is more brutal - and the celebration after more glorious - with a fiery companion at your side."
Lae'zel,"Ah - a curmudgeon tonight, are we? Is that the right word - 'curmudgeon'?"
Lae'zel,"I was afforded a destiny of my own choosing. When he comes of age, it is only right I give Xan the same."
Lae'zel,It won't be long before he's doing the tearing - if that's what he wishes.
Lae'zel,"Speak. You have my ear, as Mother Gith taught us."
Lae'zel,My own queen hunts me. Why in the hells should I listen to you?
Lae'zel,She bests me at every turn. I could build a fortress the size of Castle Susurrus with all the horns she's ripped from rampaging orthons.
Lae'zel,Who is this 'seed of Vlaakith's demise'?
Lae'zel,"I'm not giving you the Astral Prism, if that's what you're wanting."
Lae'zel,I am no slave. It is Vlaakith who will purify me and ascend me.
Lae'zel,"And before you ask, yes, he is safe. I keep him secure in a portable hole - and have torn new openings into every fiend that's wandered anywhere near."
Lae'zel,Who is the person inside the Prism?
Lae'zel,So it has - and a fine man the hatchling will be. I call him Xan. 'Freedom'.
Lae'zel,"My story is Karlach's now. It may never be written in the githyanki slates, but it will be legendary all the same."
Lae'zel,"What are you asking of me, Voss?"
Lae'zel,"Worth it, I'd say. Right here, right now, there's no other place I'd sooner be."
Lae'zel,"Your father, you mean?"
Lae'zel,I... I will hear no more of it.
Lae'zel,I let my guard down. It won't happen again.
Lae'zel,"When the blade has cut clean through, it is too late for sorries."
Lae'zel,Is your mind so fragile that you couldn't say 'no'? Was our bond so weak that a single spark could break it?
Lae'zel,She was a hell of a fighter - she'll be fine.
Lae'zel,A travesty to have lost such a noble fighter
Lae'zel,It's been a while... how have you been?
Lae'zel,No. I will not kill Orpheus for you.
Lae'zel,Wait is that Tav?
Lae'zel,His death was honourable. And yet - I mourn him still.
Lae'zel,Poor/brave/selfless/whatever this companion would say about Gale. We owe him a debt we'll never be able to repay.
Lae'zel,Don't you dare subject me to petty lies.
Lae'zel,Tell me. Did her skin taste as good as mine? Did her tongue make you shiver?
Lae'zel,"Mm. Just keep it quiet, hear?"
Lae'zel,"Let her stay if you want. But if that bard breaks out in song, I'm not having it."
Lae'zel,Ghaik!
Lae'zel,I do not share. That is not drama - that is pride. You might want to find some of your own.
Lae'zel,Only allies. Nothing more.
Lae'zel,To bind oneself to another forever seems a fool's vow.
Lae'zel,I will meet you in Baldur's Gate. Do not make me regret it.
Lae'zel,"I served Vlaakith the whole of my life. Learned her words, fought her battles. Yet your words carry truth."
Lae'zel,Yes. Yes! I am Vlaakith's will!
Lae'zel,No. I don't believe it.
Lae'zel,"Leave the corpses be, let the maggots feast. Our betrayers deserve no better."
Lae'zel,Baldur's Gate's sewer system could use a few... improvements.
Lae'zel,It isn't the smell that bothers me - it's the inefficiency. An entire underground wasted on waste that could simply be teleported to Wildspace.
Lae'zel,"I'm afraid I can't return the sentiment - but I know of some githyanki who would find him quite... appealing. Mouth-watering, in fact."
Lae'zel,"The Blade of Frontiers, hm? Do you always need to be the centre of attention?"
Lae'zel,"Invite her in, cast her out. I see no difference either way."
Lae'zel,"If you wish to be rid of your devil, Wyll, we should just kill her and be done with it."
Lae'zel,"Wyll, you are a man of great vigour. Why have you not sought a mate any of these nights we have camped?"
Lae'zel,"Does your species release airborne pheromones upon beginning the courtship dance, Wyll?"
Lae'zel,I've heard thus is the way with certain birds of paradise and prey. The chemical induces lowered inhibitions between the pair.
Lae'zel,Indubitably.
Lae'zel,This is... nice. Yes. I think that's the right word for it.
Lae'zel,Old friend.
Lae'zel,I thought slaying Vlaakith's hunters in the cliffs of Sword's Teeth might be the month's pinnacle.
Lae'zel,"But I was wrong. Being right here, with you, is an infinitely greater pleasure."
Lae'zel,I will not entertain madness. Only in Vlaakith's might am I free!
Lae'zel,I smell danger on the wind. Keep your weapons ready.
Lae'zel,Discount my warning at your peril.
Lae'zel,No. I have not cast off my chains only to be rebound.
Lae'zel,"I've not heard of these 'Flaming Fist'. Enlighten me, Wyll."
Lae'zel,"If Mizora lets you off her leash, that is."
Lae'zel,The enforcers of order - unmistakable in their vigilant bearing. So it goes across all the planes and their peoples.
Lae'zel,"Look out for me two months from now. I'll return to your arms, as surely as K'liir will forever circle the Sun."
Lae'zel,"I understand. I need you, love - but they need you even more."
Lae'zel,To think there was a time when we were at each others' throats.
Lae'zel,I won't be far. Not tonight. Not ever.
Lae'zel,"We'll devise a plan of attack soon enough. For now, why don't you go and mingle? That's the word, right? 'Mingle?'"
Lae'zel,"My love, my Shadowheart. To think there was a time when we were at each others' throats."
Lae'zel,I need you - but the city needs you more.
Lae'zel,I'll set off on my own tomorrow.
Lae'zel,Understood. A Grand Duke's duties extend beyond gutting githyanki assassins.
Lae'zel,I thought watching you slay Vlaakith's hunters in the cliffs of Sword's Teeth might be the month's pinnacle.
Lae'zel,I slayed Vlaakith's hunters in the cliffs of Sword's Teeth and the wetlands of Lizard Marsh.
Lae'zel,"The Blade of Frontiers, my old friend."
Lae'zel,"The Blade of Avernus, old friend."
Lae'zel,"Duke Wyll Ravengard, old friend."
Lae'zel,Old friend. So different from when we first met.
Lae'zel,I have my dignity. What I do not have is patience for your disloyalty.
Lae'zel,We have spilled one another's blood. We have spent blows until utter exhaustion.
Lae'zel,The one who took Orpheus from me. The one who condemned the githyanki people to slavery.
Lae'zel,"My own friend, the Hellswalker."
Lae'zel,"Go, mingle while you can. That's the word, right? 'Mingle?'"
Lae'zel,Disappointing. But I won't argue - my heart has no room for new grudges.
Lae'zel,There is plenty of time yet for slicing scalps and tasting blood.
Lae'zel,I've got wind of a githyanki outpost hidden deep in Chult. The last of Vlaakith's Sword Coast strongholds.
Lae'zel,"Of course, there are ways you might make amends."
Lae'zel,"- but truth is, I'm glad to see you. I wouldn't even deny it with Vlaakith's vorpal blade at my neck. Though I'd rather it not come to that."
Lae'zel,Damned fool. The wretched cannot sway the divine!
Lae'zel,Just be sure to keep me on the menu.
Lae'zel,"Ah - your endless charms are exceeded only by your endless appetites, Astarion."
Lae'zel,"Now go, mingle while you can. That's the word, right? 'Mingle?'"
Lae'zel,"What a wonder he is. He will be a fine warrior, if he chooses. Or a poet, or an explorer, or a scholar."
Lae'zel,Of course. I have complete trust in our newest allies. Xan is in fine hands tonight.
Lae'zel,"Speak to me, Source of my Joy."
Lae'zel,A taste I will never grow tired of.
Lae'zel,You proved me a fool. I am forever grateful.
Lae'zel,"Love. Until I knew you, I thought the mere idea a joke. A weakness indulged only by lesser species."
Lae'zel,Fine. I'll hear what you have to say before I gut you.
Lae'zel,"If you so deign to speak with your lessers, that is."
Lae'zel,Of course. Mortals are meant to worship and obey. What other role might they possibly play in the life of a god?
Lae'zel,Looks like we owe Raphael a semi-friendly visit.<br>
Lae'zel,What say you?
Lae'zel,I say we sneak in under cover of night. We slit every last throat and you feed until your belly's full.
Lae'zel,"How about you help me raze it to the ground, put those godly powers to good use?"
Lae'zel,"Alas, I can only rest so long. I've got wind of a githyanki outpost hidden deep in Chult. The last of Vlaakith's Sword Coast strongholds."
Lae'zel,"Well. Why don't you go and mingle? That's the word, right? 'Mingle?'"
Lae'zel,So it has. I call him Xan. 'Freedom'.
Lae'zel,Your cronies tried to kill us. Why should I listen to you?
Lae'zel,"Tonight, he is safe among people I proudly call friends."
Lae'zel,"A tenday of good wine, good music - and the best company: yours."
Lae'zel,"Waukeentide is to start soon in Waterdeep, as I understand it. We are due a celebration - a gust of bright colours. "
Lae'zel,"Waukeentide is to start soon in Waterdeep, as I understand it. You are due a hometown celebration - a gust of bright colours among familiar streets."
Lae'zel,Right you are - not every night is for spilling blood. I shouldn't be so callous as to spoil the quiet pleasures of this one.
Lae'zel,"Let's not carried away, Wyll."
Lae'zel,True warriors among the city's Flaming Fist seem exceedingly rare. The worst are mere rats scurrying about their warren.
Lae'zel,"How incredible, for them to carry it back."
Lae'zel,"Eating, sleeping, and sex acts of all manner, of course."
Lae'zel,"'Mini-Lae'zel' wasn't so sheltered. On Crèche K'liir, very little is hidden behind doors."
Lae'zel,You always did have a great fire in your belly. I am glad to see you have kept it kindled.
Lae'zel,You always did have a great fire in your belly. I'm glad to be the one to keep it kindled.
Lae'zel,"Glorious Vlaakith. I am unclean. I exhort you, grant me guidance."
Lae'zel,Supreme Kith'rak. Has Vlaakith sent you to slay me with your own blade?
Lae'zel,"Of course you must. What good is a mortal to a god, if she dares not to offer fealty?"
Lae'zel,"I suppose to you, mortals are meant only to worship and obey. What other role might they possibly play in the life of a god?"
Lae'zel,Zhak vo'n'fynh duj.
Lae'zel,Kneel before Vlaakith. Promise to slay Orpheus.
Lae'zel,"I do not wish to spill blood here. Come daylight, we will find a place to end this."
Lae'zel,Tell me. What must I do to regain your trust?
Lae'zel,"Stand down, fool. This battle is not your concern."
Lae'zel,Ugh. Isn't there a human crèche she can join?
Lae'zel,Understood.
Lae'zel,It's better this way. Trust me.
Lae'zel,Only in Vlkaakith may we find light.
Lae'zel,Only in Vlkaakith may I find light.
Lae'zel,If only you knew how much went unsaid.
Lae'zel,Keep it coming. Give me all you've got!
Lae'zel,"You have stirred my soul, and more besides. But I belong to Vlaakith. I cannot be yours. You cannot be mine."
Lae'zel,"Everything's fine, trust me. Now come."
Lae'zel,I'll make it worth your while. I promise.
Lae'zel,Come.
Lae'zel,Then I'll go.
Lae'zel,Don't say a word. Just listen.
Lae'zel,The traitor Voss is dead. Let his heresy die with him.
Lae'zel,Shh. Let me speak.
Lae'zel,It's not that I want to. It's that I must.
Lae'zel,Bah - is it really so difficult? K'ha'ssji'trach'ash!
Lae'zel,Yes. Just like that!
Lae'zel,"Think you're clever, do you?"
Lae'zel,"The dawn was my torment. Rustling leaves, agony. I couldn't wait to escape this place. Now, I revel in it. I revel in you."
Lae'zel,This is nicely barbaric and vulgar.
Lae'zel,"You showed me the betweens and beyonds. Between war and peace, beyond passion and obsession."
Lae'zel,Most importantly - you showed me freedom.
Lae'zel,"There's more, but - but I don't know how to say it. I don't know what to call it. I just know whatever comes next, I want you near."
Lae'zel,"When all this is over, will you stay with me? For good?"
Lae'zel,"One step, then. Maybe even two - if I should be so lucky."
Lae'zel,"More. Wound me, scar me."
Lae'zel,"I know. I'm stubborn, I'm rude, I'm pushy. Maybe I always will be. But I'm also loyal and protective and ferocious."
Lae'zel,You have taken the whole of me. I could never accept just a piece of you in return.
Lae'zel,Literal - but not wrong. I see something else.
Lae'zel,"Trust me, my bones ache for battle too. But look closer - you might see something else."
Lae'zel,I can't deny that I feel for you. But you are a - a distraction. I belong to Vlaakith. I cannot be yours. You cannot be mine.
Lae'zel,I value you as a friend. As an ally. But my future lies only in the red and the black.
Lae'zel,Clever. But this isn't over.
Lae'zel,Best me. Prove your excellence.
Lae'zel,"And I've learned other ways, too - the ways of affection and devotion. First, you were my wound; now, you are its cure."
Lae'zel,Beauty.
Lae'zel,A parasite grips my mind. My own people hunt me. But I am gnawed by an even greater torment.
Lae'zel,A vampire among us? So be it.
Lae'zel,Truth. So tainted by death and deceit that I'd forgotten its taste.
Lae'zel,"My eyes were open, and I refused to see. My ears heard, and still I turned away. But I will be slave no more."
Lae'zel,I know my allegiance. It is to my Queen!
Lae'zel,Vlaakith is my path. Ascension is my fate!
Lae'zel,"You. I lend you my might, my very essence, and you thwart my will at every turn!"
Lae'zel,My queen calls. I am prepared to answer.
Lae'zel,Have you already forgotten? Did my own Queen not turn her back?
Lae'zel,No. I will not turn on my Queen!
Lae'zel,Yes. Yes! 'Beware the lies of false prophets.' So said the exalted Queen. And so I will heed!
Lae'zel,Yes. Yes! I will be pure. I will ascend. I will wield silver!
Lae'zel,"I see it - your great will, your great strength, a gift from Vlaakith herself."
Lae'zel,I am Gith's child. I bend to Vlaakith no longer.
Lae'zel,Then I turn to the True Heir.
Lae'zel,You'd even consider letting him stay? We must be rid of this menace.
Lae'zel,We fight. I test you in battle.
Lae'zel,Dance with me. Bleed with me. Bruise me so that you might possess me.
Lae'zel,No. I will be slave no longer!
Lae'zel,I am obsessed by the ground under your feet and the wind over your head. I see your face just before I sleep and after I wake.
Lae'zel,You know me.
Lae'zel,Orpheus. Impossible. The traitor is dead.
Lae'zel,"For his sake, he best not develop an appetite for githyanki."
Lae'zel,I ask myself: are you worthy?
Lae'zel,Don't be ridiculous.
Lae'zel,A fine sentiment. But I require more.
Lae'zel,You thrice-damned rotten bastard! You've been the greatest threat to our lives all this time!
Lae'zel,Has the tadpole wrecked your senses? He must be cast out immediately.
Lae'zel,I agree. Let us be rid of this menace.
Lae'zel,"'Fahra'. Vlaakith's Hand, her Eyes, her Voice."
Lae'zel,It was an honor serving my Queen.
Lae'zel,I couldn't do it. It's the only thing protecting me now.
Lae'zel,"I wish I could, but it's the only thing protecting me."
Lae'zel,Using Orpheus's power to our advantage is our best chance against the illithids.
Lae'zel,I will not hand over the artefact.
Lae'zel,I need it to fulfill my mission. Without it I cannot serve my Queen.
Lae'zel,Supreme Kith'rak. Have you come to slay me with your own silver?
Lae'zel,Speak. My ear is yours.
Lae'zel,I have tried! I went to the Creche!
Lae'zel,Your lust for blood is rare. Let us hope you know where to direct it.
Lae'zel,"Yes. And something else, too."
Lae'zel,I lived for the red of blood and the black of death. Now I see the colours between.
Lae'zel,Wrong me how?
Lae'zel,A vain notion. I am one of many and will not be a burden to my Queen.
Lae'zel,I know they do not. It is my responsibility to cleanse myself.
Lae'zel,"And my kin will understand my need for servants. They will help you, but only if I ask."
Lae'zel,Finally. Let us make for the helm - we've wasted enough time already.
Lae'zel,"If I can reach the crèche, my kin will provide - any failure will be mine alone."
Lae'zel,"'Thaniel', he said. Halsin's young target, yes?"
Lae'zel,"Killing is good - it culls the weak. But theft would be paid for painfully, a thousand times over."
Lae'zel,This ship is crashing. Do you intend to die for a stranger?
Lae'zel,"Good. Eyes up, and don't look back."
Lae'zel,We have no time for stragglers.
Lae'zel,Fool.
Lae'zel,Don't bother. You'll barely dent it.
Lae'zel,Now move. You are wasting time.
Lae'zel,Who am I? Your only chance of survival.
Lae'zel,Not now - we must go to the helm.
Lae'zel,It cannot be helped. Come.
Lae'zel,To the transponder.
Lae'zel,"You have done mischief enough with hairpins, if your tresses are an indication. The prisoners would be a hindrance."
Lae'zel,"I do not know your metaphor. But if you need help digging, I will find a shovel."
Lae'zel,I will hammer Orpheus free from his chains. And I will cleave him from brain to belly.
Lae'zel,"Ch'mar, zal'a Vlaakith!"
Lae'zel,I will take the key from Voss' contact in the city. And I will free the prince so I might cleave him from brain to belly.
Lae'zel,"O! queen, you've heard my cries. Now, I heed your sacred mission. "
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith gha'g shkath zai. Zai, zai, zai!"
Lae'zel,Orpheus will fall. And I will have my just rewards.
Lae'zel,Waste no time thinking about what won't come to pass.
Lae'zel,No. Why would I bury a weapon? Is it broken?
Lae'zel,"Let us bathe in our pride, then - but for just a moment. Pride turns to vanity if left too long fester."
Lae'zel,'Vlaakith's mercy is as rare as the disciple who earns it.'
Lae'zel,"It is done. My faith is acknowledged, my destiny set in slate."
Lae'zel,"Yes, do keep your wits, Shadowheart. Should a dagger suddenly slice your neck, we may never know who's to blame."
Lae'zel,"Admire it? As an overripe fruit ready for plucking, or a fattened calf awaiting the knife, perhaps."
Lae'zel,It would cause too much noise during my nighttime... exertions. I do not wish to alert foes of our location.
Lae'zel,"They were beneath me, at times. But also above me, And standing, at certain points."
Lae'zel,"If I choose to kill you, you will not even see it."
Lae'zel,"My queen, my eternal regent. Through your eternal wisdom, I will be legend!"
Lae'zel,Look at the sun. What do you see?
Lae'zel,Enough dawdling - move.
Lae'zel,Fool. To the transponder.
Lae'zel,Save your compliments. I won't accept them.
Lae'zel,I want something more.
Lae'zel,'You are mine.'
Lae'zel,Show me.
Lae'zel,Lay me.
Lae'zel,I won't beg.
Lae'zel,"Yet I cannot take of your flesh, of your body. I can withstand anything in the realms, but not the fire in you."
Lae'zel,Right answer.
Lae'zel,I cannot master you. I cannot even try.
Lae'zel,But I also didn't doubt me.
Lae'zel,It was. Your wounds are your proof.
Lae'zel,"You were stronger. I was steel, and you were silver."
Lae'zel,Get up. There's something you should see.
Lae'zel,I know it's early. But this couldn't wait.
Lae'zel,Watch.
Lae'zel,"I used to hate that sight. The glowing sky, the long shadows, the fading stars."
Lae'zel,I am made malleable by the flames in you. By the inferno of the Hells. But I cannot touch you. I can have no part of you - none!
Lae'zel,My body is ready.
Lae'zel,Say the words.
Lae'zel,Fool - where are you going?
Lae'zel,You have wasted enough time.
Lae'zel,No more features.
Lae'zel,To the helm - we must not delay.
Lae'zel,Do you wish to die? We cannot linger here.
Lae'zel,There is no time to tarry.
Lae'zel,I would expect so. It is the one path to our purification.
Lae'zel,Losiir. I see you've earned your robes.
Lae'zel,You are wasting time. To the helm. Hurry!
Lae'zel,"They're dead, Vlaakith be praised."
Lae'zel,You prove surprisingly adequate in battle.
Lae'zel,"We are nearing the helm. Once inside, do as I say."
Lae'zel,Kainyank.
Lae'zel,"If the True Soul wants to help, so be it. We're in no state to refuse."
Lae'zel,No more. I can't bear it.
Lae'zel,'I am yours.'
Lae'zel,Ignore the devil! We must take the transponder.
Lae'zel,Now - to the helm.
Lae'zel,Use the tadpole. Seek Vlaakith's mind through her psionic conveyance.
Lae'zel,"Say 'go', and I will go. And I will speak of this no longer."
Lae'zel,Enough. I've heard sweeter sounds from a dying vrock.<br>
Lae'zel,This artefact contains our people's future. I won't let you take it.
Lae'zel,"You cannot best me. You will die here, and your legacy will die with you."
Lae'zel,Stand down! It is on our queen's sacred order that I keep the Prism close.
Lae'zel,A lesson taught in flesh and bone this very night. Associate as you wish. Avert your eyes at your peril.
Lae'zel,Associate as you wish. Indulge yourself at your own peril.
Lae'zel,"A lesson you might have heeded, had your flesh not been weak."
Lae'zel,"'Turn your back not to your ally, lest you would see it pierced.' A githyanki dictum."
Lae'zel,"I'd give the artefact to you freely, but it isn't possible."
Lae'zel,"'Turn your back not to your ally, lest you would see it pierced.' So Vlaakith has taught us."
Lae'zel,If only you'd earned the right to lay at my side.
Lae'zel,A pity for us both you've turned your back on me so often.
Lae'zel,A pity for us you have promised your night to the drow.
Lae'zel,I've no doubt she will satisfy your tastes for endless conversation.
Lae'zel,A pity for us you have promised your night to the half-elf.
Lae'zel,I've no doubt he will satisfy your tastes for endless conversation.
Lae'zel,A pity for us you have promised your night to Gale.
Lae'zel,To think you might have known paradise.
Lae'zel,"Come morning, you will wonder."
Lae'zel,"The queen has entrusted me with the Prism. Interfere, and death will be her reward to you."
Lae'zel,This artefact contains the key to our freedom. It is not for the lich queen to take!
Lae'zel,"We can simply return in a few days, and take the box from the shell of her corpse."
Lae'zel,Why bother with chatter? Our cure is at the crèche.
Lae'zel,I can see your scars. The torment you felt... your mind and body at the mercy of another master...
Lae'zel,"Snuffed out in an instant. They will never feed and never be hunted. And never have a chance to hew their own paths. Was it worth it, Astarion?"
Lae'zel,"Come, Astarion. It's time to go."
Lae'zel,Return the Astral Prism to Vlaakith and regain her favour.
Lae'zel,Look for a way back into the Prism and ask the dream figure what she knows.
Lae'zel,"Strike me and die, a failed warrior forgotten by your people."
Lae'zel,Look for a way back into the Prism and ask the dream figure what he knows.
Lae'zel,Maybe there's no forge. Maybe we find a party of pit fiends or a hundred chain devils waiting for us. So what? We'll slice them into chunks like all the others.<br>
Lae'zel,Do what you do best: fight. Bleed your own people if they come for your head.
Lae'zel,Stand down! It is on our Queen's sacred order that I keep the Prism close.
Lae'zel,Stand down - I protect the Prism on our queen's behalf!
Lae'zel,"The queen has entrusted me with the Prism. Interfere, and death will be her only gift to you."
Lae'zel,Strike me and die - a failed warrior forgotten by our people.
Lae'zel,Orpheus lives. The empire will be his.
Lae'zel,Look for a way back into the Prism and ask the dream figure what they know. 
Lae'zel,No. This isn't the way!
Lae'zel,Mm - if only I might lay claim to my proper trophy.
Lae'zel,"Oh, but do enjoy yourself this night. I intend to, myself."
Lae'zel,"Another fortune yet stands before you. A warrior's flesh, rarely tasted."
Lae'zel,You know the fortune of my company.
Lae'zel,I mean to taste it.
Lae'zel,I smell their blood on you still. I smell your sweat.
Lae'zel,"Too bad for us both your bunk will be quite busy. Take all the pleasures you can, before dawn brings their end."
Lae'zel,I smell their blood on you still. I'd have liked to have tasted it.
Lae'zel,How torturous for us both that I'll never get a taste.
Lae'zel,Bah - think if you must. The chance will pass come light of day.
Lae'zel,A glorious reward for a glorious battle.
Lae'zel,Yet they could not match your nerve today. It was enough to drive me to madness.
Lae'zel,Mm. You have given in.
Lae'zel,"Soon. When you rest, I will come."
Lae'zel,"Celebrate now. Come dawn, we depart."
Lae'zel,We must not forget this night. True allies are few.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith. My queen be honoured.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith. The enslaver.
Lae'zel,I smell their blood on you still. I smell your moisture.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith demands of me no less.
Lae'zel,"When you lie down for the night, I will come."
Lae'zel,I will have to seek relief elsewhere.
Lae'zel,"Oh, but do enjoy yourself this night. I intend to, myself. Astarion looks particularly tempting."
Lae'zel,"You will wonder how my lips might have tasted, how my fingers on your skin might have felt."
Lae'zel,"But come morning, you will wonder."
Lae'zel,I will do no such thing - not when you have turned your back on me so often.
Lae'zel,"One day, fortune may favour you."
Lae'zel,"I will take pleasure when I wish, and from whom I wish."
Lae'zel,"I will take pleasure when I wish, and from whom I wish. Astarion looks particularly tempting tonight."
Lae'zel,A loathsome hurdle. Watching you burn lit a fire in me I could not quench alone.
Lae'zel,Perhaps not.
Lae'zel,A pity for us you have promised your body to Astarion.
Lae'zel,"There are, after all, other spreads before me."
Lae'zel,I will not go long without pleasure.
Lae'zel,"There are, after all, other spreads before me. Astarion looks particularly tempting tonight."
Lae'zel,I respect your error.
Lae'zel,A night such as this calls for flesh to feast on. And I have chosen the sweetest.
Lae'zel,Sex.
Lae'zel,I hope for your sake he doesn't come too near your neck.
Lae'zel,Inoffensive enough.<br>
Lae'zel,"A herd of vampire spawn, unleashed on the Sword Coast. What could go wrong?"
Lae'zel,"Astarion - I've known this craving too. Craving for power, for control. But I fear your lust verges on madness.<br>"
Lae'zel,Then a warrior's death it is. Come. I will stay by your side until the very last moment - source of my bruises.
Lae'zel,Your sense is intact. Good. Let us go - before it's too late.
Lae'zel,It is Zariel who should tremble - not us.
Lae'zel,I would relish the opportunity to test my mettle upon the devils of Avernus.
Lae'zel,You will not die today.
Lae'zel,You are the saviour of the Sword Coast. You are the murderer of death itself. You are the source of my joy. 
Lae'zel,"Of course I am. You indulged an obsession - you tasted me, tested me, and had your fill."
Lae'zel,"First, you inflict my wounds. Then with burning breath, you close them. I have lost the thread between pain and pleasure."
Lae'zel,"As I expected. You indulged an obsession - you tasted me, tested me, and had your fill."
Lae'zel,"Instead, you tasted me, tested me - and turned away when you'd had your fill."
Lae'zel,"I might have said yes, if you'd further indulged our obsessions."
Lae'zel,My life will be coloured by blood-red and death-black. I must prepare for the battles to come.
Lae'zel,"An unforgiveable slight, to me - and to our bond."
Lae'zel,"You are the source of my wounds. I will forever remember, and forever bleed."
Lae'zel,This is good-bye. Not because I don't care for you - but because I do.
Lae'zel,"You let perish the Prince of the Comet, the True Heir of my people."
Lae'zel,"You inflicted my wounds, and I inflicted yours. Some will stop hurting. But all of them will leave lasting marks."
Lae'zel,"You let perish the Prince of the Comet, the True Heir of our people."
Lae'zel,Orpheus is dead - yet Vlaakith still marks me as traitor and prey.
Lae'zel,The Undying Queen's knights will chase me across Faerûn 'til I draw my final breath.
Lae'zel,That is how you earn my trust. Not how you earn my flesh and spirit.
Lae'zel,"I've seen markings like these. Ancient githyanki inscriptions. Whatever this box, it's significant."
Lae'zel,Those runes - this object must hold great power. It will not yield to our hands alone.
Lae'zel,"By Vlaakith - we may not forsake it, nor it us."
Lae'zel,A parasite grips my mind. The shadows curse me. But I am gnawed by an even greater torment.
Lae'zel,So was I. But my blood runs too hot.
Lae'zel,"By Vlaakith, what magic is this?"
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith's turned her back to me, and I to her. I am forever marked."
Lae'zel,"By the planes, it is bound to us. A grave portent - or perhaps an encouraging one."
Lae'zel,There's no telling - but your people have turned on you. Vlaakith is afraid of being found out.
Lae'zel,It resembles the slate from Crèche Y'llek. I see similar patterns among the glyphs.
Lae'zel,Ah - another chapter of the Orpheus tale.
Lae'zel,"'The Prince of the Comet, Part One.'"
Lae'zel,"'Gith travelled to the Hells to broker help for her people, her cause. Vlaakith would have you believe Mother Gith proclaimed her our queen.'"
Lae'zel,'Lies! Gith made no such proclamation. Vlaakith seized the empire against the Mother's wishes.'
Lae'zel,"'But Gith had nurtured a son. Orpheus, Prince of the Comet, the True Heir! He knew Vlaakith's treachery.'"
Lae'zel,This secret is not yours to know. You will return the Astral Prism to Vlaakith and regain her favour.
Lae'zel,"Snuffed out in an instant, but to whose satisfaction? They will never feed and never be hunted. And never have a chance to hew their own paths."
Lae'zel,Orpheus has fallen. My life will be coloured by blood-red and death-black. I must prepare for the battles to come.
Lae'zel,Just - give me time to get used to the tentacles. And the head. But mostly the tentacles.
Lae'zel,"I abandoned my prince for you - and for a path of our making, away from the Astral."
Lae'zel,But that was the past. I must turn my attention to future days.
Lae'zel,And I see the source of my bruises. The one who earned my obsession and became my possession.
Lae'zel,Now I must turn my thoughts to future days.
Lae'zel,It's not your form that appals me. It's your contempt.
Lae'zel,"But I also see the wretch who made me betray Orpheus, son of Gith, prince of the githyanki."
Lae'zel,- and the one with whom I'd spend my future days.
Lae'zel,"And yet I breathe all the more free. Little is lost, so much is gained."
Lae'zel,I see the generous spirit who sacrificed everything so my people could be free.
Lae'zel,I see the conqueror who defeated the Netherbrain and ended its Grand Design.
Lae'zel,An illithid stands before me. My eyes show me a horror; my heart sees something more.
Lae'zel,"If the figure holds the power to resist illithid control, you must return it to Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,This figure is protecting you from the Absolute. He is an ally - and worth hearing out.
Lae'zel,This figure is protecting you from the Absolute. She is an ally - and worth hearing out.
Lae'zel,This figure is protecting you from the Absolute. They are an ally - and worth hearing out.
Lae'zel,Your people have turned on you. There must be truth in the figure's words.
Lae'zel,I see the generous spirit who sacrificed everything so our people could be free.
Lae'zel,"Rain death on your enemies and blood-wine on our flesh, and there is every chance."
Lae'zel,"By any account, I should have slit you open from scalp to stomach and watched you drain.<br>"
Lae'zel,Last night will be forever branded into my memory -
Lae'zel,"Quite simply: yes. I was stained by Vlaakith's lies. Without you, I'd never have been cleansed of them."
Lae'zel,My life will be coloured by blood-red and death-black. I face many battles to come. And I would ask you to join me.
Lae'zel,Good-bye. My first love and my last.
Lae'zel,"So strong is the bond's breaking, that it now shakes in turmoil."
Lae'zel,"So strong was our bond, the Astral Sea rippled in concord."
Lae'zel,"A thousand wounds inflicted, and you couldn't resist opening this last one."
Lae'zel,"Bah - what does it matter? You implored me to stay with you, only to reject me."
Lae'zel,"You made me betray Orpheus, son of Gith, prince of the githyanki."
Lae'zel,Back to bed. I have more tricks to show you...
Lae'zel,Come. Let's make this day count - and all the ones to follow.
Lae'zel,"Our days will be many, our bond ever stronger, as long as we hew together."
Lae'zel,We will not be their prey. They will be ours!
Lae'zel,"Yes. A bond so tight, Vlaakith would unleash the Astral Sea's fury if she every tried to break it."
Lae'zel,Our lives will be coloured by blood-red and death-black. Are you ready for the battles to come?
Lae'zel,I am forever marked by Vlaakith. The Undying Queen's knights will chase me across Faerûn 'til I draw my final breath.
Lae'zel,- but now I must think of future days.
Lae'zel,Hells - talk of battle's set my heart beating all over again. 
Lae'zel,So maybe we find a party of pit fiends or a hundred chain devils waiting for us. We'll slice them into chunks like all the others.
Lae'zel,As do I. Sometimes the acts are not dissimilar.
Lae'zel,"My story is yours now, Karlach. It may never be written in the githyanki slates, but it will be legendary all the same. No matter how it ends."
Lae'zel,I smell only fear - the fear of cowards lying in wait for an ambush.
Lae'zel,Stop.
Lae'zel,"My queen will see the truth and know this was the way forward. She will greet me in Tu'narath as the Comet's destroyer, the prince's ruin."
Lae'zel,NO! 
Lae'zel,We carry the means of the prince's release - and his death. This cannot be the way!
Lae'zel,I figured this abominable alliance at an end. But I fear we may have no choice.
Lae'zel,There is another path. We yet hold the Hammer. We might still free Orpheus and strike him down!
Lae'zel,Before you decide - let us speak.
Lae'zel,"Before you decide, let us speak of Orpheus - alone."
Lae'zel,"Has everyone's brains leaked from their skulls? We took the Orphic Hammer for a reason. 'Think', indeed."
Lae'zel,Finally - a modicum of rational thought.
Lae'zel,"Has the tadpole finally devoured what was left of your rational thought? We retrieved the Hammer, only for it to come to naught?"
Lae'zel,"Control yourself, Wyll. I understand bloodthirst. But this is no time to quench it."
Lae'zel,"I suggest we take a moment to rest, recuperate, and drink the nectars of victory."
Lae'zel,"And you, Gale? What are your next steps?"
Lae'zel,"I do not take days off. I'd even forego sleep, if such a thing were feasible. The one advantage an elf holds over a githyanki."
Lae'zel,I thought you my true kin. But you would keep your own people chained to their damnable queen!
Lae'zel,To think I ever hoped for more from you... 
Lae'zel,You have damned our people for eternity. 
Lae'zel,"The further we sink into shadow, the further the crèche. We must take to my people. They are our only means of cleansing."
Lae'zel,"Pursue this path further, and I will go alone if I have to."
Lae'zel,A map to the crèche - as if I'd forgotten my duty.
Lae'zel,A map to a githyanki crèche. Our cure is nestled in the mountains.
Lae'zel,A map to a githyanki crèche. My cure is nestled in the mountains.
Lae'zel,Is the worm gnawing at your grey matter? We must find a crèche and be purified.
Lae'zel,Fate has a way of pulling us along with or without our approval.
Lae'zel,"Wield a god's power, and expect the full weight of opposing gods' wrath. I expect Mystra will be the first you contend with."
Lae'zel,Kill him and take his stone. The Grand Design cannot come to pass.
Lae'zel,"I will take the Orphic Hammer from Raphael's lair. The prince will be freed, so I might cleave him from brain to belly."
Lae'zel,We will destroy the Netherbrain - and I will ascend to my queen's side!
Lae'zel,"We hold the Hammer in hand, and you stood against me. Still - I see a path to ascension."
Lae'zel,"You would keep my people chained to their damnable queen. I should've trusted my gut, driven a blade through your throat at first chance."
Lae'zel,Only a newborn could be so naive.
Lae'zel,Do not speak his name!
Lae'zel,You have damned my people for eternity.
Lae'zel,Do not stand against me.
Lae'zel,Only a cruel god would refuse you. May Mystra's wisdom prevail over her enmity.
Lae'zel,Gale - this is no time for sentimental gawking.
Lae'zel,Speak your troubles - or relinquish them.
Lae'zel,The Lord of Murder calls you. You know what your answer must be.
Lae'zel,We hold the means to free the Prince of the Comet. How is this even a debate?
Lae'zel,"The traitor prince, dead at last - my queen's mission fulfilled..."
Lae'zel,No. I - I trusted you...
Lae'zel,"There's no greater pleasure than battle. You face your enemy and conquer them, blade to blade, spell to spell."
Lae'zel,But to take a life unawares is no more to be celebrated than plunging a dagger into a trapped rat.
Lae'zel,Perhaps it should. All I see are carousing fools.
Lae'zel,Only Bane's Chosen remains. Let us see he meets the same fate.
Lae'zel,"I know, Astarion. You prefer blood."
Lae'zel,"Fun? I fight to win, not to make spectacles."
Lae'zel,Only if my people extract them. The only other cure is the blade.
Lae'zel,Indeed. All the best weapons have already been scavenged.
Lae'zel,"I am perfectly charming, I'll have you know. On Crèche K'liir, I was known for my dazzling smile and charisma."
Lae'zel,"A good hunting ground, then?"
Lae'zel,"If you cease your frivolous ways, keep your mouth closed, and learn to obey, perhaps we can attempt it."
Lae'zel,'Pet' names? As if we were domesticated animals?
Lae'zel,"I know that, too. It just wasn't funny."
Lae'zel,"The further we sink into shadow, the further the crèche. We must take to our people. They are our only means of cleansing."
Lae'zel,"To Gortash, then. I'm sure his enthusiasm will be... boundless."
Lae'zel,Then let us hope your intentions remain as they are and do not undergo any further corruption. 
Lae'zel,"Gale will be but one god among many - doomed to squabble, to battle, to vie for control and power. And we will be the pieces they play with."
Lae'zel,But somehow I do not think Mystra will allow it to happen so readily. 
Lae'zel,"He chose his fate. Now, let us make the most of ours."
Lae'zel,What shall we do next?
Lae'zel,Revelry? A grand notion - we've earned the right to an indulgence or two.
Lae'zel,But I leave the final call to our esteemed leader.
Lae'zel,I have fought many great battles by your side - I long for many more. I hope you reconsider. 
Lae'zel,We honour the fallen. Starting with Gale. 
Lae'zel,"Amn? A keen idea - I was taught its Cloud Peaks are infested with monsters of all sorts. But first, fresh meat and a hot fire."
Lae'zel,"Now - all of Toril, spread before me. A million marks to make, a million battles to fight. "
Lae'zel,"Astarion - the sun's already begun to take its toll on you. Truly, I am sorry."
Lae'zel,That's the last of Astarion the sun will ever see. May he fare well in the dark.
Lae'zel,"I much prefer bloodletting to bricklaying. Hunt prey with me by night, and I will build with you by day."
Lae'zel,The Underdark has its violent charms. I might just pay you a visit once you're settled.
Lae'zel,"Far from the fate you deserve for the sacrifices you have made, but... I understand."
Lae'zel,"Fine. But do not let your guard down, even for a moment. Any hunter worth their blade seeks an illithid head as a trophy."
Lae'zel,"I may not belong to this land, but now, it belongs to me."
Lae'zel,"And if I must do so alone, so be it."
Lae'zel,"The further I sink into shadow, the further the crèche. I must go there, and quickly. It is my only means of cleansing."
Lae'zel,A map to the crèche - as if I'd forgotten my duty. 
Lae'zel,"It was my Queen's decree that he should die, and I intend to honour it. "
Lae'zel,It is done. A fitting death for a traitor. 
Lae'zel,"But you have chosen a path for yourself, and it does not lead to the Astral Plane."
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith will fall, and we will plant a seed. From that seed, githyanki freedom will blossom."
Lae'zel,"You understand, then. We will never be free while our people are still bound by Vlaakith's chains."
Lae'zel,"Duty... All my life, I've travelled in its slipstream, not once questioning its path. In its service, I came here. And now, in its service, I leave. "
Lae'zel,"I will carry your hope, Prince Orpheus, and I will carry your burden. But to that burden I must add my own - the loss of those I leave behind. "
Lae'zel,"Though I may call you ally, I do not need your blessing to fulfil my duty."
Lae'zel,It will be done. I will never be free while my people are still bound by Vlaakith's chains.
Lae'zel,"Yes, I will stay."
Lae'zel,"Mother Gith battled for liberty - but it was only here, with you, that I learned what it meant to be free."
Lae'zel,Yes - I will stay. My destiny is for neither Vlaakith nor Orpheus to decree. It is mine.
Lae'zel,"I have already chosen a way - the way of Orpheus. Vlaakith will fall, and I will plant a seed. From that seed, githyanki freedom will blossom."
Lae'zel,"Then you will come with me, and we will destroy the lich queen together."
Lae'zel,Quulos! Quuthos!
Lae'zel,Quulos!
Lae'zel,"Mother Gith battled for liberty - but it was only here that I learned what it meant to be adored, to be free."
Lae'zel,To the skies!
Lae'zel,"You made a promise to me when we freed him, and I intend to hold you to it, as I hold myself bound to my Queen. "
Lae'zel,It is not a matter of mind. It is a matter of faith - and I have been put to the test.
Lae'zel,I don't understand. The histories claim the prince was burned to ash in the skies.
Lae'zel,"Traitor. By the sacred silver, I'll make this prison your grave."
Lae'zel,"Orpheus - son of Gith, heir of All Skies. We do not come to slay you; we come to restore you."
Lae'zel,"Let us make camp, before the sun yields to the stars."
Lae'zel,"Out of here, quickly. We'll speak after."
Lae'zel,Forward. Kill who you must to survive  - even githyanki.
Lae'zel,The ravings of a lunatic. Strike her down.
Lae'zel,Trust me. You'll know when I'm ready to discuss it.
Lae'zel,Hm. I dislike owls. Their hyper-mobile necks are quite disconcerting.
Lae'zel,"Continue as you have, Karlach, and you will achieve the same."
Lae'zel,And I. This environ seems worthy of a githyanki warrior's estimation.
Lae'zel,Just a mirage. There's not a spot in sight that the gloom hasn't touched.
Lae'zel,"Even in this dark hour, there are some things to take heart in."
Lae'zel,A momentary spasm of the jaw. But perhaps there is cause.
Lae'zel,It is the sheen of the soldier's sweat on my brow.
Lae'zel,The under-harnesses are often used for strapping oneself onto a red dragon.
Lae'zel,It's just a bridge. Is it really worth all that ire?
Lae'zel,"Honey muffin, sweetie pie - Astarion, do you see all your lovers as food?"
Lae'zel,Yes. It is much more... lively... than the githyanki slates led me to believe.
Lae'zel,As noble in death as he was in life. His sacrifice will not be forgotten. 
Lae'zel,"The world looms before me - never has it felt so vast, and so empty. But at least it will be a world in which there is no Grand Design. "
Lae'zel,You... my ally... my peer... 
Lae'zel,"It will be a restless life, while the false queen reigns over our people. But a life, nonetheless - and a free one. "
Lae'zel,"It will be a restless life, while the false queen reigns over my people. But a life, nonetheless - and a free one. "
Lae'zel,"We fought well together. I will gladly fight with you again. If not the Astral Seas, then here, and wherever else we go. "
Lae'zel,For you? 
Lae'zel,It was under your watch that my Prince was slaughtered.
Lae'zel,I will not forget you.
Lae'zel,"You had the means to free Orpheus, but you chose not to. "
Lae'zel,"It is true you helped me end the Grand Design. But the path you chose has cost our people greatly. I will thank you, but I will not stay for you. "
Lae'zel,"It is true you helped me end the Grand Design. But the path you chose has cost my people greatly. I will thank you, but I will not stay for you. "
Lae'zel,I have crossed blades with countless warriors among the Tears of Selûne. But none so resilient as you.
Lae'zel,Only mild offence intended. You did us a great service - and I'm grateful for it.
Lae'zel,"Only mild offence intended, of course. You did the unthinkable - and I'm grateful for it."
Lae'zel,You faced impossible choices. You made the right one. Few would have the nerve.
Lae'zel,Have you ever known me to be sensitive?
Lae'zel,I watched you consume his mind. 
Lae'zel,A fitting death for a traitor.
Lae'zel,"I will remember the fights we fought together, but my next fights will be without you."
Lae'zel,"You helped our people end the Grand Design - for this, I will remember you. But I will not forget what you have cost us."
Lae'zel,"Save your thanks, traitor. They are hardly worth the breath you waste to speak them. "
Lae'zel,"You dare speak ill of my Queen? I will end you, Orpheus. "
Lae'zel,Orpheus. I am ready.
Lae'zel,"Until recently, I'd never felt the regret of an unwanted farewell. And now, I feel it double."
Lae'zel,"I say farewell to a lover. And I say farewell to you, a staunch ally and... friend."
Lae'zel,Orpheus - I'll remain here. My destiny is for neither you nor Vlaakith to set. It is mine alone.
Lae'zel,"I have already chosen a way - the way of Orpheus. Vlaakith will fall, and we will plant a seed. From that seed, githyanki freedom will blossom."
Lae'zel,"You helped my people end the Grand Design - for this, I will remember you. But I will not forget what you have cost us."
Lae'zel,"You are right. My choice, my life. I will know true liberation."
Lae'zel,Then I must go with the Prince. I will never be free while my people are still bound by Vlaakith's chains.
Lae'zel,I will be hunted by her Inquisition to the ends of the world. 
Lae'zel,I must leave. I have nothing more to gain by being here. 
Lae'zel,"No, I will not hesitate - this is my home. My destiny is for neither Vlaakith nor Orpheus to decree. It is mine."
Lae'zel,We've shared so much together. I wish...<br>
Lae'zel,"Perhaps - perhaps yes. Without them, I wouldn't have known warmth, only ice and fire."
Lae'zel,Perhaps there is a future here... 
Lae'zel,Mother Gith battled for liberty - but it was only here that I learned what it meant to be free.
Lae'zel,"Control him? Bah - the traitor must be ripped apart, brain to belly!"
Lae'zel,"You say you have had many lovers, Astarion. If that is true, where are they now?"
Lae'zel,A triumph most deserved. Well done.
Lae'zel,"Hardly. It is said that the Astral Plane is threaded with light and silver, life-giving and wondrous in all directions."
Lae'zel,I've never set eyes on it. But I promise it is nothing like this dismal abyss.
Lae'zel,"Go, rest. But do not consider this matter settled."
Lae'zel,Unfortunate. I thought you may have some honour.
Lae'zel,Keep it. Do what you will with it.
Lae'zel,"Hm. A creation of my people, though I cannot decipher writing this ancient."
Lae'zel,"Your contraband does not concern me, but it may concern my kin. Assume you are being hunted."
Lae'zel,"In time, I will slay the occupant of that artefact. You'd be foolish indeed to intervene."
Lae'zel,"In time, I will free the occupant of that artefact. You'd be foolish indeed to intervene."
Lae'zel,A moment.
Lae'zel,"I am content. Go, rest. Dawn breaks all too soon."
Lae'zel,"It is for other gith to hunt and punish you. And they will, knowing my kin."
Lae'zel,"But make no mistake - I will slay the Prism's occupant, as Vlaakith's commanded. Perhaps your mission can still be fulfilled... but it will not come at the cost of mine."
Lae'zel,"But I will attend to the Prism's occupant, in time. Perhaps your mission can still be fulfilled... but it will not come at the cost of mine."
Lae'zel,The artefact is closed to me. But its protection is an advantage - as is having a skilful cleric at my side.
Lae'zel,Nothing like this dismal abyss.
Lae'zel,"Hardly. The Astral Plane is threaded with light and silver, life-giving and wondrous in all directions."
Lae'zel,"Our goal is clear, is it not? We defeat the remaining Chosen and the elder brain they control."
Lae'zel,I doubt I am the first githyanki to... to feel this way. But few would ever declare it.
Lae'zel,Surrender? A disgusting notion.
Lae'zel,"Then we will ascend to the Astral Plane together. Now focus your mind, hear my words. I will speak the Rite."
Lae'zel,"The past is done, and we face the future. Apart, we can survive. Together we can thrive."
Lae'zel,"Our way forward is open, true. "
Lae'zel,Githyanki lay their eggs on other planes. They cannot mature in the Astral.
Lae'zel,I will only be welcomed once I obtain a mind flayer's head.
Lae'zel,"Imagine the glorious din of it all - the streaming banners, the charging knights, the piles of severed limbs and heads."
Lae'zel,"The queen's decision is made, and our fates are open. Gnash your teeth, shake your head, grunt all you want. "
Lae'zel,I find it surprisingly similar to Queen Vlaakith's aesthetic.
Lae'zel,- which will make the pleasure of overcoming them all the more potent.
Lae'zel,"This is why I appreciate a sharp blade to a ball of fire or a bolt of lightning. The Weave is inconsistent, unruly."
Lae'zel,A githyanki warrior hardly needs to be told that.
Lae'zel,"We are to use and misuse each civilisation in the stars, in every way we know. I do not conquer by blade alone, Gale."
Lae'zel,I did not grant you permission to gaze upon my midriff.
Lae'zel,"Love. Is that this feeling in me, then? This ... passion to peel every layer of one's heart to see what light and shadows lurk there?"
Lae'zel,"Githyanki have playmates. Thrill-partners. But I'd never heard anyone profess love, nor read of it in our slates."
Lae'zel,The obstacles ahead of us promise to be higher still -
Lae'zel,I hope I can count you in that number.
Lae'zel,A warrior never depends on luck - she depends on skill. And maybe a few good allies to keep her honest.
Lae'zel,Simply vexed. Anger would be impractical.
Lae'zel,"Perhaps, once it's recovered from the Netherbrain's scourge. I could find allies here, at very least."
Lae'zel,"A red dragon, to carry me to Tu'narath. The queen's covenant is fulfilled!"
Lae'zel,"Silence, now. I will speak the Rite."
Lae'zel,"You are an honourable ally. I thought I would carry you. In truth, you oft carried me. I won't forget it."
Lae'zel,My purpose was ordained before I hatched. Vlaakith is the wind that bears me and the fire that warms me.
Lae'zel,"Let them. Now, I hunt prey on my own terms and spill blood of my choosing. I need not be ascended - for I am born anew."
Lae'zel,"I've suffered so many bruises, bore so many blows, all to earn Vlaakith's favour."
Lae'zel,You have something precious to my kin - an heirloom. I will have it back.
Lae'zel,We have thwarted the Grand Design. My loyalty is beyond question.
Lae'zel,"We have thwarted the Grand Design, and I have slain the traitor prince. My loyalty is beyond question. "
Lae'zel,"Bah - you would deny Vlaakith's gift? Very well - while you fumble about on this rock, I will raise a silver sword in my queen's honour!"
Lae'zel,Come. The dragons will know the way.
Lae'zel,"Red dragons, to carry us to Tu'narath. The queen's covenant is fulfilled!"
Lae'zel,"So you have. Now focus your mind, hear my words. I will speak the Rite."
Lae'zel,"I've heard the same said of bears - the kind you take the shape of. They hoard, gorge, and hibernate through hard times."
Lae'zel,"Remove yourself, if you are so easily offended. This is not your concern."
Lae'zel,Silence now. I will speak the Rite of Ascension.
Lae'zel,"You would have me surrender, kin? A disgusting notion."
Lae'zel,I am merely curious about my travelling companion.
Lae'zel,"I will have an explanation from you, or I will have your head."
Lae'zel,"It's done. The Netherbrain is defeated - along with the Grand Design, praise Mother Gith."
Lae'zel,"I should feel relieved, yet my blood still simmers..."
Lae'zel,"It's done. The Netherbrain is defeated - along with the Grand Design, Vlaakith be praised."
Lae'zel,"Keep it, for now."
Lae'zel,"A relic of my people. An ancient one. Curious, that the one I'm to kill should be living inside it."
Lae'zel,"A relic of my people. An ancient one. Curious, that the one Voss wants me to free should live inside it."
Lae'zel,Show it to me.
Lae'zel,I know you have something precious to my kin. Explain yourself.
Lae'zel,Tell me what you are doing with it.
Lae'zel,The artefact you possess contains someone important - someone I may need to free.
Lae'zel,"Rest must wait, Shadowheart."
Lae'zel,"If you explain yourself, perhaps I will allow you to keep the heirloom."
Lae'zel,Use the parasite. Probe her thoughts.
Lae'zel,Let the matter drop for now.
Lae'zel,I do not believe you.
Lae'zel,"If that is true, you will have no qualms with showing it to me."
Lae'zel,The artefact you possess contains someone important - someone my queen demands to be slain.
Lae'zel,"Let me up, and I'll show you."
Lae'zel,"Spare me the justifications, coward."
Lae'zel,You should have stayed out of this!
Lae'zel,The gith you took this from will hunt you down and kill you. Slowly.
Lae'zel,Indeed? I wouldn't dare deny you your self-pleasures. But do clean up after yourself.
Lae'zel,"The relic is gith, but means nothing to me. You can do with it as you like."
Lae'zel,"I don't care about the relic, only the occupant inside it. Keep it with you."
Lae'zel,Vlaakith will not never stop hunting Prince Orpheus. Can he count on your support?
Lae'zel,What are you doing?! No! 
Lae'zel,I'm - not sure. She's been through quite the ordeal. Perhaps she's in camp...
Lae'zel,"You talk a great deal for a would-be murderer. Get on with it, if you dare try."
Lae'zel,Wait. Where's Karlach?
Lae'zel,Spare your indignity. Every word that spills from your mouth is worth less than the last.
Lae'zel,Consider the matter resolved then.
Lae'zel,My worst is for worthy foes. This will have to suffice.
Lae'zel,No others. Just you and me.
Lae'zel,"The bad blood must be purged. A duel, come first light."
Lae'zel,"I am certain you did. And now I shall find it in turn, on a dead half-elf."
Lae'zel,Do what you want. Don't expect me to applaud you when it's over.
Lae'zel,She returned to camp to rest - and to consider her fate. I fear Karlach is not long for this world.
Lae'zel,"The truth, now. Or vermin will feast on your carcass."
Lae'zel,That heirloom is as much my affair as it is yours.
Lae'zel,And yet here I stand. Concerned.
Lae'zel,Did you expect anything else? This is how your gods project power.
Lae'zel,"You've only just come to tolerate sun, and you're already nostalgic?"
Lae'zel,"If you're going to complain the whole way, by all means, return topside. You could use the colour."
Lae'zel,You carry a githyanki relic. I will have an explanation - or your head.
Lae'zel,She carries an heirloom of our people. She must explain herself.
Lae'zel,Lies upon more lies.
Lae'zel,"You must ask of the Orphic Hammer. Without it, the prince remains forever out of reach of my hungry weapon."
Lae'zel,Unimportant.
Lae'zel,"You must ask of the Orphic Hammer. Without it, the Prince of the Comet - and the githyanki people - remain forever chained."
Lae'zel,Lies. She carries an heirloom of my people. I must know why.
Lae'zel,I see you've met. Saves me the trouble of introductions.
Lae'zel,"Oh, but do keep calling her 'flower'. She'll love that."
Lae'zel,I know the gith heirloom you possess must be important to my kin. As I know they would not yield it willingly to you.
Lae'zel,"This matter concerns both of us, kin. Shadowheart has deceived us."
Lae'zel,We shall see. Now let us rest.
Lae'zel,A keepsake. Very well. Perhaps I was misinformed.
Lae'zel,"This place must house our contract with Raphael. If Hope points the way, we might take it - and shred it."
Lae'zel,"It must be said - because of you, I still breathe. Because of you, I still battle. I am not one to show gratitude, but - *ahem* - thank you."
Lae'zel,Perhaps this is so. Show me the heirloom.
Lae'zel,"For you, my queen: a thief's blood!"
Lae'zel,Indestructible? I'll reduce it to scrap metal before the day is done.
Lae'zel,A sorry tale. Barely worth interrogating you over. Show me the heirloom.
Lae'zel,"You have lied about the heirloom. I will have the truth, or I will have your life."
Lae'zel,Trade? Why stoop to barter when you have the power to take what you need?
Lae'zel,Indeed. There is no more impressive sight than a githyanki spelljammer with its astral sails unfurled.
Lae'zel,Sssh... do not move. Do not cry out. Or I will open your neck.
Lae'zel,You must. Or you will take your secrets to the grave.
Lae'zel,No matter. I can examine it for myself. Be still and this will be quick.
Lae'zel,"For now. Perhaps we can put our differences aside, out of mutual self-interest."
Lae'zel,Should that fail... at least I know you are a deep sleeper.
Lae'zel,"This suffices for now. Perhaps we can put our differences aside, out of mutual self-interest."
Lae'zel,I'm not going to regret this - I'm going to enjoy it.
Lae'zel,He succeeded. He destroyed the Netherbrain.
Lae'zel,But Gale... he's gone. 
Lae'zel,"He sacrificed his life for everyone. He may not have been a warrior, but he fought better than any of us. "
Lae'zel,"May your death be slow, and your agony great!"
Lae'zel,But there will come a time when I must attend to the artefact's occupant. You'd be a fool to intervene.
Lae'zel,"Ha! Very well, let us make this interesting."
Lae'zel,"His mind is forever lost. Come - he is no use to us, nor my queen."
Lae'zel,He is lost. A shame - he could have proved a great ally to Orpheus.
Lae'zel,"You're lucky I respect him. One more chance, then - tell me about the relic."
Lae'zel,Rest. Dawn breaks all too soon.
Lae'zel,You know the words. Now speak them.
Lae'zel,"You're lucky I respect her. One more chance, then - tell me about the relic."
Lae'zel,We take the Hammer and break Orpheus free. The traitor prince will perish by my hand.
Lae'zel,Be ready. A devil does not so readily give up his toys.
Lae'zel,What? This hammer can free Orpheus from his astral prison. Take it -
Lae'zel,"His mind is forever lost. Come - he is no use to us, nor our queen."
Lae'zel,Immediately.
Lae'zel,"You're lucky I respect them. One more chance, then - tell me about the relic."
Lae'zel,Purification is my mission - not your contraband. I am content for the time being.
Lae'zel,I'm merely being practical.
Lae'zel,"If only I might have remained there. Oh, to soar the skies above Tu'narath atop a red dragon..."
Lae'zel,"I don't hail from the Astral, Jaheira. My glimpse was as brief as yours, before we were cast back to the Material."
Lae'zel,"A githyanki raised in isolation. His blood boils like his kin's, but their ways are foreign."
Lae'zel,"A githyanki raised in isolation. His blood boils like Vlaakith's, but he knows nothing of the Protocols."
Lae'zel,"But beware. My kin undoubtedly hunt you. If caught, your death will be slow, exquisite."
Lae'zel,And then we carry on through the fires until we see blue sky again.
Lae'zel,"No! By the sacred silver, I'll make this prison your grave."
Lae'zel,Traitor prince. I am not intimidated by your blade.
Lae'zel,Can you feel it? The shadows gnaw at us. Do not take them for granted.
Lae'zel,"Do you feel it? The chill on your skin, in your lungs? This darkness is diseased."
Lae'zel,"The mastiffs still prowl. Quench those lights, lure them in - let's see if these creatures bleed."
Lae'zel,"Should his eyes betray even a slight hunger for gith blood, I will tear off his head before those fangs can scrape my flesh."
Lae'zel,"You show the bloodsucker more mercy than he deserves, Karlach."
Lae'zel,"Should Astarion's eyes betray even a slight hunger for gith blood, I will tear off his head before those fangs can scrape my flesh."
Lae'zel,"You show the bloodsucker far more compassion than he deserves, Karlach."
Lae'zel,Bah. She cannot be more pained than my own ears from that insufferable rhyming.
Lae'zel,"No, no, no. Does it really need to be said?<br>"
Lae'zel,An astral projection. We should take this one seriously - she's clever by half.
Lae'zel,Every moment a new danger. I may have underestimated this Faerûn.
Lae'zel,How I have longed for these familiar sounds and sights.
Lae'zel,What are you hiding?
Lae'zel,Why does anyone bother wearing swim-garments at all?
Lae'zel,I find the locals' fascination with 'the beach' is but a conspiracy for prudes to leer at each other unquestioned.
Lae'zel,"We must take this advantage. Githyanki perish in bloodbaths, not dreary curses."
Lae'zel,"A Moonlantern - it must be. And we must take it. Githyanki perish in bloodbaths, not dreary curses."
Lae'zel,Every step into the darkness leads us away from the crèche. Do not lose sight of our prize.
Lae'zel,Every step into the darkness leads us away from the crèche. Cleansing awaits - do not lose sight of our prize.
Lae'zel,Our gish sent word of the rebellion to their god-king Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith through the cosmos. He's agreed to parley.
Lae'zel,"Not all of us can play the weave like a lyre, Gale. I am the Comet, not a god."
Lae'zel,I do. I approach the gates of Shra'kt'lor even now.
Lae'zel,"Eternally trapped - a damned existence all its own. Never to be predator, never to be prey."
Lae'zel,My friend the Hellswalker.
Lae'zel,"Shadowheart, my friend."
Lae'zel,But to see Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard brings me even more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head.
Lae'zel,I ask not of Lady Shar - but of you and your paramour.
Lae'zel,But to see the Blade of Avernus brings me even more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head.
Lae'zel,But to see the Blade of Frontiers brings me even more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head.
Lae'zel,But to see your face... it brings me even more pleasure than taking a royal inquisitor's head.
Lae'zel,No. Pull away. Pull away!
Lae'zel,Keep your hands to yourself. Every last crevice of this tower could be... infected.
Lae'zel,What is wrong with you? Pull. Away!
Lae'zel,That voice. Like nothing I've ever heard...
Lae'zel,"Next time, stay your hand. The Absolute may be keen to speak, but I don't share Her enthusiasm."
Lae'zel,And to think you once held a blade to my throat. Not that I could blame you.
Lae'zel,"I heard a curious sound in night. What would you know about that, Shadowheart?"
Lae'zel,A rodent with an attitude. Not unlike a few githyanki I've known.
Lae'zel,A rat with delusions of grandeur. A bit like the gods themselves.
Lae'zel,I will wait. But know this: I am watching. If the sickness does not pass come dawn...
Lae'zel,I will be quick with my blade. First you. Then the others. Then myself.
Lae'zel,"I believe we're approaching the crèche. Once we're inside, let me do the talking."
Lae'zel,Your high regard for your own wits is no secret to anyone.
Lae'zel,Ready your weapons. This will not be resolved by wits alone.
Lae'zel,"I'm capable of restraint, just as you're capable of raw fury. I trust we'll find reason to exercise both here."
Lae'zel,"I know better than to indulge every craving, Shadowheart. But when the time is right, the Absolutists will feel the sting of my blade."
Lae'zel,Is that a problem?
Lae'zel,I itch to draw my weapon and gut every last one of these cultists.
Lae'zel,A tedious labour well suited to the undead.
Lae'zel,"Difficult terrain, cursed or not. Gith dragon-riders prefer flat land and open skies. "
Lae'zel,"Vicious, unrelenting. The sort of place I imagine you'd take to, Minthara."
Lae'zel,Karlach. Know you part us with honour. You are strong. You are ready.<br>
Lae'zel,"You may know it as Stardock. An asteroid, one of the Tears of Selûne. It's tunnels are home to all manner of creatures to hunt."
Lae'zel,"I have seen many a gruesome death, but even I can't fathom some of the horrors inflicted in this supposed 'House of Healing'."
Lae'zel,I know what I see - my mortal enemies. And I know what must be done about them.
Lae'zel,"Last Light's defenders - slaughtered, every last one."
Lae'zel,"Shra'kt'lor is the capital of the githzerai - an exiled people, once kin with mine until the madness of civil war ripped our one sky into two."
Lae'zel,"I've been watching you fight, Shadowheart. Your skills are improving."
Lae'zel,Bah - I cannot trust my own mind. So it seems I must trust yours.
Lae'zel,"A formidable woman like yourself does herself no favours in revealing herself to be so erratic, so... uncertain."
Lae'zel,You are debating allowing another into your heart.
Lae'zel,"Still. If you let me watch your technique, I might learn it from you."
Lae'zel,"How do you maintain such an elaborate plait, Shadowheart? The craftsmanship is impressive."
Lae'zel,"Your sour face is tiring, Shadowheart. By all means leave, if I am so distasteful."
Lae'zel,I don't pay compliments. I make observations.
Lae'zel,First you. Then myself.
Lae'zel,...I will end us all.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith gha'g shkath zai!
Lae'zel,The monster in you craves birth. I trust no one but me to deny it.
Lae'zel,This is no simple fever. This is ceremorphosis.
Lae'zel,Close your eyes. Submit.
Lae'zel,This is not exhaustion. This is ceremorphosis.
Lae'zel,"These rats paint a vivid picture, do they not?"
Lae'zel,"These rats paint a vivid picture, do they not? Volo might learn a thing or two."
Lae'zel,It feels as if a snake is slithering through every limb. My throat burns like flames erupted within.
Lae'zel,Take it. One motion. Across the neck.
Lae'zel,"Not a what, but a who. The immortal god-king of the githzerai - an exiled people, once kin with mine until the madness of civil war ripped our one sky into two."
Lae'zel,"Should they refuse, I carry on. Gravity pulls me in but one direction."
Lae'zel,Not mad. Pragmatic.
Lae'zel,"And if Menyar-Ag-Gith refuses, we carry on. Gravity pulls us in but one direction."
Lae'zel,"And when the Comet has risen, we will be forever together, as surely as K'liir will forever circle the Sun."
Lae'zel,"And when the Comet has risen, the githyanki will be free. Free to act, free to speak. Through us, they will feel the embrace of Mother Gith."
Lae'zel,"But nothing has made me quiver more than seeing your face here today, tentacles and all."
Lae'zel,But nothing has made me quiver more than seeing your face here today.
Lae'zel,It's nice to hear it.
Lae'zel,But soon - soon I'll find some way to see you in flesh. To touch you as you are meant to be touched.
Lae'zel,"Trust me - my blade is keen as ever. But it was here, in Faerûn, where I learned a proper victory doesn't always require a razor-sharp edge."
Lae'zel,A bit.
Lae'zel,Our gish sent word of the rebellion to Menyar-Ag-Gith through the cosmos. He's agreed to parley.
Lae'zel,"I wouldn't expect you to. The capital city of the githzerai - an exiled people, once kin with mine until the madness of civil war ripped our one sky into two."
Lae'zel,Let's say 'both'. I can't imagine a greater pleasure than Vlaakith's unmaking.
Lae'zel,No need to pretend - I know the word means little to you.
Lae'zel,"Not all of us can play the weave like a lyre, Gale. Orpheus may be Prince of the Comet, but he is not a god."
Lae'zel,"We've spilled blood, gained a foothold in the Astral. But still, we need allies. And one beyond reckoning has made itself known:"
Lae'zel,Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith.
Lae'zel,Shra'kt'lor.
Lae'zel,It's fallen to me to secure an alliance.
Lae'zel,Minsc?! The same Minsc Jaheira's been looking for?
Lae'zel,"He is also a near-deity. Should the githzerai join us, we could topple The City of Death in a red dragon's blink. "
Lae'zel,Xan is safe - don't you worry that horned head of yours.
Lae'zel,"Besides, if anyone so much as looked at him funny, I know you'd turn them to bloodchunks."
Lae'zel,I do enjoy a bit of casual bloodshed. Now come - I'd like to know more about this 'Z'rell'.
Lae'zel,"I, too, crave blood. But even I know to avoid battle when fortune's tides flow against me."
Lae'zel,Something in his eyes tells me he'll take after you more than me. A hellshunter with a graceful soul and a burning heart.
Lae'zel,"Worth every one of those days and every drop of their sweat. Right here, right now, there's no other place I'd sooner be."
Lae'zel,"Enjoy your night, chatter away. For tomorrow, we face Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith."
Lae'zel,Stealing your ally is one thing. Stealing your face? An ignoble act by any estimation.
Lae'zel,"Heh. I was as surprised as anyone when Orpheus spoke the order, my love."
Lae'zel,"I do. Menyar-Ag-Gith is an ascetic. He reached out in good faith. He will aid us if we meet him in the same spirit, my love."
Lae'zel,"And if he refuses, we carry on. Gravity pulls us in but one direction."
Lae'zel,I do. Menyar-Ag-Gith is an ascetic. He reached out in good faith. He will aid us if we meet him in the same spirit.
Lae'zel,"Menyar-Ag-Gith is an ascetic. He reached out in good faith. This is his way. It is in this spirit that we must meet him, my love."
Lae'zel,Menyar-Ag-Gith is an ascetic. He reached out in good faith. This is his way. It is in this spirit that we must meet him.
Lae'zel,"We've spilled blood, gained a foothold in the Astral. But still, we need allies. And one beyond reckoning has made himself known."
Lae'zel,"You might as well ask if the stars will ever snuff out, or Avernus freeze over. A consideration for the far future."
Lae'zel,Heh. I was as surprised as anyone when Orpheus spoke the order.
Lae'zel,"If a warrior's lacerations are beyond even their ability, the victim is beheaded."
Lae'zel,My blade is keen as ever. But it was you who showed me that a proper victory doesn't always require a razor-sharp edge.
Lae'zel,"And sometimes, a bewitching smirk-and-quip gets the job done, Astarion-style."
Lae'zel,"Xan's destiny will be his own to follow. Warrior, poet, explorer, scholar. His way will be the way of the Comet:"
Lae'zel,"No chains to bind us, no lies to bury us. Liberty will be the rallying cry that unites our empire."
Lae'zel,He is with the mages of Xamvadi'm. I'd trust his care to no one else.
Lae'zel,"And to you, Source of my Joy."
Lae'zel,Soon - soon I'll find some way to see you in flesh. To touch you as you are meant to be touched.
Lae'zel,"And to you, Shadowheart."
Lae'zel,"And to you, Astarion."
Lae'zel,Xan is with the mages of Xamvadi'm. I'd trust his care to no one else.
Lae'zel,"And to you, Gale."
Lae'zel,"And to you, Wyll."
Lae'zel,"And to you, always."
Lae'zel,"Yisk Gith'ka tavki krash'ht., she'lak."
Lae'zel,"You'd know better than anyone, my love."
Lae'zel,"Menyar-Ag-Gith is an ascetic. He reached out in good faith. This is his way. It is in this spirit that I must meet him, my love."
Lae'zel,"And if Menyar-Ag-Gith refuses, I carry on."
Lae'zel,"Not mad, my love. Pragmatic."
Lae'zel,"And to you, Karlach."
Lae'zel,"Sometimes, a sincere plea is more persuasive than a dagger against the neck."
Lae'zel,I'll be back one day. The Overgod himself couldn't keep me away.
Lae'zel,"I missed this place. More to the point, I missed you."
Lae'zel,Menyar-Ag-Gith is an ascetic. He reached out in good faith. This is his way. It is in this spirit that I must meet him.
Lae'zel,"And if he refuses, I carry on. Gravity pulls me in but one direction."
Lae'zel,"O! That I could touch you in flesh, run my hands across your skin."
Lae'zel,"Worth every one of those days and every drop of their sweat, I promise you."
Lae'zel,I know the feeling all too well.
Lae'zel,But that I can be in your presence at all is a wonder of its own.
Lae'zel,"Let's make the most of the moment, I say. May I kiss you?"
Lae'zel,"I missed this place. More to the point, I missed you. I wouldn't even deny it with Vlaakith's vorpal blade at my neck. Though I'd rather it not come to that."
Lae'zel,I need you.
Lae'zel,More to the point - I missed you.
Lae'zel,"But I'll be back to see you again when the Comet has risen, as surely as K'liir will forever circle the Sun."
Lae'zel,More to the point - I missed you. I wouldn't even deny it with Vlaakith's vorpal blade at my neck. Though I'd rather it not come to that.
Lae'zel,"Now go, mingle a bit. That's the word, right? 'Mingle?'"
Lae'zel,"But don't think you've seen the last of me. I'll be back, sure as the Comet will rise, sure as K'liir will forever circle the Sun."
Lae'zel,"But for now, I say we make the most of the moment. May I kiss you?"
Lae'zel,"Soon - when the Comet has risen, when the lich queen has crumbled to dust."
Lae'zel,"I suppose it is, rather. I'm just glad to be here at all."
Lae'zel,"Yes. Devour the traitor, my queen be praised!"
Lae'zel,A waste of space and resources. Gith triage methods obviate the need for such crude facilities.
Lae'zel,"Two sides, each itching to draw blades against the other."
Lae'zel,"I am called Lae'zel, Champion-Elect of the Six Arms of Tun'arath."
Lae'zel,"I do not hail from this land, but from Crèche K'liir."
Lae'zel,I've come to fulfil my final test: collecting a mind flayer's head.
Lae'zel,"If I'm to end the Netherbrain and its Grand Design, it seems I must call you ally. But I will never call you my prince."
Lae'zel,"Orpheus, rotten seed of great Mother Gith, shame of the Empire."
Lae'zel,My crèche has asked me to learn of local customs.
Lae'zel,I will deliver the message as you command.
Lae'zel,Seize the chance to attack.
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith's mission is eternal, immutable. Our path ends here. On this day, Gith's son shall perish by my hands."
Lae'zel,"My Prince, no!"
Lae'zel,"My Prince, you cannot. This is not your burden to bear!"
Lae'zel,"It is etched in slate. So says Vlaakith, and so it must be."
Lae'zel,I've heard enough. My Queen demands your head. It is time I take it.
Lae'zel,"Your Majesty. The Prince of the Comet, Gith's true heir. It is an honour."
Lae'zel,Then your choice is made - and so is mine.
Lae'zel,"My time is short, rider. We must speak."
Lae'zel,"Stand down, knight. I do not have what you seek!"
Lae'zel,"Voss, Knight Supreme. The queen's silver, the queen's sword."
Lae'zel,...Lae'zel.
Lae'zel,"...and the Grand Design will be stopped. An honourable contingency, Gale. And one I mean to avoid."
Lae'zel,Enough of this. We take his head here and now.
Lae'zel,"Please - whatever Prince Orpheus asks of us, we must obey."
Lae'zel,"You're distracted. Speak, or let your thoughts haunt you."
Lae'zel,"Even now, at the cusp, you waste your breath on prattle."
Lae'zel,"At last, we wash our weapons in Absolute blood."
Lae'zel,"A hovering mass of grey matter, sprouted with lethal tentacles and oozing cerebrospinal fluid."
Lae'zel,"Your senses are still intact, then. Unchain the prince. Let the githyanki be free."
Lae'zel,"We should have been disarmed on entry. I'm pleased we weren't, but it's strange."
Lae'zel,"You have shared your new power with your lover, Astarion. I'm surprised - I expected you to turn your back once you got what you wanted."
Lae'zel,"It makes you less watchful. We're panting after battle, and already your maws are glued."
Lae'zel,"Astarion, I note you and your lover struggle to keep your hands off one another."
Lae'zel,The traitor prince. Vlaakith's would-be usurper.
Lae'zel,Let the histories show: Lae'zel of K'liir shattered the Prince of the Comet!
Lae'zel,Rider - my time is short. Lead me to...
Lae'zel,"Reddened cheeks, wild eyes - I know that look. And you best keep this... little problem to yourself.<br>"
Lae'zel,We are permitted to walk so freely. Such a lack of discipline would be punished severely in K'liir.
Lae'zel,I will not just stand by while you consume the future of my people.
Lae'zel,Hta'zith!
Lae'zel,Do nothing.
Lae'zel,A warrior who winks at her foes while she slays them. You'd be a fool to refuse her.
Lae'zel,"Hells. By the sacred silver, who will lead our people to glory, if not Mother Gith's son?"
Lae'zel,"See that corpse? Arabella's father, in the oh-so-decaying flesh."
Lae'zel,"See that corpse? Arabella's mother, in the oh-so-decaying flesh."
Lae'zel,"A tiefling. Must be Arabella's mother. What's left of her, anyway."
Lae'zel,"Unless, of course, I have offered it."
Lae'zel,"Fine - he stays, 'til he's no longer of use. Besides, my flesh is not so easily tasted."
Lae'zel,"One question of many, I promise you."
Lae'zel,"Only a beast of a man toys with his victim. Entertaining, if not efficient."
Lae'zel,A dead githyanki. The corpse may hold something useful.
Lae'zel,We are mighty - but we've no chance to fell such a legion. We must turn back.
Lae'zel,A true coward's words. Do you trust me so little to think I'd lead you to death's maw?
Lae'zel,"Deny your hunger and free Orpheus, or I will bathe this place in your silver blood!"
Lae'zel,- but I cannot let you live!
Lae'zel,"I see that look, I know that look. If this is how the traitor prince must die, then let it be so!"
Lae'zel,"I see that look, I know that look. Don't you dare."
Lae'zel,"I stand with the Prince of the Comet. Attack, and you perish by my hand."
Lae'zel,"You were always a stubborn one, Gale. Well - if this is to be your end, then you have made the most of it."
Lae'zel,Near to bursting. The next few sips could be his last.
Lae'zel,"Do it. Take his mind, and be quick."
Lae'zel,Quickly read the meaning of his gestures.
Lae'zel,Allow him access to your mind.
Lae'zel,"Arabella's father, in the oh-so-decaying flesh."
Lae'zel,"Must be Arabella's father. What's left of him, anyway."
Lae'zel,Will yourself to resist his probing.
Lae'zel,Enough games. You will die by my hand!
Lae'zel,Half-wit!
Lae'zel,Hells. The curse has twisted this man beyond measure...
Lae'zel,What? Half-wit! I have not suffered for you to deny me!
Lae'zel,"Impressive. Last I saw this child, she was cowed to Kagha's snake."
Lae'zel,"Plucked from Kagha's talons, only to run to the shadows. Fickle, the both of you."
Lae'zel,Capricious child. She almost got herself killed once. Seems she's intent on finishing the job.
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith, yes. The undying lich, the slaver of the githyanki."
Lae'zel,Perhaps. And how many more millennia will we need to wait?
Lae'zel,"When the brain is dead, I go my way - you go yours."
Lae'zel,Her fate was writ the moment she fled.
Lae'zel,Bah - I'll trust my chances without you. You are weak. You succumbed to temptation.
Lae'zel,We need to use the Netherstones on the Crown. That is our fated path.
Lae'zel,That face... the one in my dreams...
Lae'zel,"Poetry as torture - your master's quite clever, Astarion. Don't you agree?"
Lae'zel,Vlaakith holds dominion over the entire plane. And 'irritable' does not even begin to describe her.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith holds dominion over the entire plane. And she is not 'irritable' - she is ruthless.
Lae'zel,"Can you feel it crawling through you? Tendrils squirming in your chest, gripping your heart, piercing your belly? Your bones popping, your flesh swelling?"
Lae'zel,Florrick's will be hanged. Unless you'd care to intervene.
Lae'zel,Ch'k'l ghaik Vlaakith m' zath'ak!
Lae'zel,Your goddess calls. Serve her or denounce her as you will - but you cannot ignore her.
Lae'zel,Sha'vah Orpheus!
Lae'zel,"You've quite the appetite, Halsin. I'd wager you've bedded more of your foes than you've felled."
Lae'zel,"Mighty Voss, your words lift me. Vlaakith will splinter like glass and vanish like smoke."
Lae'zel,The Grand Design must be ended. A sacrifice had to be made.
Lae'zel,Voss - you know not what you speak of.
Lae'zel,"Silence your blasphemous tongue, Voss."
Lae'zel,This was a necessary sacrifice to end the Grand Design.
Lae'zel,Thank you. Orpheus would have asked for no less.
Lae'zel,"Thank you, Voss."
Lae'zel,It is true. Voss - I am no thrall. This was a necessary sacrifice to end the Grand Design.
Lae'zel,"Stand down, Voss. No githyanki will ever be free if the Netherbrain sparks the Grand Design!"
Lae'zel,"These flowers are quite vivid - not to mention, pungent. Not to my liking."
Lae'zel,Must have been a challenging kill.
Lae'zel,Exactly the sort of battle I live to fight. And the sort made even more thrilling with a hot-hearted tiefling at my side.
Lae'zel,I claim you for the Absolute!
Lae'zel,At what age do you think it is right to set a child upon mortal combat?
Lae'zel,Never. Thieves aren't afforded such luxury.
Lae'zel,"Our leader is a fool for love, Minthara. I'd never be compelled to conduct such a poorly-planned jailbreak."
Lae'zel,It will be far more satisfying to plunge a blade into Gortash myself than to pick through his ashes.
Lae'zel,It sounds terribly understimulating.
Lae'zel,"A dinner date. At first your request confused me. But then, I became curious..."
Lae'zel,Bones. Rusted weapons. A great battle was fought here.
Lae'zel,You were stronger than the others.
Lae'zel,Mindfully and meticulously.
Lae'zel,"In that way, you are like many a young githyanki - wise to the ways of battle, if not to the wider world."
Lae'zel,"Your years in the Hells have made you a fierce warrior, Karlach."
Lae'zel,I do not need awakening. My senses are sharp as steel.
Lae'zel,Smell that? Blood. This whole plain reeks of it.
Lae'zel,"To my people, all the planes are a vast garden to be weeded and picked."
Lae'zel,Yes  - and quite an attractive target for githyanki raiders. They'd plunder the village and fly off with the spoils.
Lae'zel,"Karlach, were there others of Zariel's warriors who bore the infernal engine?"
Lae'zel,"Either or both, so long as I get to spill blood."
Lae'zel,"Caution is commendable. Boldness is extraordinary. In this case, I recommend the latter."
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith is unity: fear and beauty, life and unlife. Eyes like onyx, teeth like daggers. There is none more perfect."
Lae'zel,"Drink, dance, and song. Tu'narath's residents are known to partake in all three. Substantially."
Lae'zel,"It will be my home soon enough, should Vlaakith will it."
Lae'zel,"Tell me, Gale: what is your interest in the Astral Plane?"
Lae'zel,"Tell him, or don't - it doesn't matter, so long as you grant me the killing blow."
Lae'zel,An acceptable conclusion. But it is a shame I won't know the pleasure of executing a wardevil.
Lae'zel,Well. There is always next time.
Lae'zel,There's no call to be insulting.
Lae'zel,"Eternity is long, Gale. Long enough to pursue endeavours beyond combat."
Lae'zel,What is this...? This place makes me feel sad. Melancholy.
Lae'zel,"Feed if you must, Astarion."
Lae'zel,I'm sure you'll find it instructive. Or do you simply want to avoid risking your pallid neck?
Lae'zel,"These Steel Watchers are impressive achievements. Worthy opponents, even for githyanki."
Lae'zel,"The more I learn of this plane, Astarion, the more I believe 'love' is its greatest disease."
Lae'zel,"All three stones are in hand. Finally, the elder brain will fall."
Lae'zel,It is in your nature to have tried. You have not.
Lae'zel,"Why have you not tried to lay with me, Astarion?"
Lae'zel,"But give me so much as a hungry look, and I'll drive a stake through your heart."
Lae'zel,"A tadpole nursery, as on the nautiloid. We must not leave it intact."
Lae'zel,"These children and their pets lack discipline. Were they githyanki, I'd recommend further training."
Lae'zel,As for the unruly animals - they would make for nutritious marching rations.
Lae'zel,"Gale, I've heard you talking in your sleep. Your mate needs better rest for our journey."
Lae'zel,"Only once. Did you know, In low-gravity settings, githyanki can maintain aerial suspension for hours at a time?"
Lae'zel,No - stop! This isn't the way!
Lae'zel,Again! The Grand Design must not come to pass!
Lae'zel,By Vlaakith's dragons!
Lae'zel,By Gith's silver blade!
Lae'zel,"Your beard looks like the hairy tufts upon the psurlon, the largest of wormkind that slither our skies."
Lae'zel,"That is the very purpose of training - to determine which children shall be warriors, and which are suited to other roles.<br>"
Lae'zel,"I am observing, not condoning. A meaningful difference."
Lae'zel,Its magic will quell the parasite in an instant.
Lae'zel,"One of many, but by no means the least. To die properly is a matter of honour."
Lae'zel,The right of these prisoners to die in mortal combat was stolen from them.
Lae'zel,Only if you found it funny.
Lae'zel,That may explain why most gnomes possess such short fuses.
Lae'zel,"Fireworks - a particularly gnomish field of art, no?"
Lae'zel,"You've a particular way with words, Gale. Perhaps oration suits you more than battle."
Lae'zel,"Cowards at every turn in this community. In githyanki society, they would be retrained - or culled."
Lae'zel,Voss waits at Sharess' Caress. I will retrieve the key that binds Orpheus - and then cleave him from brain to belly.
Lae'zel,A stunning starlit sky. To think there was a time when I scoffed at it.
Lae'zel,"I have seen my future in the shimmering visage of my queen, heard it in her thundering voice."
Lae'zel,My joy. Speak to me.
Lae'zel,I'd like the same.
Lae'zel,"We've discussed this. If you value our bond, you will honour my limits."
Lae'zel,Here? Now?
Lae'zel,"If it weren't apparent, it should be: I'm not keen on such outward displays of our flesh-bond."
Lae'zel,"Let there be no doubt: I have marked you, as you have me. In time, we might brazenly bare our marks."
Lae'zel,You favour me above Karlach. I suppose I should be flattered.
Lae'zel,That time's not yet come.
Lae'zel,"Yes, I hunger for you. But I have my limits, and you will respect them."
Lae'zel,"I won't be guilted into indulging your whims. I have my limits, and you will respect them."
Lae'zel,"I want you, too."
Lae'zel,"But we will have our time. And when we do, I will make your heart and flesh burn as hotly as you've ever known."
Lae'zel,Your eagerness is... curiously captivating.
Lae'zel,But you can rest your mind. I'm not one to indulge so publicly.
Lae'zel,*Sigh* Come. Let me taste.
Lae'zel,"Once your heart-machine is repaired, however, I intend to gorge on you in the privacy of my bunk."
Lae'zel,No matter. We've an elder brain to defeat. We can't waste energy on unneeded distractions.
Lae'zel,Mm.
Lae'zel,I'll enjoy winning it even more.
Lae'zel,I've noted your growing obsession with me.
Lae'zel,You favour me above Astarion. I suppose I should be flattered.
Lae'zel,"She'll make a fine lover, I'm sure. Let's hope she doesn't burn you to cinder before the day is out."
Lae'zel,I'm sure you do.
Lae'zel,I'd been thinking I'd take you again when the mood strikes. You were an even better lay than I expected.
Lae'zel,I see you've picked up a paramour.
Lae'zel,But I've sensed your indifference.
Lae'zel,"Is that so? Let's hope he doesn't tear off too much of your flesh, hm?"
Lae'zel,And so you chose Astarion in my place? I'm almost amused.
Lae'zel,But it heightens my cravings for you.
Lae'zel,Not that it matters. You've made your choice. I'd only debase myself by asking you to un-make it.
Lae'zel,"Of course you would. And if you pressed me, I might even say the same of you."
Lae'zel,So don't press me.
Lae'zel,"No matter - I've gone off the idea myself. We've an elder brain to destroy, and cannot risk unneeded distraction."
Lae'zel,"You are my today. And should fate will it, my tomorrow."
Lae'zel,You are the tastes of my tongue. You are the ground beneath me and the skies above.
Lae'zel,The one who gave significance to this trivial rock...
Lae'zel,You were wise to spare Karlach. She's got the brawn of a warrior and the wiles of a survivor.
Lae'zel,"Best of all, she speaks her mind, plainly and fully. Show her due respect."
Lae'zel,I do not trust Mystra to do right with the crown. But I think I trust Gale even less.
Lae'zel,"He must give it to her when the time comes, or his lust for power might well consume him."
Lae'zel,Orin thinks Gale's abduction is an ultimatum to kill Gortash.
Lae'zel,Foolish woman - as if I needed more reason than I already had.
Lae'zel,Hm.
Lae'zel,We're good and done with the Iron Throne - and I've no wish to return.
Lae'zel,Orin thinks Halsin's abduction is an ultimatum to kill Gortash.
Lae'zel,I knew I smelled the stink of cowardice.
Lae'zel,"Careful what you eat, Gale, You're positively oozing dark magic."
Lae'zel,Gale should watch what he eats. He's positively oozing dark magic. 
Lae'zel,Forward. You know what's required.
Lae'zel,"Another dream, another order from that dubious visitor."
Lae'zel,You have become the Slayer - or has a Slayer merely found a host too weak to evict it?
Lae'zel,Inside your every wound lives my obsession. Inside my every wound lives your passion.
Lae'zel,The pain is a mutual promise branded on our flesh and bone.
Lae'zel,"Exquisite, isn't it?"
Lae'zel,...and the one who unblinded me to a terrible truth: I had built my life on an empty foundation.
Lae'zel,Orpheus is the road to my freedom. And you are the reason to march down it.
Lae'zel,A pleasure more carnal than the smell of a fresh kill.
Lae'zel,"One day, I will achieve ascension, and I will revel in the psalms sung in Vlaakith's court."
Lae'zel,"Until then, you will be my ecstasy."
Lae'zel,"I had the audacity to invite a woman of your talents to strike me. You had the courage to stand against me, unflinching."
Lae'zel,"I had the audacity to invite a man of your talents to strike me. You had the courage to stand against me, unflinching."
Lae'zel,"I had the audacity to invite a person of your talents to strike me. You had the courage to stand against me, unflinching."
Lae'zel,"In so doing, you made yourself my possession and my obsession."
Lae'zel,This again?
Lae'zel,"'I am not yours, you are not mine.' Say the words."
Lae'zel,Then it is done.
Lae'zel,*Sigh* Good.
Lae'zel,But can we end this little game? It's not as amusing for me as it apparently is for you.
Lae'zel,Good. Then we needn't speak of this again.
Lae'zel,I'll enjoy the challenge.
Lae'zel,It announced that we will find the answers that we seek in the Absolute cultists' lair - and offered another generous 'gift'.
Lae'zel,Why should I not want to be wanted? This is not sentiment. It is a hunger to be satisfied.
Lae'zel,"I am Lae'zel of K'liir, born of Mother Gith. An enviable specimen even among my people."
Lae'zel,"So mad with power, he'd smash through the Githyanki Empire and deliver the shards to his illithid masters -"
Lae'zel,- and glowing with such psionic force that he and his red dragon blazed a trail through the skies. A lethal comet careening towards our people.
Lae'zel,- and glowing with such psionic force that he and his red dragon blazed a trail through the skies. A lethal comet careening towards my people.
Lae'zel,"Lies, of course. Vlaakith spread a false image of Orpheus as monstrous betrayer, and her knights as the butchers who sliced him through."
Lae'zel,"She was right to fear him, I'll grant her that. So great is the Comet, it could shatter her reign."
Lae'zel,You probably believe the illithid's twaddle about Vlaakith usurping Gith's throne as well.
Lae'zel,What about him?
Lae'zel,"The Astral Prison contains not one, but two atrocities. They will use you and abuse you at every opportunity."
Lae'zel,There is one truth: Vlaakith's truth. Everything else is apostasy.
Lae'zel,"The Emperor may be loathsome, but it's right."
Lae'zel,"Why destroy a weapon like that, when you can contain it in a relic and keep it for yourself?"
Lae'zel,"As loathsome as it is, the Emperor slipped one fact into its slurry of lies."
Lae'zel,The prince is a powerful shield - and a powerful weapon.
Lae'zel,"Terrific. If I'm ever harangued by a rodent, I'll know who to call for."
Lae'zel,She was caught? Foolish child - let them judge her.
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith was no fool. Why destroy a weapon like that, when you can contain it in a relic and keep it for yourself?"
Lae'zel,"More writings on Orpheus, the Prince of the Comet."
Lae'zel,Judicious advice. How puzzling.
Lae'zel,It is for the best.
Lae'zel,A traitor. A dead one.
Lae'zel,I am fine. The slate is not.
Lae'zel,Listen close. I'll read it to you.
Lae'zel,Hm. Quite similar to the boy's slate from the crèche.
Lae'zel,It's a story. About - about Orpheus.
Lae'zel,These tieflings prove fragile. I've a mind to end their misery myself.
Lae'zel,"I'll translate, then."
Lae'zel,Listen. I'll read you the text.
Lae'zel,"More writings on Orpheus, the so-called Prince of the Comet."
Lae'zel,Good. Let that be the end of it.
Lae'zel,You were never on my good side.
Lae'zel,I fail to see the distinction.
Lae'zel,Hmph. And you'd deny me the pleasure?
Lae'zel,"Better to leave it, I agree."
Lae'zel,A weapon is only an asset for as long as it isn't pointed at you.
Lae'zel,The means of Vlaakith's own end has been ripped away from her.
Lae'zel,Better to have Orpheus killed than to risk his escape.
Lae'zel,"Bah! At your age, I'd already spilled my own cousin's blood. Face your fear, or it will devour you."
Lae'zel,"Let's hope Astarion doesn't tear off too much of your flesh, hm?"
Lae'zel,"Either way, you look the fool."
Lae'zel,"What you really mean is that you're too mild for me. Why even live, if you don't live intensely?"
Lae'zel,"Yes, I'm sure you see it that way."
Lae'zel,"Karlach will make a fine lover, I'm sure. Let's hope she doesn't burn you to cinder before the day is out."
Lae'zel,I am not yours. You are not mine. Or so I've come to believe.
Lae'zel,"Gale should be just to your tastes. Vanilla, to be precise."
Lae'zel,You've made a choice. Or maybe you'll pretend Minthara made it for you.
Lae'zel,"Either way, I could hardly care less."
Lae'zel,You favour me above Gale. I suppose I should be flattered.
Lae'zel,You favour me above Wyll. I suppose I should be flattered.
Lae'zel,You favour me above Shadowheart. I suppose I should be flattered.
Lae'zel,"And I am, to be truthful."
Lae'zel,"And you favour Minthara, no less. I thought you valued yourself. Minthara certainly doesn't."
Lae'zel,Fine with me.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith will know my unfaltering faith. Neither death nor the Absolute will keep me from accomplishing my duty.
Lae'zel,Protocol three-hundred-one. 'Neither death nor undeath may be a hindrance to Vlaakith's blessing.'
Lae'zel,Better to risk the rise of illithids than let the Prince of the Comet deny her the godhood she craves.
Lae'zel,The means of the githyanki people's end has been ripped from the venerable queen.
Lae'zel,Better to kill Orpheus than to risk the enemy wielding his power.
Lae'zel,"Orpheus' honour guard, loyal to the end -"
Lae'zel,"- trapped by Vlaakith in the same Prism holding their noble prince, fruitlessly hacking at the sphere that contains him."
Lae'zel,I regret their deaths. But I pledge to live as they perished: in the service of Gith's son.
Lae'zel,"- and trapped by Vlaakith in the same Prism holding their prince, fruitlessly hacking at the sphere that contains him."
Lae'zel,I do not share what is mine. And I will not be shared.
Lae'zel,"So loyal, so beguiled, they were blind to his treason."
Lae'zel,Do not embarrass yourself. He is gone.
Lae'zel,"Brave of you to admit your shortcomings, Shadowheart."
Lae'zel,I know my mission. Nothing will turn me from it.
Lae'zel,My queen would demand I slay her greatest enemy. I could not be more certain.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith has a plan. And she knows what part I must play.
Lae'zel,And she cannot reward me if I hand the empire to the illithid thrall called Orpheus.
Lae'zel,Of course you crave me. Just as I crave you.
Lae'zel,Stay your hand. This is neither the time nor the place.
Lae'zel,"A persuasive creature. It tempts us with power, expresses its admiration, its adoration."
Lae'zel,"You've no idea what damage it could do to us, how far into illithid madness it could drag us."
Lae'zel,"And either like a coward or a fool, you tremble."
Lae'zel,Perhaps the parasite has weakened you. Or perhaps - perhaps you still long for my taste.
Lae'zel,"I never promised more than a night - though I can't deny the lure of your taste. Sweet, yes, but also bitter as ginger."
Lae'zel,Tempt me.
Lae'zel,Like the shield-bearer and pikeman must train to march their formation in tandem.
Lae'zel,"You are exceptional amongst our pack. You are clearly their leader, and they look to you for guidance. That, I admire."
Lae'zel,"Ever since we shared each others' flesh, I've caught you looking at me with lidded eyes."
Lae'zel,"Yes. I have the pick of Faerûn's litter, though all I see are runts. They are the rule; you are the exception."
Lae'zel,Why would a lesser act spark greater desire in you?
Lae'zel,And you've never strangled a Berbalang with your bare hands.
Lae'zel,"I remember your heartbeat from before. Quick, light, like a frightened rabbit."
Lae'zel,"I'll keep your request in mind. Perform well, and perhaps I'll consider it."
Lae'zel,Enough! I have given you my word. Do not be late.
Lae'zel,I did not say it was unwelcome. Should a warrior not enjoy the flattery of her admirers?
Lae'zel,Very well. I will claim you once you have taken to rest.
Lae'zel,"Besides, I can't deny the lure of your taste. Sweet, yes, but also bitter as ginger."
Lae'zel,"You are still my friend, my fellow warrior. And still the source of my bruises."
Lae'zel,I've been pierced by a beholder's rays and sliced open by a neogi's talon. But this wound will run much deeper.
Lae'zel,"Let me down, and I'll show you true might!"
Lae'zel,Zhak vo'n'ash duj.
Lae'zel,"I thought I'd seen the whole of you. Mighty as Tiamat's dragons, monumental as the One in the Void."
Lae'zel,"But now I see more in you still. You are iron and steel, yes - but you are also silk and satin."
Lae'zel,"Soon, I would know you again. Not to claw you, but to caress you. Not to be burned in your heat -"
Lae'zel,- but to be bathed in your warmth.
Lae'zel,"Our flesh-bond is broken, but our alliance is not. Our kinship will be the blade that cleaves the our enemies."
Lae'zel,Mm. You crave the icy heat of iron and steel.
Lae'zel,As have I.
Lae'zel,"Truthfully, it took more courage to ask for a soft touch than it would to meet the gaze of the Ninefold Dragon."
Lae'zel,"Thus far I've taunted you, devoured you, battled you."
Lae'zel,"Now, I want more than anything to soothe you."
Lae'zel,"Let us hope, then, that time does not too quickly run out."
Lae'zel,Hells.
Lae'zel,"Then I will give you that, and more. I will burn you, bite you, brand you with the wounds of my obsession."
Lae'zel,Just when my tongue was craving a second sample.
Lae'zel,"A monster forms inside us, and you think to be idle?"
Lae'zel,I did not expect you to prove quite so... fragile.
Lae'zel,"Next time you're able, look to the sky, watch the moon cross it."
Lae'zel,"But enough of this. You are wasting your resting time. Come dawn, we resume our search for a crèche."
Lae'zel,"Then perhaps you've unknowingly gazed at my crèche, K'liir, as it tumbled past."
Lae'zel,"You are wise not to waste your resting time. Come dawn, we resume our search for a crèche."
Lae'zel,A dragon's heart beats inside you. A dragon's blood heats your flesh.
Lae'zel,It is time I take what's mine.
Lae'zel,"Would that I were doing battle up there, among the Tears."
Lae'zel,Open.
Lae'zel,Good. Lower.
Lae'zel,It's time I return to my bunk.
Lae'zel,Go to sleep. Our hunt resumes at sunup.
Lae'zel,It's time to rise. Dawn is upon us.
Lae'zel,Hmm - you do look peaked.
Lae'zel,Very well. Take your moment.
Lae'zel,Taste.
Lae'zel,The moonlight shines warmly on us. The breeze caresses our faces.
Lae'zel,"A fine evening, don't you think?"
Lae'zel,As if I craved another whiff of sour breath.
Lae'zel,Be quick about your rest. We must hurry towards the crèche.
Lae'zel,A thickheaded notion in a complex circumstance.
Lae'zel,"The parasites inside us do not rest. Even as we speak, they defile our brains and warp our bones. "
Lae'zel,You would doubt me?
Lae'zel,Take your rest. I will stand watch.
Lae'zel,"Should a single tentacle split your skull, I will not hesitate to end you."
Lae'zel,Be quick about your rest. We must locate a crèche.
Lae'zel,I knew your kind to be fragile. But I didn't foresee the severity.
Lae'zel,"A monster forms inside us, yet you waste time with idle chatter."
Lae'zel,About you? No.
Lae'zel,Disturbing.
Lae'zel,"Abominations grow inside us. Our bones should ache, our mouths should bleed."
Lae'zel,"Fortunate for you, slaying monstrous fanatics is a pastime of ours."
Lae'zel,Keep your rest short. Time is not our ally.
Lae'zel,"Our bones should ache, our mouths should bleed."
Lae'zel,"Let me down, and we will prove our people's might!"
Lae'zel,"Avert your eyes, whenever it appears. And do not avail yourself of this new power, no matter how alluring."
Lae'zel,Stand down!
Lae'zel,Vlaakith curse you!
Lae'zel,"This is the city proper, is it? I didn't expect it to be so outrageously... ordinary."
Lae'zel,Astarion chose right. And any well-trained githyanki would have chosen the same.
Lae'zel,"We seek might not for individual power, but for the good of the collective."
Lae'zel,"I may no longer serve Vlaakith, but I still attend to a collective - the allies of the Prince of the Comet. And, of course, the one we've made for ourselves."
Lae'zel,"Every enemy I slay strengthens not only myself, but the Githyanki Empire."
Lae'zel,To seek power for personal glory alone is a farce. Astarion was wise to see it.
Lae'zel,"A wise choice. These parasites are a threat to be destroyed, not an opportunity to be exploited."
Lae'zel,You know what you must do.
Lae'zel,I will not be party to Orpheus' murder. I will not let you assimilate the Prince of the Comet!
Lae'zel,You've chosen your loyalties. Good. It is always best to know where one's allies - and enemies - stand.
Lae'zel,Shadowheart's chosen her loyalties. Good. It is always best to know where one's allies - and enemies - stand.
Lae'zel,"Your fate may be written, but your story isn't ended."
Lae'zel,"Karlach's fate may be written, but her story isn't ended."
Lae'zel,The histories of the greatest githyanki warriors are recorded in slate. They are unerasable.
Lae'zel,"With that amulet, the Lord of Murder has claimed you. Let us see what you make of his 'gift'."
Lae'zel,The air is thick with blood. I can't see it - but I can smell it.
Lae'zel,You're delusional. I'd sooner trust a night hag than a strange figure bearing dream-gifts.
Lae'zel,"He will help us defeat the Netherbrain, and lead the githyanki people to a glorious future."
Lae'zel,"Battles are won with swords, not mind-games born of brain-worms. The ones we fight with these cultists will be no different."
Lae'zel,Yes - the one truth that fell out of its cankered lips.
Lae'zel,"Well chosen. Battles are won with swords, not mind-games born of brain-worms. "
Lae'zel,If you wish.
Lae'zel,We should tell Dame Aylin of Lorroakan's intentions.
Lae'zel,I look forward to helping her pound this whelp's skull to grit.
Lae'zel,Do make her feel as unwelcome as you can.
Lae'zel,"Your lust for power is... concerning, Gale."
Lae'zel,Hm - the statue wasn't prepared for this eventuality. It figured we solved every trial successfully.
Lae'zel,Give it to her when the time comes. You will find no redemption or honour in godhood - only the burden of a million empty souls looking for a saviour you can never be.
Lae'zel,"Something is... different about you. New facial creases, perhaps? A fresh battlescar I hadn't noticed?"
Lae'zel,"Something is... different about Shadowheart. New facial creases, perhaps? A fresh battlescar I hadn't noticed?"
Lae'zel,Bah - it eludes me.
Lae'zel,Strike down the Emperor and break Orpheus free with the hammer.
Lae'zel,I do not trust Mystra to do right with the crown. But I think I trust you even less.
Lae'zel,"It is no small thing, to slay one's life-bringers. You did what was right, not what was easy."
Lae'zel,Karlach? Are you all right?
Lae'zel,Just give her a moment.
Lae'zel,Get rid of her.
Lae'zel,Kill them.
Lae'zel,I know what grows inside you. And I know of a cure.
Lae'zel,Get rid of them.
Lae'zel,You.
Lae'zel,You again. Get rid of him.
Lae'zel,Full-fledged vampires are not so easily slain. Astarion's master will be no exception.
Lae'zel,Kill him.
Lae'zel,"Prove you're not a craven. Join me, or die."
Lae'zel,Coward.
Lae'zel,Traitor.
Lae'zel,"You've but one chance. Join me, or die."
Lae'zel,Enough dawdling. Get me down.
Lae'zel,Control yourself!
Lae'zel,Get rid of him.
Lae'zel,Full-fledged vampires are not so easily slain. Your master will be no exception.
Lae'zel,"Such an elaborate trial - the sort Vlaakith subjects Tu'narath's elders to, should they grow too decadent. "
Lae'zel,To seek power for personal glory alone is a farce. A shame he can't see it.
Lae'zel,"It is no small thing, to slay one's life-bringers. Shadowheart did what was right, not what was easy."
Lae'zel,Shar's spirit lingers here. The air's thick with lies and trickery.
Lae'zel,"Give it to her when the time comes, or your lust for power might well consume you."
Lae'zel,The people are fickle. Do you suppose they'll invite a veritable devil to be Grand Duke?
Lae'zel,The 'people' are fickle. Do you suppose they'll invite you to be a Grand Duke on mere faith?
Lae'zel,Yes - hail the Grand Duke...
Lae'zel,"Assimilate the prince and become illithid. This is how we will end the prince, and this is how we will defeat the Netherbrain."
Lae'zel,Karlach's got the brawn of a warrior and the wiles of a survivor.
Lae'zel,I will remain. I've a vested interest in the outcome.
Lae'zel,The seat of the Absolute - and the source of our altered tadpoles.
Lae'zel,Brush off the pain - there is no time to waste.
Lae'zel,"Rub your forehead. Can you feel the tadpole, wriggling inside?"
Lae'zel,"Meditate on the words of your queen. Through them, you will find calm."
Lae'zel,"Stay your blade when you're able. Interrogate who you can. Answers first, bloodshed later."
Lae'zel,Astarion succumbed to his power-lust. A githyanki would have known better.
Lae'zel,Enough!
Lae'zel,"Love? I might give you a lay, should my whims so take me."
Lae'zel,If you must. Nothing good can come of it. 
Lae'zel,"Ephelomon remains the queen's consort to this day, as endless as the empire he now serves."
Lae'zel,Yes. But be warned - I play to win.
Lae'zel,You know me as I know myself. Glory be to my queen.
Lae'zel,"I would not be ascended - not by my own will, and not by Vlaakith's. Are you truly so indifferent to me?"
Lae'zel,Nonsense - my faith remains strong. Do you think so little of me that you'd believe this?
Lae'zel,Bah - trivialities. Have you been so inattentive?
Lae'zel,"What would you know of K'liir? I trained, I studied, I excelled. I had no need of friends."
Lae'zel,We must find our kind and be rid of the parasite. It's as simple as that.
Lae'zel,"Mm. I took my pleasure, and it was done. I've devoted few thoughts to it since."
Lae'zel,"I suggest you stop speaking - for your own health, of course."
Lae'zel,"All we have seen, all that has changed, and you still cling to old crusades."
Lae'zel,I should know not to underestimate you. You see me with clear eyes and open mind. 
Lae'zel,"An illuminating exercise. You've listened, if not always with both ears in attendance."
Lae'zel,I suppose I should be grateful - you helped me shed any illusions that you've been paying attention.
Lae'zel,"Quite right. This is my fate, wrought by loyalty, entrusted to Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,A fateful night. I'm not apt to forget it - or who spent it with me.
Lae'zel,"I will carry the truth to my people, whatever it might mean. Only time will tell how I'm remembered."
Lae'zel,"Because I do not intend to let this happen. Not to me, and if you stick with me, not to you."
Lae'zel,"All skin will turn to gore, and be shed to reveal new flesh underneath."
Lae'zel,Of course you haven't. They would have cut you from navel to neck.
Lae'zel,And they didn't cut you from navel to neck?
Lae'zel,Well...
Lae'zel,Perhaps they were otherwise occupied. 
Lae'zel,"Yes. Given the chance, most would cut you from navel to neck."
Lae'zel,Great is your fortune that I've let you live.
Lae'zel,"Then you have ceased to exist, and a mind flayer is born."
Lae'zel,I understand much beyond your comprehension.
Lae'zel,It is imperative we locate a crèche. You'd do well to observe more and question less.
Lae'zel,Yes. In great detail. It starts with a fever and memory loss.
Lae'zel,Your ignorance concerns me.
Lae'zel,It starts with a fever and memory loss.
Lae'zel,Then you start to hallucinate. Your hair falls out and you bleed from every orifice.
Lae'zel,Your bones will change form. Your jaw will split to allow room for four great tentacles.
Lae'zel,"More to the point, I know the cure for our condition."
Lae'zel,"Bah - my people already know liberty. Once, the illithids enslaved us; thanks to Vlaakith, we remain free."
Lae'zel,"I will be feared, this much is true. As a monster? No. As a champion? Most certainly."
Lae'zel,"You confuse fiction for fact. Even at my most loyal, I never longed for the githyanki throne."
Lae'zel,"You hide in the Dark Lady's shadows, threading lies and mysteries out of her decaying weave."
Lae'zel,"I can't say what you hoped to gain by lifting your veil, apart from rotting the air with lies yet untold."
Lae'zel,"But I must applaud your honesty, at very least."
Lae'zel,Now I know to keep a blade at the ready should you slink too close.
Lae'zel,A quest for power and a goddess' retribution - a classic tale of hubris. A folly even the githyanki are known to suffer from.
Lae'zel,"Not that I could relate, of course."
Lae'zel,You would do well not to squander it; a githyanki's goodwill is even rarer than a Sharran of integrity.
Lae'zel,My choices seem simple enough. One: Slay you and be done with it. Two: Go my own way. Three: Keep you well-fed with powerful magic.
Lae'zel,"So choice three it is: we will fatten you with the artefacts you require. And when I need your aid, I'll make certain you return the favour."
Lae'zel,A fair trade by any estimation.
Lae'zel,"That doesn't mean his every word carries wisdom, however."
Lae'zel,"Near as I can tell, your goddess demands faith - but holds no faith in you. "
Lae'zel,Why else would she demand you sacrifice yourself and perhaps so many others?
Lae'zel,Does she not think you can destroy the Absolute with your own immense talents? Does she not know the mighty company that you keep?
Lae'zel,"The first two are tempting, I must say - but a good wizard's spells are as valuable to me as my blade is to them."
Lae'zel,"If it was offered in good faith, then I will offer mine in return."
Lae'zel,A pearl of honesty - an unexpected and iridescent gift from a cleric of Shar.
Lae'zel,That you would shine a light into your own shadowed heart? More telling still.
Lae'zel,"Not today. Or any other time, come to think of it."
Lae'zel,I'd sooner slice off both my hands and feed them to a rabid boar.
Lae'zel,We must find my kind and be rid of the parasite. It's as simple as that.
Lae'zel,"The first symptoms should have long since started, though. That is what puzzles me."
Lae'zel,Yes. If you give it no further thought. But anomalies lead to surprises.
Lae'zel,Bad surprises.
Lae'zel,"Besides, what hasn't happened may yet come to pass."
Lae'zel,Fine.
Lae'zel,That shiver betrays your fear. Suppress it. It is useless.
Lae'zel,Words forged in steel. May your actions express the same mettle.
Lae'zel,"We were flayed, beaten, burned, and poisoned in our training."
Lae'zel,"It is our duty to withstand suffering, and our pleasure to conquer it."
Lae'zel,Come. We must locate a crèche. Observe everything. Assume nothing.
Lae'zel,I was trained on Crèche K'liir among the Tears of Selûne.
Lae'zel,I know all too little.
Lae'zel,"Yes - best to keep quiet, lest any drivel leak from your lips."
Lae'zel,"Demanding Vlaakith may be, but she acts for the good of the githyanki people. Mystra is concerned only for herself."
Lae'zel,No matter. I do not intend to stay long in this place.
Lae'zel,Dignified.
Lae'zel,"The object must be returned to our people, by our hands or another's."
Lae'zel,"The object must be returned to my people, by my hands or another's."
Lae'zel,"I understand there's an aphorism among your kind. One of my cousins at Crèche K'liir uttered it, and I damned near sliced out her tongue for it."
Lae'zel,'Let bygones be bygones.'
Lae'zel,The githyanki teach a different maxim: 'The sheathed blade remains just as sharp.'
Lae'zel,"What do you think of it, Shadowheart?"
Lae'zel,Such insufferable shrieking. May we not kick the child instead?
Lae'zel,I ask for a certain modicum of respect.
Lae'zel,"And the less respectful you are, the stronger my urge becomes to unsheathe my allusive blade."
Lae'zel,I will not attack if you give me no reason. Is that assurance enough?
Lae'zel,"There's much you might have said, but chose not to."
Lae'zel,"We may have reached a truce, but that does not mean my allusive blade will grow dull."
Lae'zel,A fine show of force. The worms shall feast tonight.
Lae'zel,"You strike your prey, then offer aid? Deplorable."
Lae'zel,"The more secrets you keep from me, the less respectful you are."
Lae'zel,"You strike your prey, then offer aid? I will never understand your kind."
Lae'zel,"Had Shadowheart produced the relic, she would have lived. She chose deceit over her own life."
Lae'zel,"I may even avail myself of his talents again, should I require it."
Lae'zel,Elders and collectives abide by their own tenets. It would require a powerful Creed to unite them.
Lae'zel,"And now this voice, this Creed, finds our own ears. If it reaches this plane, it may reach others."
Lae'zel,"An elder brain. It lives without body, without armour, save the brine pool it inhabits."
Lae'zel,"To split one apart is a githyanki's great pleasure. To die to its mind-blast, a githyanki's dread."
Lae'zel,"Enough stalling. Finish her, and be quick about it."
Lae'zel,Perhaps. 'Absolute' may be a mere pseudonym behind which this master hides.
Lae'zel,"You both lack imagination. Eye to eye with bliss, and you choose banality in its stead."
Lae'zel,Buffoonery - and you believe it no more than I do.
Lae'zel,"A ulitharid? A powerful servant, but a servant all the same."
Lae'zel,One of the leaders. Split her skull and be done with it.
Lae'zel,"They unite under one Creed. And if it reaches our ears on this plane, it may reach others."
Lae'zel,A possibility. Yet it would require a powerful Creed to unite the Elders.
Lae'zel,"So I did, and he served his use. Most enthusiastically, I might add."
Lae'zel,"I may even avail myself of his talents again, should he keep his fangs off my flesh."
Lae'zel,"Whatever this voice, whomever this master, it dominates dreams and unites minds.<br>"
Lae'zel,Take his head. He won't be putting it to good use.
Lae'zel,"And the more secrets you keep, the stronger my urge will be to unsheathe it."
Lae'zel,"First, we find a way to free Orpheus from his astral chains. Then, we cleave him from brain to belly."
Lae'zel,Yes - I presume your kind would sooner shelter in darkness than face conflict.
Lae'zel,"Otherwise, it festers. It becomes a parasite of its own. Ignore it at your peril."
Lae'zel,"As are your sort, I expect. Am I your first?"
Lae'zel,I expect I am your first.
Lae'zel,Those diminutive scales of yours look like mistakes.
Lae'zel,You look out of proportion. An oversized lizard with delusions of grandeur.
Lae'zel,End him or leave him. But don't you dare grovel to this slug.
Lae'zel,No matter - I don't intend to keep my eyes trained on you for longer than necessary.
Lae'zel,"That large, fleshy nose of yours looks like a mistake."
Lae'zel,"Decadent, then. "
Lae'zel,Lacking in economy.
Lae'zel,Like so much of this world and its undisciplined people.
Lae'zel,'Better' is an opinion. But mine is certainly more economical.
Lae'zel,Disciplined.
Lae'zel,'Better' is an opinion. I much prefer githyanki aesthetic to 'undersized wyrm'.
Lae'zel,You let him keep his foot? I'd have sliced it clean off.
Lae'zel,"Let us leave it to your imagination, shall we?"
Lae'zel,Let us hope we don't see it again.
Lae'zel,"But remember this: The more secrets you keep, the stronger my urge to unsheathe my allusive blade."
Lae'zel,"It is over, where I am concerned."
Lae'zel,It is through conflict that we strengthen our bonds.
Lae'zel,"Can we not find a more pleasant amusement? Gouging out our own eyeballs, perhaps?"
Lae'zel,Yet I do not recommend Shadowheart seek it again.
Lae'zel,The next resolution may not end in her favour.
Lae'zel,I will not be bearing the burden of the half-elf's deceit.
Lae'zel,She was the source of strife; I was the end of it.
Lae'zel,I suggest you turn your eye of judgement to her.
Lae'zel,"Mm - yes, I'm sure you believe that."
Lae'zel,"Reality would not reflect your ego, I'm afraid."
Lae'zel,I said we no longer quarreled. I have not said we must trust her.
Lae'zel,"Watch her with keen eyes. One wrong move, and we act."
Lae'zel,Or just dispose of the foul thing.
Lae'zel,Clever. I'd congratulate you if I could bear the sight of you.
Lae'zel,It was an observation. Not a compliment.
Lae'zel,Anything more?
Lae'zel,Bah - perhaps you'd find forgiveness in a fiery death. But I can't help but wonder why you'd want it at all.
Lae'zel,Talk. I'm listening.
Lae'zel,I want to taste you. Perhaps tonight. Perhaps later. But I want it all the same.
Lae'zel,I won't be your girlfriend. But I will be your lay.
Lae'zel,"Yes, or no."
Lae'zel,"Perhaps one night soon, I will come to your bunk and take what is mine."
Lae'zel,Until that night comes - I shall keep enjoying your scent.
Lae'zel,"Your loss, I fear. "
Lae'zel,Isn't it obvious?
Lae'zel,"One day soon, you will wonder how my lips might have tasted, how my fingers on your skin might have felt."
Lae'zel,"'Yuck', is it?"
Lae'zel,I don't pay compliments. I only say what is true.
Lae'zel,You've proven me wrong at every turn. You are efficient. Dominant. Courageous.
Lae'zel,I hadn't thought myself so transparent.
Lae'zel,Well - you'd be a succulent meal. I would like to have gorged.
Lae'zel,But you've been prodded and picked over like a suckling boar. I prefer fresher meat.
Lae'zel,And you will wish you could return to this lost moment.
Lae'zel,"So you noticed. Yes, you caught my eye. You've caught someone else's, too."
Lae'zel,"When I come near, your odour alone is enough to make my neck sweat and my hairs stand on end."
Lae'zel,"I swear, you would tear the horns off one dragon for plunging into another."
Lae'zel,Well chosen. What good is a warrior who's exiled from battle?
Lae'zel,"Confirmed. Until then, I remain at the ready."
Lae'zel,A practical choice.
Lae'zel,As you say. Do not keep me waiting.
Lae'zel,"We travel west. We may yet witness signs of a crèche, if you are not so busy ignoring me."
Lae'zel,I had but one request: to speak to Zorru. And you have made a mockery of it.
Lae'zel,"You've gained my respect, and more still, my yearning."
Lae'zel,I have a confession.
Lae'zel,"I thought you witless, gutless, unimpressively bland."
Lae'zel,"Now, well - you've earned my respect, and more still. You've proven your wits. You are efficient and dominant, in and out of battle."
Lae'zel,"You've proven your courage. I swear, you would tear the horns off one dragon to plunge into another."
Lae'zel,And you're hardly bland. Your scent alone is enough to make my neck sweat and my hairs stand on end.
Lae'zel,Yes. All that is true. I am cold as the Sea of Night -
Lae'zel,- but you have stoked fires I didn't know I possessed.
Lae'zel,I was too hasty to judge you.
Lae'zel,"The texts are enciphered, but there's a Commonspeech translation beneath, carved in a different hand."
Lae'zel,It's a story about - about Orpheus.
Lae'zel,A myth-weaver. This man has no respect for truth.
Lae'zel,"'The Prince of the Comet, Part Two.'"
Lae'zel,"'The Prince of the Comet, Orpheus himself, led his honour guard into battle. Their red dragons bellowed with righteous anger, and the heavens erupted.'"
Lae'zel,"'When the ash had cleared, beloved Orpheus was gone.'"
Lae'zel,"So says the text. Orpheus was gone, yes. But most certainly not dead."
Lae'zel,"So says the text. Orpheus was gone, yes. But of course, he wasn't dead - not yet."
Lae'zel,You speak heresy.
Lae'zel,The queen would take even a child's head for so much as whispering this rubbish.
Lae'zel,"A dangerous one. Lies have a way of spreading, until they cannot be discerned from the truth."
Lae'zel,Kith'rak Voss and his red dragon slayed the fell prince. You could no more resurrect him than you could glue together the pile of ashes he became.
Lae'zel,"Traitor he may be, but even I wouldn't doubt Voss' greatest triumph."
Lae'zel,My varsh taught that the silver bells of Vlaakith's court still ring out before every hunt in celebration of the prince's defeat.
Lae'zel,"Let judgement be cast. Spill blood after, if you must."
Lae'zel,Tiamat's emissary. It was he who carried word that Mother Gith had negotiated the gift of the dragons -
Lae'zel,- and that Vlaakith the First would preside as queen of the githyanki.
Lae'zel,It is not just improbable - it is impossible.
Lae'zel,This Zorru has encountered githyanki. I must find and question him.
Lae'zel,"The queen would take that foolish child's head for so much as whispering this rubbish, were it to reach her ears."
Lae'zel,"A ludicrous one, at that. Vlaakith seized the empire from my peoples' very mother?"
Lae'zel,Another part of the Orpheus tale. This one has been translated to Common.
Lae'zel,Another part of the Orpheus tale. It reads as follows:
Lae'zel,"The texts are enciphered, but I've solved the pattern. It's a story. About - about Orpheus."
Lae'zel,Well - enough conjecture. I'm done with the matter.
Lae'zel,"Yes. Famed - and long dead, the fool traitor."
Lae'zel,"This text is heresy. I can hardly bear to read it, let alone speak it."
Lae'zel,Very well. I will read it to you.
Lae'zel,As unthinkable as the greatest living knight turning on his queen...
Lae'zel,"Well - enough conjecture. I did what you asked, so let's be done with it."
Lae'zel,She did nothing of the sort.
Lae'zel,"Thank your good fortunes I'm a tolerant woman, or I'd have sliced off a few toes for suggesting it."
Lae'zel,And so it is. A fabrication.
Lae'zel,"A clever one, too, to masquerade as an ancient history. How many such stories could there be. And how many minds have been warped by them?"
Lae'zel,A rational choice. We mustn't stray from our path.
Lae'zel,Bah. We've no time to offer aid to every whimpering pup.
Lae'zel,Are you sure that's the best course of action?
Lae'zel,"My allies do so love to keep simmering secrets. Or explosive, in your case."
Lae'zel,Very well. I'll keep watch until you call on me.
Lae'zel,Then that's where I will stay.
Lae'zel,I know how I'd choose.
Lae'zel,Lord Bhaal's Chosen. You must think yourself mighty for it.
Lae'zel,Yet you were already mighty. And you would have been mightier still if you'd defied him and your 'urges'.
Lae'zel,Let's.
Lae'zel,"I'll consider it if I am in need of relief. Until then, I'll enjoy watching you squirm from the anticipation of it."
Lae'zel,"Perhaps, if I am in need of relief. Until then, I'll enjoy watching you squirm from the anticipation of it."
Lae'zel,"One day, perhaps soon, Bhaal will demand your fealty. You'll either muster the strength to defy him - or you will succumb."
Lae'zel,"Would I approve if you coupled with Halsin, you mean."
Lae'zel,"But I have laid my claim. Give yourself to him, and you break our bond."
Lae'zel,Yes. 'Hypothetical'.
Lae'zel,"'Hypothetically', were you to give yourself to him, you would be breaking our bond."
Lae'zel,So you've made a choice. Or maybe you'll pretend Minthara made it for you.
Lae'zel,Not that I hadn't thought about it. You were a better lay than I'd expected.
Lae'zel,"But I've gone off the idea. We've an elder brain to destroy, and cannot risk unneeded distraction."
Lae'zel,"Undoubtedly. Arms like tree trunks, chest broad as an ocean."
Lae'zel,I though as much. I suppose I should be flattered.
Lae'zel,"I'm not surprised. You've become death incarnate. Mighty, yes. And altogether unpredictable and intractable."
Lae'zel,"Yes. And owing to your dubious compulsions, we've lost crucial allies."
Lae'zel,"Ceremophosis takes all of you - mind, body, soul. An ordinary tadpole would eat at your memories until they were lost to the void."
Lae'zel,But our tadpoles are far from ordinary. I wonder if another factor's in play.
Lae'zel,Many a good warrior savours the scent of blood in the air. There's no shame in a capricious murder now and again.
Lae'zel,"Too many, though, and you waste energy and dull your weapon."
Lae'zel,"My suggestion: attack with purpose, and savour your kills. And if the urge proves too much, well, I'm sure we can find you a goblin or two to carve up."
Lae'zel,I'll tell you what I think anyway:
Lae'zel,You are powerful. But not insightful.
Lae'zel,"I won't miss Alfira. But I won't stand for chaos. Govern your hunger, before it governs you."
Lae'zel,Precisely the way I meant to avoid.
Lae'zel,"You'll think of no better, I assure you."
Lae'zel,You won't. 
Lae'zel,"I will try to help you resist. But spill a single drop of my blood, and yours will flow in a gusher."
Lae'zel,A fitting name. But have you become the Slayer - or has a Slayer merely found a host too weak to evict it?
Lae'zel,"I shouldn't need to say it, but - be careful who you take as an ally. Especially when that ally's taken residence inside you."
Lae'zel,Send her to the grove. Better to face them on familiar ground.
Lae'zel,"One couldn't, and one shouldn't."
Lae'zel,Do as you like. The loss is not so much mine as yours.
Lae'zel,You made it abundantly clear.
Lae'zel,"Quick of foot, this one, to avoid githyanki hunters."
Lae'zel,"Do you not feel the cold where once there was heat? The void, where your soul once resided?"
Lae'zel,The elder brain could be the harbinger of the Grand Design and the doom of the githyanki.
Lae'zel,I have no words...
Lae'zel,It's as I feared. You've lost your senses.
Lae'zel,The endtime of the sixteen planes will be upon us. And the Astral would be the first to fall.
Lae'zel,My faith in Vlaakith will guide me and my own might will sustain me. I have no need of this depraved power.
Lae'zel,Yisk Gith'ka tavki krash'ht.
Lae'zel,Bah. I will serve at no ruler's side but my queen's.
Lae'zel,I know. And I won't.
Lae'zel,There will be ice where once there was fire. There will be a void where our souls once resided.
Lae'zel,You've no room. Dismiss your weakest warrior.
Lae'zel,It is done.
Lae'zel,Camp? Are you certain?
Lae'zel,Vlaakith'ka sivim hrath krash'ht.
Lae'zel,My own might will sustain me. I have no need of this depraved power.
Lae'zel,"It won't hear my screams, it won't care if I beg. I will be remade in its image."
Lae'zel,"A dead elf? The druid Halsin, most certainly."
Lae'zel,"Of course you have. If I'm in the mood for a lay, I'll know who to call on."
Lae'zel,"Save the druid if you must. If we spill goblin blood on the way, all the better."
Lae'zel,"Mark my words, this power would be no blessing, but a curse."
Lae'zel,"You might as well ask me to gouge out my eyes for the promise of sight, or slice off my tongue for the promise of taste."
Lae'zel,The mere suggestion is an insult.
Lae'zel,"Perhaps you... no, that's absurd."
Lae'zel,"When the tadpole has stretched to every pore and slithered through every vein, what am I to do then? "
Lae'zel,You - you might be right.
Lae'zel,"The tadpole is perhaps not just a curse, but a weapon I can twist and mould to my advantage."
Lae'zel,Very well. I will swallow my disgust and avail myself of the parasite's powers.
Lae'zel,You're wasting your time and mine. The answer is 'no'. 
Lae'zel,Let's do just that.
Lae'zel,"And when the tadpole has stretched to every pore and slithered through every vein, what then? "
Lae'zel,The dead elf must be Halsin. As much help to us now as he would be alive.
Lae'zel,He won't be any help now. Not that he would have been much help before.
Lae'zel,A cursed book? How obvious. Whoever opens it deserves the fate that befalls them.
Lae'zel,A question that burns in my belly day and night.
Lae'zel,But I won't give you love.
Lae'zel,"'Next'? We seek purification. I might even lay you again, should my whims so take me."
Lae'zel,"You made an incredible sacrifice - for me, for our people, for the Prince of the Comet."
Lae'zel,But I am more than my instinct.
Lae'zel,My instinct is to flay you where you stand.
Lae'zel,"No. First, the Netherbrain. Once it is fallen, we'll speak of the future beyond."
Lae'zel,The brain is near. Let it be your one and only focus.
Lae'zel,Come. Let this day be the Netherbrain's last!
Lae'zel,"You made an incredible sacrifice - for me, for my people, for the Prince of the Comet."
Lae'zel,"Ah, a most welcome sight."
Lae'zel,"Karlach - if death is soon to take you, make ever moment as rich as the last."
Lae'zel,"If death is soon to take Karlach, she should make ever moment as rich as the last."
Lae'zel,"Fight viciously, roar loudly, step boldly. Make yourself known."
Lae'zel,"Fight viciously, roar loudly, step boldly. She must make herself known."
Lae'zel,"The hammer is ours, the devil is snuffed out. Our power is undeniable!"
Lae'zel,Blade of Avernus - you will force all devilkind to tremble before you. The Hells have much to fear.
Lae'zel,"Shadowheart's search is concluded. The Nightsinger may inflict pain upon her, but never her will."
Lae'zel,Wyll shall force all devilkind to tremble before him. The Hells have much to fear.
Lae'zel,The Prince of the Comet is fallen - and so I blaze a path to victory in his name.
Lae'zel,A warrior? Hardly. A single lemure is worth less than a maggot. Only in swarms are they ever useful.
Lae'zel,As necessary.
Lae'zel,Strength in partnership.
Lae'zel,Success. As expected.
Lae'zel,Healing.
Lae'zel,I will decide after that where my path should lead.
Lae'zel,But I made my promise. We will slay the Netherbrain and end the illithid Grand Design.
Lae'zel,"Your search is concluded. The Nightsinger may inflict pain upon you, but never her will."
Lae'zel,"By every right, I should cut off your limbs one by one and leave you to your screams."
Lae'zel,"You had a choice. And you took my prince from me, from his people."
Lae'zel,"You took my prince from me, from his people."
Lae'zel,My prince - may your mother forgive me. And may the githyanki people one day know the freedom they so richly deserve.
Lae'zel,Go - to Orpheus' prison.
Lae'zel,Our moment of triumph draws closer. Our enemies will paint us with bruises - and we will wear them with pride.
Lae'zel,"I am. With the Prince of the Comet at our side, we will wreck the Netherbrain and its Grand Design."
Lae'zel,You took our freedom.
Lae'zel,"Good to have you back with us. Thanks to you, my Common vocabulary has grown considerably."
Lae'zel,"Good to have the wizard back with us. Thanks to him, my Common vocabulary has grown considerably."
Lae'zel,"Fated to madness, or so Bhaal claims. Believe it, and it will surely come to pass. Which is why you must challenge it."
Lae'zel,"You're suffering. You might be surprised, but - it pains me to see."
Lae'zel,We've returned to the Prism - but with no means to free Orpheus.
Lae'zel,"Shadowheart suffers. You might be surprised, but - it pains me to see."
Lae'zel,Now - what would you ask of me?
Lae'zel,"I had all but lost faith in you, Shadowheart. It takes a stout will to prove me wrong. Well done."
Lae'zel,Punished? Then Florrick's been captured. Or worse.
Lae'zel,Viconia sought that which she could never have controlled. Her failure was written from the start.
Lae'zel,The real Ravengard's still in there - and he wants out.
Lae'zel,A perfect circle. You began as the Coast's champion; it's right you should remain as such.
Lae'zel,A perfect circle. Wyll began as the Coast's champion; it's right he should remain as such.
Lae'zel,The Hells have taken their prize - and the frontiers have lost their Blade.
Lae'zel,I will be watching closely for what you do next.
Lae'zel,"The Blade of Frontiers in the guise of a devil. I'd remark on the irony, but I'd hate to waste the breath."
Lae'zel,Still - it took guts to defy that petty patron of yours. The Blade's sting is real.
Lae'zel,I had all but lost faith in the so-called Sharran. It takes a stout will to prove me wrong.
Lae'zel,Are our people doomed to eternally suffer at the hands of the lich queen Vlaakith?
Lae'zel,Are my people doomed to eternally suffer at the hands of the lich queen Vlaakith?
Lae'zel,"The Emperor deserves no more than a blade in its belly. But you are right, we must explore every option -"
Lae'zel,"Madness could still take you. But you'd go honourably, fighting 'til the very last."
Lae'zel,"'Githyanki.' The word means, quite literally, 'Gith's children'."
Lae'zel,But I have never known 'family' the way you do. My so-called 'cousins' are simply spawn hatched from the same clutch.
Lae'zel,But I have never known 'family' the way Jaheira knows it. My so-called 'cousins' are simply spawn hatched from the same clutch.
Lae'zel,"I will never know who laid the egg I hatched from, and until I met your family, I never thought to wonder..."
Lae'zel,"I will never know who laid the egg I hatched from, and until I met Jaheira's family, I never thought to wonder..."
Lae'zel,Well - enough brooding. What did you need?
Lae'zel,Do not dwell on Shadowheart's fate. We are equally mighty without her.
Lae'zel,"Astarion proved himself no less maniacal than his master. His death was a favour - to him, to us, and to the city."
Lae'zel,Good riddance to Ketheric Thorm. We will see that his allies suffer the same fate.
Lae'zel,You succumbed to your power-lust. A githyanki would have known better.
Lae'zel,To seek power for personal glory alone is a farce. A shame you can't see it.
Lae'zel,"Orpheus will die by my hand. So I have spoken, so it is recorded in slate."
Lae'zel,We must speak to the Emperor - there might be another way to free the prince.
Lae'zel,"No, no - I won't abandon the Great Mother's only son."
Lae'zel,Keeping you sharp.
Lae'zel,Still - it took guts to defy that petty patron of his. The Blade's sting is real.
Lae'zel,Built for battle!
Lae'zel,You have my support!
Lae'zel,As I was taught.
Lae'zel,I know what to do.
Lae'zel,Undetected.
Lae'zel,In Vlaakith's eyes only.
Lae'zel,"Fortunate for him, slaying monstrous fanatics is a pastime of ours."
Lae'zel,"Bhaalspawn? I'm not surprised. You've become death incarnate. Mighty, yes. And altogether unpredictable and intractable."
Lae'zel,The right decision.
Lae'zel,Hta'lak k'rith ma'har! 
Lae'zel,By Gith's eternal grace...
Lae'zel,Tell me why I should not cut off your limbs one by one and leave you to your screams.
Lae'zel,Light steps.
Lae'zel,"Unheard, unseen."
Lae'zel,Not one false move.
Lae'zel,I shouldn't linger.
Lae'zel,We will end the Grand Design. And then we will go our separate ways.
Lae'zel,Another stride toward fate.
Lae'zel,Not a single act wasted.
Lae'zel,You have my attention!
Lae'zel,Out of the shadows.<br>
Lae'zel,Out of the shadows.
Lae'zel,The end comes.
Lae'zel,"Your pain, my pleasure."
Lae'zel,A close alliance.
Lae'zel,Communication is key.
Lae'zel,It is not over!
Lae'zel,Matters need attending.
Lae'zel,Better be worth it.
Lae'zel,Help underway.
Lae'zel,My skill is required.
Lae'zel,An unfortunate plight.
Lae'zel,Might made manifest!
Lae'zel,Rise and fight!
Lae'zel,At my mercy.
Lae'zel,Help underway!
Lae'zel,I will assist!
Lae'zel,"Warrior, champion, saviour!"
Lae'zel,Hush already.
Lae'zel,There is no wisdom in madness.
Lae'zel,Is perfection too much to ask?
Lae'zel,There is but one way. Vlaakith.
Lae'zel,Taking a look!
Lae'zel,Open up!
Lae'zel,"Speak, and listen."
Lae'zel,Weapons high. Standards higher.
Lae'zel,Aid me!
Lae'zel,Ungh...
Lae'zel,I won't die like this...
Lae'zel,Not like this.
Lae'zel,Your hand. Now!
Lae'zel,Help is near.
Lae'zel,Pride is a virtue.
Lae'zel,Stay calm - I'm coming.
Lae'zel,I won't keep you waiting.
Lae'zel,A good opportunity.
Lae'zel,Still in shadow.
Lae'zel,Staying out of sight.
Lae'zel,Keeping low.
Lae'zel,Ready for anything.
Lae'zel,"With every breath, a purpose."
Lae'zel,My patience wanes.
Lae'zel,In my best interest.
Lae'zel,Without fail!
Lae'zel,Eager for battle.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith's will be done.
Lae'zel,"Action, not reaction."
Lae'zel,Assume nothing.
Lae'zel,Indolence breeds madness.
Lae'zel,Enough waiting. I crave blood.
Lae'zel,Helping myself.
Lae'zel,Stand firm!
Lae'zel,Let us cheat death.
Lae'zel,A shivering child.
Lae'zel,Mystra must be pleased with Gale - I can sense the Weave's threads winding about him.
Lae'zel,A perfect sanctum for rats - the literal and metaphorical sort.
Lae'zel,Astarion was a useful weapon in our arsenal. His loss will require some adaptations.
Lae'zel,"The drider's light protects us. Don't wander off, unless you want to be devoured by shadow."
Lae'zel,Desperation is the obverse of wisdom. Zevlor was always destined to fail his people - and to fail us.
Lae'zel,"I can't see how this dark lantern of yours will help us. Time will tell if that is my failure, or yours."
Lae'zel,"I can't see how this dark lantern of Gale's will help us. Time will tell if that is my failure, or his."
Lae'zel,"He should give it to her and be done with it, or his lust for power might well consume him."
Lae'zel,Minsc is the Stone Lord? Jaheira's friend doesn't sound so friendly after all.
Lae'zel,"Voracious, aren't we? Well, suck up all the magic you need, as long as you don't snack on a githyanki silver sword."
Lae'zel,"Cities beneath cities, layers below layers. Faerûn is a richer land than I'd imagined."
Lae'zel,An underwater prison - a shrewd idea. Gortash was nothing if not a meticulous schemer.
Lae'zel,You pale cheeks are a bit pinker than before. You look positively - alive.
Lae'zel,Astarion's pale cheeks are a bit pinker than before. He looks positively - alive.
Lae'zel,"But whatever our fates, we should accept them. Not everyone is meant to live longer than the stars."
Lae'zel,"Halsin's proved himself a fine ally already. He'll be useful in battle, If those tree-trunk arms are an indication."
Lae'zel,"The Mother of All Magic, they say. Let us hope Mystra brings you good fortunes."
Lae'zel,I much prefer straightforward condescension - it leaves no chance of being misunderstood.
Lae'zel,Another chill. Strange.
Lae'zel,I do not trust Mystra to do right with the crown. But you are wise to give it to her.
Lae'zel,"Every githyanki has held a sword by age six, and claims their first kill by age ten."
Lae'zel,Yet these tieflings claim barely a single warrior among them. It's a wonder they've survived even this long.
Lae'zel,"We made short work of those who would hunt you, Astarion."
Lae'zel,We made short work of those who would hunt Astarion.
Lae'zel,"But if your new status proves a liability, I won't hesitate to strike you down."
Lae'zel,Curious.
Lae'zel,"But if his new status proves a liability, I won't hesitate to strike him down."
Lae'zel,You were no true child of Shar - you were her captive. Vengeance must be yours.
Lae'zel,Shadowheart was no true child of Shar - merely a captive. She must have her vengeance.
Lae'zel,Mizora positively drips with passive-aggressive condescension.
Lae'zel,I won't abide another word of this heresy.
Lae'zel,Your apology means nothing to me.
Lae'zel,There it is again. Such an odd sensation.
Lae'zel,Orin thinks Minthara's abduction is an ultimatum to kill Gortash.
Lae'zel,"The Mother of All Magic, they say. Let us hope Mystra brings Gale good fortunes."
Lae'zel,Gale's lust for power is... concerning.
Lae'zel,I do not trust Mystra to do right with the crown. But I am quite sure I trust him even less.
Lae'zel,Is this to be my penance? Is this heart of stone doomed to shatter?
Lae'zel,"I followed your path. What good, this heart of stone, for it to be shattered?"
Lae'zel,Silence.
Lae'zel,I must think.
Lae'zel,"No, it can't be. All I have given you - my might, my trust - and you left me here to idle for you to deny my venerated queen?"
Lae'zel,"Fine. Leave me to my thoughts, and I'll leave you to yours."
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith. Vlaakith! I have wielded your fury as a blade, roared your wrath as a dragon!"
Lae'zel,"And this time, you'd be wise to take me with you."
Lae'zel,"Had I been there, the queen would have known my faith. I would have seen her bidding done!"
Lae'zel,"I have wielded Vlaakith's fury as a blade, roared her wrath as a dragon - and you have rendered it all for naught."
Lae'zel,"Thank Mother Gith, the psionic projection is holding."
Lae'zel,"I am Lae'zel of K'liir. And tonight, this is where I belong."
Lae'zel,Revelry and community on the eve of revolution. Magnificent.
Lae'zel,"This... feeling. Comfort, warmth. I don't understand it, but I will accept it."
Lae'zel,Tell me what happened inside the artefact. Leave nothing out.
Lae'zel,"This was a cruel fate. No matter our differences, she deserved better from us."
Lae'zel,"Shadowheart was - well, she and I - *sigh*."
Lae'zel,"Gale is positively voracious. Well - let him suck up all the magic he needs, as long as he doesn't snack on a githyanki silver sword."
Lae'zel,He must give it to her when the time comes. He will find no redemption or honour in godhood - only the burden of a million empty souls looking for a saviour he can never be.
Lae'zel,A devil will come for her due. Mizora is no different.
Lae'zel,"Whatever it is she comes to offer, whatever choice you make, someone will suffer. Count on it."
Lae'zel,"Whatever it is she comes to offer, whatever choice Wyll makes, someone will suffer. Count on it."
Lae'zel,"Our camp houses an impostor, then. Say nothing, trust no one. Not even me."
Lae'zel,Good thing for Wyll that Karlach called a truce. A tiefling that mighty would shred him to pieces and burn the remains.
Lae'zel,Now - what did you need?
Lae'zel,I hope we're not finished with our current labours before Minthara drops her egg. War is the perfect nursery for a child.
Lae'zel,"Owing to your dubious compulsions, we've lost crucial allies."
Lae'zel,You may be powerful. But you are not insightful.
Lae'zel,I was no friend to Alfira - but there was no sense in killing her. I'll be watching everyone in this camp like a hawk.
Lae'zel,Orin's dead. Which means we have taken one more step closer to slaughtering the fetid elder brain.
Lae'zel,"The curse is broken and the shadows are lifting. In time, these lands will heal."
Lae'zel,The imperious elf's got the red eyes and pale skin of a wight.
Lae'zel,And I'm not convinced he's any more trustworthy.
Lae'zel,An underwater prison - a shrewd idea. Gortash is nothing if not a meticulous schemer.
Lae'zel,"Mystra must be pleased with you, Gale - I can sense the Weave's threads winding about you."
Lae'zel,"So be it. But the truth will out, Gale. Some secrets can't go untold forever."
Lae'zel,"Suck up all the magic you need, Gale, provided you don't go snacking on a githyanki silver sword. But I'd care to know the reason for it."
Lae'zel,"...or an ordinary hamster. Either way, I'm not about to go nibbling on him."
Lae'zel,"I've never heard of a miniature version, let alone a conversant one. Which means Boo is either a rare specimen..."
Lae'zel,"It's a long way to K'liir. As for Boo, I've never heard of a miniature giant space hamster, let alone a conversant one. Which means Boo is either a rare specimen..."
Lae'zel,"...or an ordinary hamster. Not fit for eating, either way."
Lae'zel,So you've an explosive buried in you? My allies do so love to keep simmering secrets.
Lae'zel,"Near as I can tell, Mystra demands Gale's faith - but holds no faith in him."
Lae'zel,"Besides, I've never heard of a miniature version, let alone a conversant one. Which means Boo is either a rare specimen..."
Lae'zel,Why else would she demand Gale sacrifice himself and perhaps so many others?
Lae'zel,"Let there be no doubt. We will take the hammer, and we will free Orpheus."
Lae'zel,"Speak, devil. We're listening."
Lae'zel,I don't want to free him. I want to kill him.
Lae'zel,I want nothing more.
Lae'zel,"But first, we must attend to the captive prince."
Lae'zel,The Netherbrain believes it will rise victorious. But it could never predict the extent of our might and the strength of our bond.
Lae'zel,Does she not think he can destroy the Absolute with his own immense talents? Does she not know the mighty company that he keeps?
Lae'zel,"Such blazing wonder, to behold the sky swarming with red dragons. Listen close, and you can almost hear them roaring Queen Vlaakith's blessed name."
Lae'zel,And addle his brain even further? I wouldn't dream of it.
Lae'zel,"Very. But I've never heard of a miniature version, let alone a conversant one. Which means Boo is either a rare specimen..."
Lae'zel,"The drow is unpredictable, uncompromising. I respect her almost as much as I distrust her."
Lae'zel,"If 'get out' not clear enough for you, child, perhaps a flash of my weapon will get the message across. "
Lae'zel,You are worried about this killing urge. I can see it.
Lae'zel,"Isn't it glorious? Your fury is a wonder to behold, Karlach."
Lae'zel,"The Prince of the Comet will soar, and the age of Vlaakith will be ended!"
Lae'zel,Isn't it glorious? Karlach's fury is a wonder to behold.
Lae'zel,...or an ordinary hamster.
Lae'zel,The wizard was a useful find. Let's hope he's as powerful as he is verbose.
Lae'zel,To seek power for personal glory alone is a farce. You were wise to see it.
Lae'zel,"Enough whinging, already. You should be drunk on the kill, not drowning us in crocodile tears."
Lae'zel,"It was unsightly, watching you slay the daughter of Selûne. I didn't think you would sink so low."
Lae'zel,"It was unsightly, watching Shadowheart slay the daughter of Selûne. I didn't think she would sink so low."
Lae'zel,"Speak, and let's be done with it."
Lae'zel,"On Crèche K'liir, giant space hamsters are a staple food. Their hocks are quite scrumptious - if a bit fatty."
Lae'zel,You chose right. And any well-trained githyanki would have chosen the same.
Lae'zel,What are you playing at? I will find a way yet to free the prince. This was my promise!
Lae'zel,"Voss, friend to the Comet."
Lae'zel,"Such blazing wonder - the sky swarming with red dragons. They may roar Vlaakith's name, but I can't deny their beauty."
Lae'zel,She still has every chance to prove me wrong.
Lae'zel,"This place is... enlightening. My own crèche, K'liir, is remote and sunless, cloaked in the silence of wildspace."
Lae'zel,"Should I ever take to the Astral Plane, I'll have no need of scrolls to secure my immortality."
Lae'zel,"Still, it is becoming of a mortal to accept their fate, as Jaheira does. Not everyone is meant to live longer than the stars."
Lae'zel,No warrior of worth would resist such tantalising prey.
Lae'zel,"The Dread Lord craves victims. I say, let him starve."
Lae'zel,It seems Jaheira's devotion to Minsc was stronger than her devotion to defeating the brain - and saving her city.
Lae'zel,Orin be damned - her bloody fingerprints are all over this city.
Lae'zel,'Duke Wyll Ravengard.' A moniker justly earned.
Lae'zel,'Duke Wyll Ravengard.' A moniker Wyll shall justly earn.
Lae'zel,"The idealist do-gooder, the benevolent burden."
Lae'zel,"Roughly translated: 'idealist do-gooder'. Or better yet, 'benevolent burden'."
Lae'zel,His confidence is an asset. His pursuit of valour? Not so much.
Lae'zel,"My my, aren't we feeling voracious?"
Lae'zel,So Gale carries an explosive inside him? My allies do so love to keep simmering secrets.
Lae'zel,Gortash stinks no more as a corpse than he did as Bane's chosen. We've done well.
Lae'zel,Mark my word: The half-elf's an abyss of lies and secrets. 'Shadowheart' indeed.
Lae'zel,"The House is excessive, overwrought, and ever-so-seedy - a perfect reflection of its owner."
Lae'zel,"Such blazing wonder, to stand together and behold the sky swarming with red dragons. Listen close, and you can almost hear them roaring Queen Vlaakith's blessed name."
Lae'zel,Bah - perhaps he'd find forgiveness in a fiery death. But I can't help but wonder why he'd want it at all.
Lae'zel,"Cazador's minions have picked up our trail. For your sake, I hope this was the last of them."
Lae'zel,"Cazador's minions have picked up our trail. For Astarion's sake, I hope this was the last of them."
Lae'zel,"Can you feel it - that ache in your skull, that silent scream? The brain wants us for its puppets."
Lae'zel,"The light here warms my skin, cleanses my lungs. A welcome change from the surrounding shadow."
Lae'zel,Make your choice. Endure the consequences.
Lae'zel,Illusions abound in this place. Trust neither your eyes nor your ears.
Lae'zel,Orin thinks this abduction is some sort of... ultimatum to kill Gortash.
Lae'zel,Thorm's on the run. Quickly - we must follow!
Lae'zel,"I feel... odd. My memories feel more like dreams, or stories I've half-overheard."
Lae'zel,"With the Nightsong at our side, we will crush Ketheric quickly."
Lae'zel,"I'm impressed, Shadowheart. You chose rightly and courageously."
Lae'zel,I'm impressed. Shadowheart chose rightly and courageously.
Lae'zel,I sought to reach a githyanki crèche and be rid of these tadpoles. Now we stalk forgotten lands haunted by darkness.
Lae'zel,"The truth according to Gale: the abridged edition. Now, care to tell me the details, or will you be leaving me to guess?"
Lae'zel,"Up, now. Your moment's over."
Lae'zel,Lash'a'kla!
Lae'zel,The time has come.
Lae'zel,Hurry. We must explore the crèche - purification awaits.
Lae'zel,We must set out for a crèche - purification awaits.
Lae'zel,Then we know our destination. Onward.
Lae'zel,Yes - I must read it at once. Purification may be at hand!
Lae'zel,"A slate? A map to the nearest crèche, perhaps."
Lae'zel,You survived an encounter with githyanki? Extraordinary. They must have suffered prior injury...
Lae'zel,"You still survive. An impressive feat, given the visitor lodged in your head."
Lae'zel,They attacked their own kin? This is most extraordinary.
Lae'zel,You angered githyanki? You are lucky your heart still beats.
Lae'zel,"Onward, then - purification awaits us."
Lae'zel,Then we mustn't delay. Onward - purification awaits us.
Lae'zel,A red dragon? Then githyanki are near! Onward - purification awaits us.
Lae'zel,We scout the roads and scan the skies for children of Gith. They will lead us to a crèche.
Lae'zel,"A crèche is near - we must seek signs of it. Forward, through the pass."
Lae'zel,Bah. A cure must be our chief concern. Onward - purification awaits us.
Lae'zel,A crèche is near - we must seek signs of it. Search these corpses for a map.
Lae'zel,"The githyanki of the Sword Coast have a cure in their crèche, which I believe to be near. It's time you lend me your skills. Together, we can finally be cleansed."
Lae'zel,"Good - you've come to your senses. Come, to the crèche. Let us be cleansed of our tadpoles."
Lae'zel,"The githyanki of the Sword Coast have a cure in their crèche, which I believe to be near. Lend me your skills, and let us be cleansed together."
Lae'zel,You. I know you -
Lae'zel,Never mind. Come with me - I must enter the Prism. Something awaits there. Something precious to Vlaakith.
Lae'zel,I'll wait. But I won't wait long.
Lae'zel,"Come, then. Every moment counts."
Lae'zel,You will need to make room. See that it happens.
Lae'zel,Hurry. We must enter the Prism.
Lae'zel,It's not your choice to make. Let me speak with your leader.
Lae'zel,As I said: no.
Lae'zel,"Now let's move, before this discussion turns maudlin."
Lae'zel,"I'm glad you came back, all right?"
Lae'zel,"Never mind. Come with me, and let us be purified."
Lae'zel,Never mind. Come with me - I must enter the Prism. Vlaakith commanded it.
Lae'zel,"So you've seen reason. Truth be told, I'm -"
Lae'zel,I - well. Mm.
Lae'zel,"Enough. A crèche is near - we must seek signs of it. Forward, through the pass."
Lae'zel,Enough. A crèche is near - we must seek signs of it. Search these corpses for a map.
Lae'zel,"We must scout the roads and scan the skies for children of Gith. They will lead us to a crèche. There, we will be purified."
Lae'zel,"You've a sharp tongue, elf. Would that your mind proved its equal."
Lae'zel,"There, we will be purified."
Lae'zel,Come. We scout the roads and scan the skies for children of Gith. They will lead us to a crèche.
Lae'zel,The horned hunters mentioned a sighting - one among them has seen my kind.
Lae'zel,The horned hunters mentioned a sighting - one among them has seen our kind.
Lae'zel,"We scout the roads and scan the skies for children of Gith. They will lead us to a crèche. There, we will be purified."
Lae'zel,Come. The horned ones mentioned a camp. One there - this Zorru - has seen githyanki.
Lae'zel,I will be at your camp. Do not keep me waiting.
Lae'zel,You are full up. Dismiss your weakest warrior.
Lae'zel,You do not have the authority. Defer to your leader.
Lae'zel,Come. We find this Zorru. And we ask where he has seen our kin.
Lae'zel,This means a crèche is near.
Lae'zel,The horned ones mentioned a camp. One there - this Zorru - has seen githyanki.
Lae'zel,The cure I offer will suffice as thanks.
Lae'zel,Very well. But heed my words.
Lae'zel,A crèche must be near. We will ask this Zorru where he has seen my kin.
Lae'zel,Such tiring mediocrity.
Lae'zel,Chk.
Lae'zel,I will await word at your camp.
Lae'zel,A crèche is near - we must seek signs of it. Only there can we be purified.
Lae'zel,"By covenant, I can say no more."
Lae'zel,"By Vlaakith's covenant, I know little more."
Lae'zel,I do not yet know - we will seek it together. Protocol is clear:
Lae'zel,Come - our search begins. We've no time to waste.
Lae'zel,"Together, we must find a crèche: my people possess the cure for this infection."
Lae'zel,"You will join me. Together, we must find a crèche: our people possess the cure for this infection."
Lae'zel,"The longer the parasite lives, the more of us it consumes. "
Lae'zel,I live. Vlaakith blesses me once more!
Lae'zel,"Our paths cross again, kin. I might call it fate, if I believed in it."
Lae'zel,Shka'keth!
Lae'zel,Well?
Lae'zel,"If you wish to be rid of the tadpole, you must either be purified - or beheaded."
Lae'zel,I know my teachings. There are no half measures. 
Lae'zel,"So says our queen's teachings, and so it must be."
Lae'zel,You may as well suggest a wyvern bow to worms.
Lae'zel,"So says my queen's teachings, and so it must be."
Lae'zel,"Nestled here in the pass, quite possibly."
Lae'zel,You would deny yourself further pleasure?
Lae'zel,"Have it your way. We depart come dawn, and no later."
Lae'zel,And you will take your rest alone.
Lae'zel,You are a child of Gith. You train relentlessly. You know your body inside and out.
Lae'zel,Gith train relentlessly. We know our bodies inside and out.
Lae'zel,It is time you knew mine.
Lae'zel,Tell me.
Lae'zel,'The Blade of Frontiers.' One might think you finished where you started.
Lae'zel,I lead. You follow.
Lae'zel,So you think. Let's see if you're right.
Lae'zel,Rest well. We will convene at dawn.
Lae'zel,"I expect improvement, else I hew another path."
Lae'zel,"I am nothing more than your ally, now - and barely even that."
Lae'zel,"It's clear - my needs, my desires, mean nothing to you. We had a connection, and you've severed it."
Lae'zel,"I've come to sate you, and be sated."
Lae'zel,But I didn't think you a half-wit. And my patience is dwindling.
Lae'zel,"Say 'yes', and you brave turbulent waters."
Lae'zel,"In my pleasure, you will have yours."
Lae'zel,But do not deceive yourself: our bond runs no deeper.
Lae'zel,"Up, now. The sun soon rises."
Lae'zel,"I am sure you learned much from my mastery, Gith-child. Your training continues apace."
Lae'zel,"You are a fit specimen. You might wield a silver sword of your own, should Vlaakith be so generous."
Lae'zel,Of course you did. I'm as extraordinary in bed as I am on the battlefield.
Lae'zel,Are you so offended by truth? You will find no better lay.
Lae'zel,"I intend to take my pleasure. Say the word 'no', and you will go untasted."
Lae'zel,"My hunger is sated for now, yes."
Lae'zel,"Time for pleasure has passed. I might take more later, should my whims so carry me."
Lae'zel,Of course. I'm as extraordinary a lover as I am warrior.
Lae'zel,"You are a fit specimen yourself, kin. Fit enough to wield a silver sword of your own, should Vlaakith be so generous."
Lae'zel,I am ready.
Lae'zel,You misunderstand. Allow me to be plain.
Lae'zel,You are here for my pleasure.
Lae'zel,"I might even lay you again, should my whims so take me."
Lae'zel,"Whatever you might call this bond we've built, you're quite near to breaking it."
Lae'zel,I'd thought you insufferable.
Lae'zel,"It is time you finally lend me your skills. We may locate this crèche together, and be purified."
Lae'zel,"I know a remedy. Release me, and I will share it."
Lae'zel,Mind flayers. The atrocities we are becoming.
Lae'zel,Questionable intellect. Unsurprising.
Lae'zel,Questionable intellect. I expect better of githyanki.
Lae'zel,Enough gawking - get me down.
Lae'zel,Slow to respond. Unsurprising.
Lae'zel,Have you come to your senses?
Lae'zel,Slow to respond. I expect better of githyanki.
Lae'zel,Hurry. We must explore the crèche - there is more I would know.
Lae'zel,"An abomination grows within you, yet you would refuse purification?"
Lae'zel,Any other 'cure' might be offered is a lie. Cast it from your mind.
Lae'zel,"Githyanki teaching is as infallible as Queen Vlaakith herself. To remove a tadpole, there are but two paths: purification at a crèche - or beheading."
Lae'zel,Onward. Our purification is at hand.
Lae'zel,You are full up. Dismiss your weakest warrior. I will wait here until you do.
Lae'zel,You try my patience.
Lae'zel,You left me for dead. I've killed my own cousins for considerably less.
Lae'zel,You survived longer than I expected without me to aid you.
Lae'zel,"I know of a cure. Lend me your skills, and I will take you to it."
Lae'zel,...you survived longer than I expected without me to aid you.
Lae'zel,And you...
Lae'zel,You survived longer than I expected. I cannot say the same for the tieflings you abandoned me with.
Lae'zel,A sensible choice. Our alliance has proven beneficial to us both.
Lae'zel,I know nothing more. No gith text describes such a weapon. I am not certain it even exists.
Lae'zel,Consider it the price for your purification.
Lae'zel,Gith runes. Yes - this must be it.
Lae'zel,I might have learned more had your mouth remained closed.
Lae'zel,"We will comb the mountain pass, and beyond."
Lae'zel,One must be close at hand. We will comb the mountain pass and beyond.
Lae'zel,"So says our Queen's teachings, and so it must be."
Lae'zel,An alliance is pragmatic - for the time being.
Lae'zel,"You possess a modicum of competence, though it pains me to say so."
Lae'zel,"Should briar hinder your path, do you not cut it down?"
Lae'zel,Naturally. I had a mission; they proved a barrier.
Lae'zel,"One is close at hand. Nestled here in this pass, quite possibly."
Lae'zel,Be healed!
Lae'zel,"I made an offer, and you accepted. Your fantasy is not my burden."
Lae'zel,"It is many things. A hatchery, a training grounds, a shelter."
Lae'zel,To your side!
Lae'zel,I will release you!
Lae'zel,Getting you free!
Lae'zel,Bound but not beaten!
Lae'zel,I will aid you.
Lae'zel,I bring aid.
Lae'zel,You have my attention.
Lae'zel,As an ally must.
Lae'zel,An unstoppable force.
Lae'zel,Proper measures.
Lae'zel,"There is no right or wrong, only truth."
Lae'zel,"What is the point, if not victory?"
Lae'zel,You are right to fear me.
Lae'zel,How embarrassing for you.
Lae'zel,A wise strategy.
Lae'zel,I suppose it's up to me.
Lae'zel,By my will!
Lae'zel,Ascend and conquer!
Lae'zel,You're needed in battle.
Lae'zel,I will assist.
Lae'zel,I won't let you suffer.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith's gift.
Lae'zel,All will be mended.
Lae'zel,Within reach.
Lae'zel,A worthy target.
Lae'zel,Consider me intrigued.
Lae'zel,Keen to talk.
Lae'zel,A pleasant exchange.
Lae'zel,A welcome reprieve.
Lae'zel,I relish our time.
Lae'zel,The correct outcome.
Lae'zel,Mastery in all things.
Lae'zel,Just so.
Lae'zel,"Support, close at hand."
Lae'zel,You were sloppy.
Lae'zel,As I must.
Lae'zel,"Quickly, then."
Lae'zel,Found and taken.
Lae'zel,I will take my pick.
Lae'zel,Securing.
Lae'zel,I will tend to your wounds!
Lae'zel,I bring you relief!
Lae'zel,Repositioning.
Lae'zel,I must show myself.
Lae'zel,A brief discussion.
Lae'zel,It cannot be avoided.
Lae'zel,A warrior's favour.
Lae'zel,Might made manifest.
Lae'zel,Queen's blessing upon you.
Lae'zel,I will not mince words.
Lae'zel,A word is in order.
Lae'zel,Proceeding.
Lae'zel,Objective noted.<br>
Lae'zel,Objective noted.
Lae'zel,Going into hiding.
Lae'zel,I will hunt from the shadows.<br>
Lae'zel,I will hunt from the shadows.
Lae'zel,My prey awaits.
Lae'zel,A hidden threat.
Lae'zel,Worth examining.
Lae'zel,I will not forget what you did here today. Nor will the githyanki people.
Lae'zel,My skills are needed.
Lae'zel,Worth the effort.
Lae'zel,A minor hindrance.
Lae'zel,A small hurdle.
Lae'zel,It will happen.
Lae'zel,A simple task.
Lae'zel,An efficient path.
Lae'zel,One true way.
Lae'zel,Under pressure.
Lae'zel,"A pity, that."
Lae'zel,Support incoming.
Lae'zel,I will not fail you.
Lae'zel,My first concern.
Lae'zel,Be there at once.
Lae'zel,Taste my fury!<br>
Lae'zel,Taste my fury!
Lae'zel,You bow - or you break!
Lae'zel,This is your end!
Lae'zel,I can help.
Lae'zel,Let my name be known!
Lae'zel,To the task.
Lae'zel,Fine - I'll help.
Lae'zel,We must speak.
Lae'zel,We must speak.<br>
Lae'zel,Let us have words.
Lae'zel,"Alas, time for chatter."
Lae'zel,Try to do better.
Lae'zel,"Alas, time for chatter.<br>"
Lae'zel,"We have unchained the true heir. First, he will lead us to victory against the Netherbrain -"
Lae'zel,"You have done it, Praise Vlaakith! Gith's faithless son is fallen!"
Lae'zel,My people possess the cure for this infection. I must find a crèche; you will join me.
Lae'zel,You will join me. We must find a crèche: our people possess the cure for this infection.
Lae'zel,"And the longer we wait, the more it consumes."
Lae'zel,"But the longer we wait, the more it consumes."
Lae'zel,Has the error of your ways become clear?
Lae'zel,I'd figured you a half-wit. To think I overestimated you.
Lae'zel,"- then, he will loose the githyanki from Vlaakith's undead talons."
Lae'zel,I have suffered one parasite; I can no longer suffer the other.
Lae'zel,You prove intolerable. We are done.
Lae'zel,"For this one moment, in this one battle, the lich queen and I share a common cause: the Netherbrain's defeat, and the Grand Design's failure."
Lae'zel,"Such blazing wonder, to stand together and behold the sky swarming with red dragons - they may roar Vlaakith's name, but I can't deny their beauty."
Lae'zel,The Netherbrain believes it will rise victorious. But it could never predict the extent of our might and the heat of our fury.
Lae'zel,"I shall slay the traitor prince once the brain has fallen, mark my words. Nothing will stop me."
Lae'zel,The Netherbrain will soon follow - and I shall ascend to my queen.
Lae'zel,No pleasure you could offer is worth the torment of our alliance.
Lae'zel,Show no mercy.
Lae'zel,Leave no survivors.
Lae'zel,By Vlaakith's might!
Lae'zel,You are worthy.
Lae'zel,Taking my due.
Lae'zel,You serve my purpose.
Lae'zel,A steady hand is needed.
Lae'zel,You won't deny me.
Lae'zel,A vital boost.
Lae'zel,Richly deserved.
Lae'zel,A critical step.
Lae'zel,"Rise, and be mighty."
Lae'zel,A remedy most potent.
Lae'zel,Be at ease.
Lae'zel,The bare minimum.
Lae'zel,Out of harm's way.
Lae'zel,You shall not fall!
Lae'zel,I will take every advantage.
Lae'zel,Make way!
Lae'zel,Make way!<br>
Lae'zel,My path be true.
Lae'zel,To battle!
Lae'zel,Htak'a!
Lae'zel,For the queen!
Lae'zel,Time to strike!
Lae'zel,Time to strike!<br>
Lae'zel,"I am fury, I am death!"
Lae'zel,"I am fury, I am death!<br>"
Lae'zel,Swift and lethal.
Lae'zel,Victory awaits!
Lae'zel,I will ascend!
Lae'zel,Taking position!
Lae'zel,Vlaakith guide me.
Lae'zel,No time to waste!
Lae'zel,On the move!
Lae'zel,My path be true.<br>
Lae'zel,Be whole!
Lae'zel,The voice is quelled. The artefact's doing...
Lae'zel,"Yes, for now."
Lae'zel,It is a certainty.
Lae'zel,Yes - the Hammer is ours!
Lae'zel,"The Emperor, yes - a stunning revelation. But not so stunning as the prisoner."
Lae'zel,"The illithid is a threat, make no mistake. But Orpheus is a greater one still."
Lae'zel,And even more powerful still. It's said could bring a thousand githyanki to their knees with one command.
Lae'zel,Our current Vlaakith has claimed undeath and reigned for a thousand years.
Lae'zel,Watch it - take the cane to those beasts again and this standoff turns to slaughter.
Lae'zel,I saw it too - adamantine. The forge is behind the rubble. And the duergar mean to lay claim to it.
Lae'zel,"And when I return to the Astral Prism, I will slay him in the name of the undying Queen Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,"The Spirits of the Fallen, be my witness: I will find the means of reaching the prince through his domed prison."
Lae'zel,"One word from his scheming lips, and the people would doubt. Two words, and they would rage. Three words, and they would bow to the False Prince."
Lae'zel,"If the githyanki are to be free, the Prince of the Comet must lead the way."
Lae'zel,"One word from his lips, and the people would doubt. Two words, and they would rage. Three words, and they would bow to the True Heir."
Lae'zel,This is the creed. I will not abandon all ten-thousand protocols over one sovereign secret.
Lae'zel,The seed - and the sower.
Lae'zel,A shame Voss can't share in our victory.
Lae'zel,We find a way to enter the Prism and slay Orpheus.
Lae'zel,"A god to the fishes. A dream come true, is it?"
Lae'zel,We meet Voss in the city. And we obtain the key to freeing Orpheus from his prison.
Lae'zel,The Astral Plane would be first to fall. The others would soon follow.
Lae'zel,"Should Orpheus go free, he would tear Vlaakith's empire to pieces and build new glory from the scraps."
Lae'zel,He convinced his own mother's honour guard to join a coup against Vlaakith One. He would have fed our empire to the illithids had he succeeded.
Lae'zel,But it was the first whom Orpheus tried to slay.
Lae'zel,Yes. Our current queen has claimed undeath and reigned for a thousand years.
Lae'zel,The first Vlaakith of many. It is Vlaakith One-Five-Seven whom my people now call 'queen'.
Lae'zel,The first Vlaakith of many. It is Vlaakith One-Five-Seven whom our people now call 'queen'.
Lae'zel,Tiamat gifted the githyanki our red dragons. Gith remained in the Hells and Tiamat's envoy proclaimed Vlaakith our ruler.
Lae'zel,"Listen close - the Emperor spoke only in half-truths. For you to know the tale of Orpheus, you must know the tale of Gith, and of Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,Listen close - the Emperor spoke only in half-truths. Let us remember our history together.
Lae'zel,"- it is Orpheus. The Blood of the Mother, the Prince of the Comet."
Lae'zel,Damn this target on my back - the tadpole in my skull still screams to be purified. 
Lae'zel,"We find the one Voss was meeting in the city. They hold the key to Orpheus' prison. It must be destroyed, and Voss' contact along with it."
Lae'zel,"I will carry his legacy, I will do him proud."
Lae'zel,"For now, keep focused. Raphael will come to take back his treasure."
Lae'zel,"A waste of a slave. He should be digging or scavenging, not... serving drinks."
Lae'zel,The god-queen of my people cannot kill someone herself?
Lae'zel,I spoke too hastily - please forgive me. 
Lae'zel,I just think a real god could kill whoever she wants. 
Lae'zel,I will not give it to you. This artefact is mine by rights.
Lae'zel,"I shall cleanse it for you, my Queen. Tell me how."
Lae'zel,The Deathless Queen has spoken. You will obey.
Lae'zel,"I will cleanse it for you, my Queen. Tell me how."
Lae'zel,Choose. But know this: the cost of refusal is great.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith's eyes see beyond the planes. We cannot hide.
Lae'zel,"I will wait here. Turn your back, and you will feel my blade against it."
Lae'zel,"Very well - my trust is yours. But it is fragile. Break it, and be broken."
Lae'zel,Come - we must enter the Prism. Its secrets are finally ours to know.
Lae'zel,I will not. I gave you my might. You will respect my charge.
Lae'zel,It is Nere's head that concerns us.
Lae'zel,"Praise Vlaakith, let it be done."
Lae'zel,"No! Vlaakith, purge me of this blight!"
Lae'zel,Out of my head!
Lae'zel,This is our chance to find out how much this devil bleeds.
Lae'zel,The means to Orpheus' release is in our hands.
Lae'zel,To the undercity - Voss must hear of our victory. 
Lae'zel,"Think this through. Strike a slave, and its owners will not simply stand by."
Lae'zel,To Sharess' Caress - Voss is still waiting. He must know of our victory.
Lae'zel,"When we next enter the Astral Prism, we will break Orpheus free."
Lae'zel,"I'm making the journey to the crèche, with or without you."
Lae'zel,"To think, Orpheus' release is within our grasp."
Lae'zel,"The traitor Prince Orpheus will follow, once we free him from his astral prison."
Lae'zel,"To think, the traitor prince's release is within our grasp."
Lae'zel,Kith'rak Voss. May the Astral Sea be still as you cross it.
Lae'zel,"When we next enter the Astral Prism, we will slay he who would take Vlaakith's throne."
Lae'zel,Nnngh!
Lae'zel,Mother Gith is sovereign no longer!
Lae'zel,"When we next enter the Astral Prism, the Prince of the Comet will soar again."
Lae'zel,"Further still, we must report the inquisitor's crimes to my venerable queen."
Lae'zel,Is our sole purpose to settle this one's petty feuds?
Lae'zel,"Further still, we must report the inquisitor's crimes to our venerable queen."
Lae'zel,Bah - a pathetic show. Yet undeniably satisfying to watch.
Lae'zel,This is the key Voss so ardently and courageously sought.
Lae'zel,- and we will make it the means of his killing.
Lae'zel,This Hammer - this is the key. This is the means by which the traitor prince Orpheus can be freed -
Lae'zel,"A future I will fight for, and one I would die for."
Lae'zel,"A fragile thing - easily lost, easily broken. But inside it, I glimpsed a speck of my people's future."
Lae'zel,Though perhaps - perhaps it was inevitable.
Lae'zel,"Do you see? Indulge one demand, and it only breeds another."
Lae'zel,Don't worry. I wouldn't hesitate.
Lae'zel,Let us spill blood. Duergar or myconid - I care not which. 
Lae'zel,And yet - I'm drawn to the warmth of it. A child of Gith grows within.
Lae'zel,Perhaps I might be the one to teach it of Vlaakith's Protocols.
Lae'zel,"Keep it close. Perhaps in our care, it might yet hatch."
Lae'zel,And yet - I'm drawn to the warmth of it. A child of Gith and a servant of Vlaakith grows within.
Lae'zel,"In its heat lives stimulation, and in its throbbing, exhilaration. An effigy of githyanki future, incubated inside a fragile shell."
Lae'zel,"If the egg survives in your care, I invite you to wallow in my wrongness with all the glee you can conjure."
Lae'zel,But it might also beget a fighter. And I intend to give it the chance.
Lae'zel,"The egg grows ever warmer, the hum of life within it louder. It may yet hatch - though not soon, by my estimation."
Lae'zel,Give it to me. Perhaps it will fare better under my care.
Lae'zel,Perhaps Crèche K'liir would take them in. Sa'varsh Urlon is a stern taskmaster. The fledgling would be stronger and smarter by dint of his teachings.
Lae'zel,After we free Orpheus we can visit the matter. If the egg hatches beforehand...
Lae'zel,"... well. We will shield it from the lich queen's zealots. Whatever may come, I will not let Vlaakith poison the fledgling with lies."
Lae'zel,Only if you want me to roast you over a campfire using my blade as a spit.
Lae'zel,"We must find a way into the House of Hope and retrieve the Hammer. When we next enter the Astral Prism, we will use it to smash Prince Orpheus out of his prison."
Lae'zel,After we free Orpheus we can revisit the matter. If the egg hatches beforehand...
Lae'zel,The very notion puts me ill at ease. Our camp has been visited by a scheming devil and tainted by the Chosen of Bhaal.
Lae'zel,It has afforded us as much disquiet as it has rest.
Lae'zel,Leave the egg with me. There's no need for further discussion.
Lae'zel,A camp once visited by a scheming devil is no safe haven for the unhatched. It has afforded us as much disquiet as it has rest.
Lae'zel,"An effigy of githyanki destiny, incubating before our very eyes."
Lae'zel,"I know it is a mere egg. It may never hatch. If it does, it might beget a failure."
Lae'zel,The very notion puts me ill at ease. Our camp has been visited by all manner of devils and tainted by the Chosen of Bhaal.
Lae'zel,No. I am not your servant to be commanded on whim.
Lae'zel,You betray the very reason you were hatched into this plane.
Lae'zel,"The Prince of the Comet will crush the lich queen Vlaakith, and usher in the Age of Orpheus."
Lae'zel,The tadpole in my skull still screams to be purified.
Lae'zel,I won't keep you from helping. But an explosion sounds far more entertaining.
Lae'zel,You promised we'd make for the crèche. Yet we still linger in these odious lands.
Lae'zel,"A madness you've cured, thank the Undying Queen."
Lae'zel,"These myconids are the welcoming sort, at least where blubbering gnomes are concerned."
Lae'zel,"So mad was I, that I allied with strangers."
Lae'zel,"Good-bye, and good luck."
Lae'zel,"A madman Volo may be, but I see no reason to blow him up over it."
Lae'zel,To the crèche - and do try to keep up.
Lae'zel,You may be right. I may be wrong. I hate that it's so.
Lae'zel,Damn it all.
Lae'zel,Very well. Let's see what this Moonrise illuminates.
Lae'zel,Hush. Do you hear it?
Lae'zel,No. And it's unlike any I've yet heard.
Lae'zel,Control your thoughts. It seems I'm not the only one listening.
Lae'zel,"Then control your thoughts, lest your mind be exploited."
Lae'zel,You bared your teeth and sprayed your venom. A threat to be savoured.
Lae'zel,We must find a way into the House of Hope and retrieve the hammer.
Lae'zel,To deal with this abomination? Nigh unthinkable. Yet even Vlaakith herself could not deny the ring's merit.
Lae'zel,"When we next enter the Astral Prism, we will use it to smash Prince Orpheus out of his prison, and then tear his vile head from his body."
Lae'zel,"Mighty Vlaakith, undying regent, hear my promise: the false prince will fall, and the Age of Vlaakith will be eternal."
Lae'zel,"I'm going to find our people. If you have any sense, you will follow."
Lae'zel,"I'm going to find my people. If you have any sense, you will follow."
Lae'zel,"Mother Gith, hear my promise: your son will rise again."
Lae'zel,"Forward, and forget my business at the crèche. You were right to lead us to Moonrise."
Lae'zel,"I'm going to our people. If you have any sense, you will follow."
Lae'zel,"I'm going to my people. If you have any sense, you will follow."
Lae'zel,I'm going to our people - it is our only hope of purification.
Lae'zel,I'm going to my people - it is our only hope of purification.
Lae'zel,"If you have any good sense, you will follow."
Lae'zel,You would threaten Lae'zel of K'liir?
Lae'zel,I sought to reach a crèche and be rid of these tadpoles. Now we stalk forgotten lands haunted by darkness.
Lae'zel,I can't do that. The person inside protects me from the Absolute.
Lae'zel,"As you say, my Queen. I will slay the Prism's occupant."
Lae'zel,"The swords cleave both meat and mind, body and brain. To swing one, mesmerising; to be slain by one, agonising."
Lae'zel,The dragons serve githyanki; I'll see it does you no harm.
Lae'zel,"The dragons serve githyanki, kin; it will do us no harm."
Lae'zel,Nonsense. They will lead us to the cure we seek.
Lae'zel,A crèche must be near. Come - my kin await.
Lae'zel,A red dragon! I envy its knight - would that I rode such a steed.
Lae'zel,"This accursed weapon has distorted his loyalty. He'd sever our heads, given the chance."
Lae'zel,Protocol Two-thousand-ten: 'No kith'rak shall intentionally harm Vlaakith's faithful in the course of a hunt.'
Lae'zel,"He'd have led us right to the crèche. Instead, he watches from the skies like a falcon - and we are his prey."
Lae'zel,Yet your head remains firmly atop your shoulders.
Lae'zel,"He would have made a valuable ally. Instead, he watches from the skies like a falcon - and we are his prey."
Lae'zel,The crèche cannot be far from where you met Voss. We must go there immediately.
Lae'zel,The crèche is not far from where you met Voss. We must go there at immediately.
Lae'zel,As I'd expect. Ancient githyanki symbols adorn the artefact's face.
Lae'zel,"Lead, then. Take us to our cure."
Lae'zel,"Now, to the point: The crèche cannot be far from where you met Voss. We must go there immediately."
Lae'zel,"Had I been travelling with you, we might have avoided the knight's fury."
Lae'zel,"Keep me at your side, and I will invoke protocol. It is my people's duty to aid infected githyanki."
Lae'zel,And I will leave behind this wretched realm to stand at my queen's right hand.
Lae'zel,Revolting. Corpses carry disease - they must be buried or burned.
Lae'zel,Then we will see the queen's justice done.
Lae'zel,"Yes. Judicious counsel - and vexing, given the source."
Lae'zel,And then - then I will skewer the heretic with his own silver sword.
Lae'zel,"I am impressed. He wanted your head, yet it remains firmly atop your shoulders."
Lae'zel,Speak! Have you killed our queen's enemy?
Lae'zel,A lesser man would be adorning the road as a shredded corpse.
Lae'zel,A lesser person would be adorning the road as a shredded corpse.
Lae'zel,"If by 'nice' you mean 'truthful', then consider me positively pleasant."
Lae'zel,"By Vlaakith, get out of my head!"
Lae'zel,"Now, to the point: The crèche is not far from where you met Voss. We must go there immediately."
Lae'zel,"Unless, of course, you'd rather sprout waxy tendrils where there were no tendrils before."
Lae'zel,"Keep me at your side, and I will invoke protocol. It is our people's duty to aid the infected."
Lae'zel,A lesser woman would be adorning the road as a shredded corpse.
Lae'zel,"A crèche is near, that much is certain. We follow the path forward and seek signs of githyanki settlers."
Lae'zel,Speak! Have you killed my queen's enemy?
Lae'zel,I'm tempted to claw your brain from your skull just to see what secrets slither inside -
Lae'zel,"The Tears span Toril's sky. There is more to the realm than this grassy pebble, kin."
Lae'zel,We infiltrated a neogi spelljammer and laid waste to its crew.
Lae'zel,My entire clutch battled beholders within the Eye of the Sky's tunnels.
Lae'zel,It is as we knew. My people have turned their blades against us.
Lae'zel,It is as we knew. Our people have turned their blades against us.
Lae'zel,Follow me. We are close to the cure we seek.
Lae'zel,'Only?'
Lae'zel,We infiltrated a neogi Spelljammer and laid waste to its crew.
Lae'zel,My entire clutch battled beholders deep within the Eye of the Sky.
Lae'zel,Do you think me so sheltered?
Lae'zel,Githyanki are hatched in crèches all throughout Realmspace. K'liir is one of many.
Lae'zel,Your curiosity is to be commended.
Lae'zel,The Tears follow behind it. Rocky bodies tumbling through the Sea of Night. One of them is my crèche: K'liir.
Lae'zel,Look above. Watch the moon cross the sky.
Lae'zel,Would that I were doing battle among the Tears.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith does not lie to Her faithful. Open your mind - show me.
Lae'zel,Unkillable? I don't believe you - show me your mind.
Lae'zel,But you've proven moderately useful. I will await word from Vlaakith. You may live for now.
Lae'zel,"I've a mind to end you here and now, but you either believe your own words - or have suddenly mastered the duplicitous arts."
Lae'zel,To the inquisitor - and let us see who speaks with serpent's tongue.
Lae'zel,You expect me to believe you? The inquisitor is Vlaakith's judgement made flesh. My Queen would not abandon me!
Lae'zel,To the inquisitor - and let him slice out your lying tongue.
Lae'zel,Impossible. Open your mind and show me.
Lae'zel,Blasphemy. She warned you not to trust the one inside!
Lae'zel,"Unusually robust uniforms - warriors fallen in battle, perhaps."
Lae'zel,"And she has since exacted her revenge, undoubtedly."
Lae'zel,Shar's name is no more our concern than a gnat's egg. Turn your attentions to something of actual import.
Lae'zel,"Bah - let Shar exact her own revenge, if she's so inclined. Our concerns lie far elsewhere."
Lae'zel,"Yes, we should press forward. These dead have no more tales to tell."
Lae'zel,And better off still than being skewered by the point of my blade.
Lae'zel,"Enough. Whatever your petty squabbles, let them rot with these corpses."
Lae'zel,"Yes, we should press forward. But let's not presume the past always remains buried."
Lae'zel,"No, I must look only ahead, never behind. I suggest you do the same."
Lae'zel,"The crèche is near, this much we know. We follow the path forward and into the valley."
Lae'zel,- all for the sake of this polyhedric 'weapon'.
Lae'zel,The surface is within reach. But it may be foolish to press on before finding this Nere.
Lae'zel,"He speaks of the shadow curse. Moonrise must be close, but it would be foolish to press on before seeking out this Nere."
Lae'zel,"Forward, then. No curse will keep me from purification."
Lae'zel,"You merely need to think 'strike', and it strikes. The sword carves the correct path, and carries your arm with it."
Lae'zel,"To break Orpheus free, we will need the Orphic Hammer."
Lae'zel,Only the Orphic Hammer can break Orpheus free.
Lae'zel,"Certainly not, or the prince's honour guard would have already fractured his prison."
Lae'zel,A dream we made reality.
Lae'zel,"I want more for myself than to languish. I want to battle, I want to bleed."
Lae'zel,They gaze on our peoples' great works but can't grasp their beauty. They will never understand the ecstasy of our hymns or the fury of our citadels.
Lae'zel,I've learned of your kind. The decadent and the indolent of Tu'narath.
Lae'zel,These tadpoles in our heads are sufficiently exceptional. I grant all my allies the right to my silver.
Lae'zel,The illithid Grand Design nears; the traitor prince must be slain. These are exceptional circumstances. I grant all my allies the right to my silver.
Lae'zel,The illithid Grand Design nears; the True Heir is shackled. These are exceptional circumstances. I grant my allies the right to my silver.
Lae'zel,"I will carry it for the honour of Gith, the great liberator - and her unforgotten son."
Lae'zel,'Only Gith's children may wield swords of silver - unless a githyanki grants the right in exceptional circumstance.'
Lae'zel,You should feel shamed by the lie you told to get it. But the silver is too pure to be tainted by simple deception.
Lae'zel,The House of Hope. We must find a way in.
Lae'zel,All blood I'll spill with this sword will feed Queen Vlaakith's legacy.
Lae'zel,It is almost tainted by your vile act. This is a weapon that is earned by deeds of legendary proportions.
Lae'zel,"I'm not familiar with that name. A Harper leader, perhaps."
Lae'zel,I resent how you came by it - but I cannot deny its power.
Lae'zel,Every gith has the right to prove themselves worthy of their silver.
Lae'zel,The ancient slates tell us that each sword holds a fragment of the Living Gate - a flesh-portal made from the stuffs of nightmare.
Lae'zel,That right was snatched from me. The sword is an ill-gotten prize - yet one I mustn't refuse.
Lae'zel,A silver sword.
Lae'zel,"He speaks of the shadow curse. Forget Nere and the Moonlantern - if we're this close to the surface, we must chance the journey."
Lae'zel,"The surface is within reach. Forget Nere, forget the Moonlantern - I hardly fear a few shadows."
Lae'zel,"The power of the blade cannot be understated. In this time of my people's greatest need, we must wield it still."
Lae'zel,Everyone I bleed with the sword will be my tribute to Prince Orpheus.
Lae'zel,A shame Voss won't be there to see the righteous carnage.
Lae'zel,"Gith's son will soon ride against Vlaakith, Voss. And I will follow him into battle."
Lae'zel,"I required your silence, and you made me a mockery!"
Lae'zel,Very well. Voss has done his duty. Now we will do ours.
Lae'zel,"The matter of the Traitor Voss, perhaps? If you meant to frustrate me, congratulations on your pathetic victory."
Lae'zel,- all for the sake of the artefact that we carry.
Lae'zel,Dammit all!
Lae'zel,"I am at your command, my Queen. The artefact is yours."
Lae'zel,"First, we fell the false prince. Next, the elder brain. And I will ascend to my queen in glory."
Lae'zel,We must find a way to the House of Hope and take the Orphic Hammer.
Lae'zel,"I am Lae'zel - daughter of Gith, defender of Vlaakith. And I am no slave."
Lae'zel,I am keen to sever Nere's head. A shame we must do the favour of freeing him first.
Lae'zel,"As for the gnome slaves, pay no heed. A bleeding heart is an unnecessary burden."
Lae'zel,Come - and pay no heed to their slaves. A bleeding heart is an unnecessary burden.
Lae'zel,"If you lust for blood, so be it - though scouting may be the wiser option."
Lae'zel,Let her try. My thirst for blood has yet to be quenched.
Lae'zel,"Still, it's a minor consideration: We know our most crucial duty."
Lae'zel,"The traitor Voss lives. If you meant to frustrate me, congratulations on your pathetic victory."
Lae'zel,"When we next enter the Astral Prism, we will use the hammer to break Orpheus free."
Lae'zel,We must find our way to the House of Hope and take the Orphic Hammer.
Lae'zel,"We will take the Orphic Hammer from the House of Hope. And when we next enter the Astral Prism, we will break Orpheus free."
Lae'zel,To the undercity. Voss deserves to know the Hammer is ours.
Lae'zel,"One last matter: the traitor Voss still lives. If you meant to frustrate me, congratulations on your pathetic victory."
Lae'zel,"This sword represents a githyanki's might. It is to be earned through trial and tribulation, not stolen."
Lae'zel,"This sword represents a githyanki's might. It is to be earned through trial and tribulation, not taken without permit."
Lae'zel,It is an ill-gotten prize - yet one I mustn't refuse.
Lae'zel,It is not in a githyanki's nature to say 'thank you'. Or at least - not in mine.
Lae'zel,It is not in a githyanki's nature to say 'thank you'.
Lae'zel,Very well - we know our duty.
Lae'zel,"But after releasing me from Orin's grip, there is only one proper response:"
Lae'zel,"Ah, hm. Well good then. Let's carry on."
Lae'zel,You acted most rationally. So acknowledged.
Lae'zel,"You're breathing right now, are you not? I think you'll find I've paid that debt in advance."
Lae'zel,But I admire your dedication to provoking me on the rare occasion of my gratitude. Well done.
Lae'zel,Voss has done his duty. Now we will do ours.
Lae'zel,"With the Prince of the Comet at our sides, we can end the Grand Design, and restore the throne to Gith's heir."
Lae'zel,Thank you. Sincerely.
Lae'zel,If only...
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith would never ascend a deviant like this. He will never know her protocols, never ride a dragon to the City of Death."
Lae'zel,Perhaps if he'd lived...
Lae'zel,"Blasphemy, to scrawl it here. And a colossal risk."
Lae'zel,The sign of Orpheus? Blasphemy. Would I could quarter the vandal myself.
Lae'zel,A wretched display. I thought you better than such juvenile antics.
Lae'zel,Pathetic and profane. You've the brain of a child.
Lae'zel,"No. NO! By the Queen's blade, what have you done?!"
Lae'zel,No. This cannot be - purification is my right! Treachery against my queen at every turn.
Lae'zel,I must see the inquisitor in his chamber. He will guide me to purity. He will see protocol done!
Lae'zel,"Queen Vlaakith, undying regent - I have followed protocol, yet I am forsaken!"
Lae'zel,I'll send a message to Vlaakith. The inquisitor's chambers - there must be a way...
Lae'zel,Rough?
Lae'zel,The locals prove compliant. A useful trait.
Lae'zel,Your kind proves compliant. A useful trait.
Lae'zel,Pursue the visions you saw. See where they lead.
Lae'zel,You will educate me on matters of this Fay-run.
Lae'zel,"I am unfamiliar with the - well, I shall not say 'culture'. 'Custom', perhaps."
Lae'zel,Tch.
Lae'zel,Then I needn't make it again.
Lae'zel,"By Vlaakith's blade, child - Orpheus is a traitor to our queen. Shut your mouth before the crèche elders hear your words."
Lae'zel,The faithful may be purified. This is Vlaakith's protocol!
Lae'zel,Go on. You know what we require.
Lae'zel,"I am a Child of Gith, not discarded rat-flesh. Am I not due your respect?"
Lae'zel,Leave him kneeling.
Lae'zel,You saw someone who looks like me. Where?
Lae'zel,"The sign of Orpheus. Centuries gone, yet his influence stretches across the planes."
Lae'zel,Indeed I have. Any last words?
Lae'zel,Very good. You can stand now.
Lae'zel,Leave him bowing.
Lae'zel,"The last time a subordinate questioned my judgement, I ate tongue stew that very night."
Lae'zel,"The teeth-ling was clear. If there are githyanki west of here, that must be our objective. Purification cannot wait."
Lae'zel,"Had you allowed me to speak, we would not be left without a plan."
Lae'zel,We scout the roads and scan the skies for children of Gith. Purification cannot wait.
Lae'zel,You saw other githyanki. Where?
Lae'zel,Stand up.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith herself. She is both the sun that blinds us and the void that contains us. Praise be.
Lae'zel,Quickly - find a way to shut this thing down!
Lae'zel,Choose. Your path is mine to follow.
Lae'zel,"Our fate is forged. Mother Gith, guide us!"
Lae'zel,Stand aside. My time has come.
Lae'zel,No. It cannot be. CANNOT!
Lae'zel,My queen.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith has spoken. You have listened. This is the way.
Lae'zel,Fool. You speak with the Lich Queen. You do not refuse Vlaakith.
Lae'zel,I am the only one denied my claim.
Lae'zel,You wouldn't dare! I -
Lae'zel,"Let this be a beginning, not an end."
Lae'zel,I must meditate. There is much to think on.
Lae'zel,Failure at the first hurdle of existence. Most caretakers would crush it and be done.
Lae'zel,"By Vlaakith's blade, what devil's got hold of you, that you'd slay an unborn?!"
Lae'zel,Stay your hand! The consequences may be more than we are ready to bear.
Lae'zel,Step away. And banish this mace from your mind.
Lae'zel,Forward - carefully. These cultists have the crèche on high alert.
Lae'zel,Acutely observed on both counts.
Lae'zel,"Soon, you will be vomiting blood and tearing apart your own flesh."
Lae'zel,Cold?
Lae'zel,Stand up. I got what I came for.
Lae'zel,What were you doing out at the pass?
Lae'zel,I fear this rock has twisted your mind more than the parasite ever could.
Lae'zel,Do you think yourself wiser than Vlaakith herself?
Lae'zel,"Don't be foolish. Provoke these githyanki, and they will crush your skulls into powder."
Lae'zel,"As it must be. In a crèche, there is purpose. In a temple, only platitudes and unheard prayer."
Lae'zel,"A temple to a trivial god, nested among the peaks. Fine grounds for a crèche."
Lae'zel,"Not to mention a fine site for a crèche, concealed among the peaks and ridges."
Lae'zel,You saw another githyanki. Where?
Lae'zel,Steal one of Gith's own? I will slit your throat for even suggesting it.
Lae'zel,"Nod your head, play along. Find out what you can, take her head when it's done."
Lae'zel,"Please, do enlighten me. What is this 'tradition'?"
Lae'zel,No. Merely the most efficient.
Lae'zel,"You test our Queen's patience. Surrender the artefact, or die by my hand."
Lae'zel,We're done. I got what I came for.
Lae'zel,"If they will not see sense, then bleed them dry!"
Lae'zel,Our greed reduced Crèche Y'llek to rubble. We didn't just steal a mace. We stole the lives of our people!
Lae'zel,Tsk'va. Gith m' zath'ak!
Lae'zel,It is done. There is no going back.
Lae'zel,"I am her child no more. I have been born anew in Gith's son, my saviour."
Lae'zel,"I am her child no more. I have been born anew in Gith's son, our saviour."
Lae'zel,But that time won't come until the Prince of the Comet flies again.
Lae'zel,There will come a time when I can think about myself beyond the lich queen who enslaves the githyanki and the prince who would liberate them.
Lae'zel,Orpheus' will above all. May the Comet blaze my path forward!
Lae'zel,Orpheus' will above all. May the Comet blaze our path forward!
Lae'zel,"Ch'mar, zal'a Orpheus. Mha stil'na forjun inyeri!"
Lae'zel,And so from the old battle cries is birthed another:
Lae'zel,"I have been born anew in Gith's son, my saviour."
Lae'zel,"I have been born anew in Gith's son, our saviour."
Lae'zel,"But this, I pledge: to honour Voss through my dedication to our shared cause - Orpheus' freedom, and Vlaakith's destruction."
Lae'zel,"So I did. I have no excuse, and I deserve no forgiveness."
Lae'zel,"I will have a home in Tu'narath yet, and Orpheus will be the light that guides me there."
Lae'zel,"No matter. I am Vlaakith's child no more. I have been born anew in Gith's son, my saviour."
Lae'zel,"You turned my eyes to the truth. My faith is acknowledged, my destiny set in slate."
Lae'zel,You turned my eyes to the truth. Vlaakith's forsaken me - and there's no going back.
Lae'zel,"As long as the Undying Queen reigns, I am never to soar unbound over the Astral Sea, never to cross the One in the Void."
Lae'zel,As it should be. Better a short life built on truth than immortality woven of lies.
Lae'zel,Better to unite the githyanki under a prince who would free their minds and honour their bodies.
Lae'zel,How well you've come to know me.
Lae'zel,Our greed reduced Crèche Y'llek to rubble. We didn't just steal a mace. We stole the lives of my people!
Lae'zel,"But in truth, she didn't take everything."
Lae'zel,"I am known and honoured by you, the source of my bruises - and the source of my joy."
Lae'zel,"I am known and honoured by you, the source of my bruises."
Lae'zel,Vlaakith cannot un-make she who no longer exists.
Lae'zel,"I know hate. It seethes and distils into molten rock, forever rattling in the belly."
Lae'zel,"But I've never known this. I feel no heat, no cold; I bear neither fangs nor talon. There is only... absence."
Lae'zel,"No matter. I am Vlaakith's child no more. I have been born anew in Gith's son, our saviour."
Lae'zel,"I have what I have gathered for myself. I'm moored to a new regent, a new land, and new allies."
Lae'zel,Calm yourself. I only want information.
Lae'zel,Absolutely none.
Lae'zel,"I do not expect you to mourn. But I will not tolerate your rejoicing, either."
Lae'zel,I want a taste of your devil's blood.
Lae'zel,"In Crèche K'liir, a formal greeting begins with a bow."
Lae'zel,Lower.
Lae'zel,No twisting? Kin must have been in a hurry.
Lae'zel,The map. Show me.
Lae'zel,Up. You can keep your innards.
Lae'zel,Cool your blood - I'll indulge you soon enough. 
Lae'zel,You dare interrupt? Has the tadpole ravaged your senses?
Lae'zel,Has the tadpole ravaged your senses? It is his suffering that will lead us to purity.
Lae'zel,K'chakhi!
Lae'zel,Yes. Your mediocre interrogation technique notwithstanding.
Lae'zel,Bow.
Lae'zel,Go on. Bow.
Lae'zel,Has the tadpole ravaged your senses? Sympathy will not lead us to purity.
Lae'zel,Tsk'va!
Lae'zel,"A warrior of your talents does not need looking after. You only need the next battle, then the next, then the next."
Lae'zel,Then we agree. Go - quickly.
Lae'zel,The Inquisitor might have still have helped us. He might have yet led us to our cleansing.
Lae'zel,Our own chance to purification is buried in that rubble!
Lae'zel,As you should be.
Lae'zel,"Our greed reduced Crèche Y'llek to rubble. Vlaakith, absolve my sin or skewer my heart. In each, you might make me worthy!"
Lae'zel,Your greed reduced Crèche Y'llek to rubble. You didn't just steal a mace. You stole the lives of our people!
Lae'zel,Your greed reduced Crèche Y'llek to rubble. You didn't just steal a mace. You stole the lives of my people!
Lae'zel,I care.
Lae'zel,Someone must have tampered with it. An aberrance I can't begin to comprehend.
Lae'zel,Few would dare dishonour their queen. Fewer still would be so brazen.
Lae'zel,You have my thanks. Begrudgingly.
Lae'zel,"The doctor, the Inquisitor - such heresy beggars belief. To the command centre. We might find a way to inform Vlaakith of their treason."
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith must have some purpose, some design I'm not meant to see."
Lae'zel,I learned much under these very skies. Such pleasure to see them once more.
Lae'zel,'Thank you.' Happy? Good.
Lae'zel,A deception - proof of the doctor's manipulations. The queen does not mislead Gith's children.
Lae'zel,You are too easily astonished. There is more to this realm than this grassy pebble.
Lae'zel,Do it. Do not disobey the Inquisitor.
Lae'zel,Insert the artefact - or I take it from your corpse. This is the way forward.
Lae'zel,That key could mean Vlaakith's end - and that of my people.
Lae'zel,That key could mean Vlaakith's end - and that of our people.
Lae'zel,Very well - we know our task. Find Voss' contact in Baldur's Gate. They hold the key to setting the Prism's dweller loose.
Lae'zel,"If the Prism's occupant could bring such a horror to pass, I will exterminate them with prejudice."
Lae'zel,The reins to a thousand dragons and the helms of a thousand spelljammer vessels.
Lae'zel,"At first, I thought he might crave power and control."
Lae'zel,"We are honoured with an eternal home in the Astral, not devoured by our queen like meat at the feast table."
Lae'zel,"Ascension is a young githyanki's greatest honour, not this... this craven conspiracy Voss tried to poison us with."
Lae'zel,"Protect yourself. For now, we've no other choice - when she hears the truth, Vlaakith will absolve us."
Lae'zel,"Until then, her warriors will hunt us. If they can't see reason, they'll see the gleam of a blade as it severs their necks."
Lae'zel,So we will. Though I don't yet know when or how.
Lae'zel,The truth is bound to reach her ears. I don't yet know when or how.
Lae'zel,"And like any threat, it must be eliminated. We must find a way."
Lae'zel,We must slay them both.
Lae'zel,I can't say. What matters is that they are a threat to Queen Vlaakith.
Lae'zel,I have honoured the ten-thousand protocols. I will ascend.
Lae'zel,This is how I will regain your favour.
Lae'zel,"Odious words, but I must speak them: in this matter alone, I believe the illithid."
Lae'zel,Choose as you will.
Lae'zel,"By Mother Gith's silver blade, are we left with no choice but to assimilate the Prince of the Comet?"
Lae'zel,Search the bodies. We might find a way to the crèche.
Lae'zel,"Forward, through the pass - the crèche is near."
Lae'zel,"You inflict the wound, then expect to heal it with 'sorries'. Keep them."
Lae'zel,"But they are no mere aphorism. They are law, they are creed - the root from which the ten-thousand protocols stem."
Lae'zel,As if I'd forgotten.
Lae'zel,"Ch'k'l Voss, Vlaakith m' zath'ak."
Lae'zel,Voss was a heretic. You can no more extinguish the Undying Queen than you can the constellations.
Lae'zel,Voss was a heretic. You can no more stand against Vlaakith's will than you can extinguish the sun.
Lae'zel,"Then I will gut them too, and present their head to Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,Then I will gut them all and present their heads to Vlaakith.
Lae'zel,I will go to Baldur's Gate and punish the one who holds the means of your fall.
Lae'zel,"Yes. We must move, and quickly."
Lae'zel,"If the illithid speaks true and we slay the traitor, we will be lost to the void that is the Netherbrain."
Lae'zel,"'Forsake one protocol, and forsake Vlaakith. Forsake Vlaakith, and be the blood and meat which sates her dragons.'"
Lae'zel,She has sinned against me.
Lae'zel,"He will never suffer under Vlaakith's yoke. But he will also never see the crash of the Comet, or live freely in the prince's glow."
Lae'zel,"How might that boy have served his people, if he'd only been given the chance?"
Lae'zel,"Mother Gith would have me look ahead, never behind. But I can only wonder -"
Lae'zel,His death was a blessed escape. He could never understand the weight of Vlaakith's chains... or the relief to come when Orpheus lifts them.
Lae'zel,"You can still take it back by force. You've spilled your share of blood. What's a little more, if it means proving you haven't fully lost your failing senses?"
Lae'zel,Who knows what atrocities will be inflicted upon it?
Lae'zel,Who knows what atrocities will be inflicted upon it? I would have expected better of a child of Gith.
Lae'zel,"Bah - that was a githyanki egg, not some arcane curiosity for pawning off on shady scholars!"
Lae'zel,"We'll meet Kith'rak Voss at Sharess' Caress, in Baldur's Gate. Until then, be vigilant. Vlaakith's eyes are upon us."
Lae'zel,Your pace has slowed. Are you unwell?
Lae'zel,Then I shall make up for your shortcomings. As I have all along.
Lae'zel,Finely spotted. I've developed a taste for this pastime you call 'humour'.
Lae'zel,"Now come, and be heedful. The shadows are watching."
Lae'zel,Have you known me to joke?
Lae'zel,Well done. You're beginning to trust your convictions. 
Lae'zel,Your confidence grows. I'd almost think you believed your own words.
Lae'zel,"Hardly. But go on, live your fantasy. I am not about to stop you."
Lae'zel,"If I must question one protocol, I must question them all. Including every history I've read of Gith's Son, the so-called traitor prince."
Lae'zel,I don't know. I can't know. And that drives me mad.
Lae'zel,"At first, I thought them an illithid deception, a trick of the tadpole."
Lae'zel,But the dream figure is real. It lives in the Prism.
Lae'zel,Voss believes they are the seed of Vlaakith's demise and the agent of githyanki freedom.
Lae'zel,And I believe he may be right.
Lae'zel,"If Voss speaks true - if ascension is a lie, if tadpole purification is a fairy tale, then I have not sinned against Vlaakith..."
Lae'zel,But Voss believes they are the seed of Vlaakith's demise and the agent of githyanki freedom.
Lae'zel,"Obvious, you say. But does the dragon of the sky ever look to the worm, and dream of crawling?"
Lae'zel,"I was taught but one way, the superior way. Vlaakith's way."
Lae'zel,"Until now, I never thought Vlaakith a tyrant or me as a vassal. She was the source of my might, and I the envoy of her will."
Lae'zel,Yes. I'd like time to think.
Lae'zel,Something's wrong - your manner betrays you. What curse has this plant wrought?
Lae'zel,Then gather your wits - these amateur dramatics wear thin.
Lae'zel,They would feed me to their dragons. And I would deserve no better.
Lae'zel,Place the artefact in the planecaster. I'm waiting.
Lae'zel,"Refuse assimilation, and we shall do just that. If the Emperor has misled us, our beating hearts and sound minds will be the proof of it."
Lae'zel,"You led us through briar and bramble, you affirmed my faith when it faltered."
Lae'zel,Break the traitor prince free. It is time he pay penance for his crimes against my people.
Lae'zel,Break the traitor prince free. It is time he pay penance for his crimes against our people.
Lae'zel,"And be careful! Do him any harm, and I will bisect you. Mercilessly, torturously, slowly."
Lae'zel,Take the hammer and smash the crystals binding the Prince of the Comet.
Lae'zel,"Smash the crystals with the Orphic Hammer. Once the fell prince is free, we'll strike him down. The Age of Vlaakith will last eternal!<br>"
Lae'zel,Gith's beloved son will lead us to a sure victory against the Netherbrain.
Lae'zel,"Smash the crystals with the hammer, and free the Prince of the Comet."
Lae'zel,Raphael saw to that.
Lae'zel,This elder brain can use the tadpole to seize minds. What more is that abomination capable of?
Lae'zel,"My Queen, hear me!"
Lae'zel,"Lies! Vlaakith, my Queen - COMPLETE ME!"
Lae'zel,"If it must be so, it must be so. Do not fail me. Do not fail us."
Lae'zel,Lash'a'kla! Lash'a'kla! Lash'a'kla!
Lae'zel,I will not turn from my queen! EXALTED VLAAKITH. I AM RESTORED!
Lae'zel,MY QUEEN! MAKE ME WHOLE!
Lae'zel,I feel it. Skin stretching. Mind failing. NGH!
Lae'zel,"Yes. Yes! Relieve me, Vlaakith!"
Lae'zel,"I warned you, and you still turn away. This will not stand!"
Lae'zel,"Place the artefact. Or do not, and feel my bite."
Lae'zel,Your chance has come. Place the artefact - or know my rage.
Lae'zel,"By Vlkaakith's will, end the Prism-dweller. Violently."
Lae'zel,Betrayer. I will enjoy this.
Lae'zel,I'm not swayed by your little parlour trick. I will be cleansed; then you may follow.
Lae'zel,"Use the tadpole, assimilate Orpheus. This is our only choice."
Lae'zel,The brain seized control with the smallest of efforts. Its power must not be underestimated.
Lae'zel,I'm in no mood to exchange threats. I will enter first; your time will come.
Lae'zel,I do so enjoy when you choose boldness over blandness.
Lae'zel,I hear you and I deny you. Your turn will come.
Lae'zel,"Incredible - space, unfettered from time. The Astral Plane, just as I've dreamt it."
Lae'zel,"Boundless, timeless - like every dream that ever was, stitched together. It is home."
Lae'zel,You walk the line between confident and arrogant. A beguiling turn of events.
Lae'zel,"A persuasive argument, if not the most eloquent."
Lae'zel,I hate that this gift must also be such a burden. But I would trust no one else with it.
Lae'zel,"O Undying Queen of the noble githyanki, God Regent of the Six Arms of Tu'narath: today, your will is done!"
Lae'zel,"Go ahead - assimilate the Prince of the Comet. Mother Gith, may your spirit hear me:"
Lae'zel,So you've seen the truth. Perhaps I shouldn't have been so shamed by it.
Lae'zel,Either Orpheus is assimilated. Or the Netherbrain takes our minds and bodies for its own.
Lae'zel,"Either Orpheus is assimilated. Or I slay him in Vlaakith's name, and the Netherbrain takes our minds and bodies for its own."
Lae'zel,"Just smile and nod. We'll decide at our own leisure, not his."
Lae'zel,Ha! Betraying so quickly? Be careful your backstabbing arm doesn't get tired.<br>
Lae'zel,Ha! Betraying so quickly? Be careful your backstabbing arm doesn't get tired.
Lae'zel,"And you expect me to sacrifice a lifetime of faith? To forget ascension, to give up the very stuff I am made from?"
Lae'zel,Go. Choose what is right. Choose assimilation.
Lae'zel,And I will rip apart your own flesh if you refuse me and find a way to let Orpheus go free.
Lae'zel,"If I must be enthralled, then I will at least know the pleasure of tearing the prince apart with my own hands."
Lae'zel,Protocol Twenty: 'No alliance is above you nor beneath you if in service to Vlaakith's command.'
Lae'zel,But a choice I will not resist should you make it.
Lae'zel,"A repugnant choice, a cowardly choice."
Lae'zel,But that does not mean I wish an illithid to carry Orpheus' power. Better it lives within you than within it.
Lae'zel,I should fetch Gale. He'd want to set eyes on these relics.
Lae'zel,"Odious words, but I must speak them: in this matter, I believe the Emperor speaks true."
Lae'zel,...and I will speak the Rite of Ascension and fly to the Astral Plane.
Lae'zel,"Your beloved son will perish in honour, his life given so the Grand Design might be thwarted."
Lae'zel,"Ch'mar, zal'a Gith. Ch'mar, zal'a Gith. Ch'mar, zal'a Gith."
Lae'zel,No - I will not accept that. I will not see the Prince of the Comet destroyed.
Lae'zel,Reeducation. Viconia would feed Shadowheart a doctrine of lies before she could see the plain truth.
Lae'zel,"Assimilate Orpheus, and I will rip off your every limb and bask in your agony!"
Lae'zel,Do it.
Lae'zel,"By Mother Gith's silver blade, are we left with no choice?"
Lae'zel,Mother Gith's only son has suffered long in his prison.
Lae'zel,"Then smash the crystals with the Orphic Hammer, and free the Prince from his bonds."
Lae'zel,"If they want our heads, best we take theirs first."
Lae'zel,"Smash the crystals with the Orphic Hammer. Once the fell prince is free, we'll strike him down. The Age of Vlaakith will last eternal!"
Lae'zel,It is the fate you and I have spent countless days trying to avoid since the parasites slithered into our skulls.
Lae'zel,"And now it is the fate it seems you must accept, if we're to fell the unfaithful prince and fulfil Vlaakith's mission."
Lae'zel,"Assimilate Orpheus, wield his power. Vlaakith's knights will fly to our aid - we will slaughter the brain, end the Grand Design..."
Lae'zel,"Refuse the Emperor. Better yet, crush his revolting skull and let this Prism be his grave."
Lae'zel,I see naught but cowards cowering in their groves and grottos.
Lae'zel,"Now, to the point: Voss revealed the crèche's location. We must go there immediately."
Lae'zel,"They rely on strangers' swords, when they should be forging their own."
Lae'zel,The traitor Voss waits in Sharess' Caress. We shouldn't keep him waiting.
Lae'zel,I was born to wield the kith'rak's silver sword.
Lae'zel,To wield a knight's silver sword is my destiny.
Lae'zel,"They are githyanki knights, the commissars and enforcers of my Queen Vlaakith's will. To die in her name is their last act of reverence."
Lae'zel,He knows something. And I mean to know it too.
Lae'zel,Yet he speaks one truth: we have yet to turn.
Lae'zel,Respect? Raphael plays a liar's game. Only my kin can purify us.
Lae'zel,We shall know in time.
Lae'zel,"Dragons' blood flows in you, does it not? Perhaps you might be availed of the... riches I offer."
Lae'zel,Do not pity them. They reap great riches from their service - gold and otherwise.
Lae'zel,But I am not one to question the wisdom of my Queen. I can see but to the horizon. Vlaakith's sight pierces the many planes.
Lae'zel,But let us not question the wisdom of our Queen. We can see but to the horizon. Vlaakith's sight pierces the many planes.
Lae'zel,"I will ride a red dragon. I will wield the sword. And I will conquer every layer of Hell, should my Queen command it."
Lae'zel,Steel and iron may be no match for him. But a githyanki knight's silver sword would pierce him through - even amid the fires of Avernus.
Lae'zel,"I will ride a red dragon. I will wield the silver sword. And I will conquer every layer of Hell, should my Queen command it."
Lae'zel,I will sit astride one. It is only a matter of time.
Lae'zel,"I will earn my Queen's favour. And I will conquer every layer of Hell, should she command it."
Lae'zel,"A mistake? Spilling your soup, mispronouncing a word - these are 'mistakes'. "
Lae'zel,Our alliance grows fragile. See that you don't break it.
Lae'zel,Is my life nothing but a game of lanceboard to you? Is it your habit to smash the pieces as your finishing move?
Lae'zel,What has come over you?
Lae'zel,Silence is all you can muster? An extraordinary show of contempt. Is our bond worth so little?
Lae'zel,I will not forgive this. And I will not forget this.
Lae'zel,Waste no more time. Place the artefact in the Planecaster.
Lae'zel,Silence is all you can muster? An extraordinary show of contempt from one I've called ally.
Lae'zel,"Besides. Why kill him, when we can torture him with the death of his beloved prince?"
Lae'zel,We've got the hammer. Orpheus will die horribly - and Voss will suffer knowing he all but swung the sword that killed him.
Lae'zel,All that remains for us is to return to the Astral Prism and slaughter the false prince.
Lae'zel,"You saw the red dragons slaying his infernal kin above Hell's fires, did you not?"
Lae'zel,Githyanki knights. The riders that chased the nautiloid. They are the commissars and enforcers of my Queen Vlaakith's will.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith bestows no greater honour. The bastard at the pass made a mockery of it.
Lae'zel,"You let Voss live. I suppose I should be angry - but at this point, I'm simply amused."
Lae'zel,"On this, you have my word."
Lae'zel,"Did you see, at the mountain pass crossroads?"
Lae'zel,"Did you see, near the road that we came from?"
Lae'zel,Curious. I drained you dry. Yet your body seems no more worse for wear.
Lae'zel,In a moment. I need to think.
Lae'zel,The Undying Queen has spoken.
Lae'zel,A welcome face. How can I help?
Lae'zel,"Orpheus' greatest champion, snuffed out before he could see the Prince of the Comet tear through Realmspace and beyond."
Lae'zel,"Voss will be pleased with our progress. Come, to the underground. We must show him the Orphic Hammer."
Lae'zel,"Astonishing, truly."
Lae'zel,Baldur's Gate at last. We should find Sharess' Caress - Voss will be waiting.
Lae'zel,To Baldur's Gate. Voss will be waiting in this 'Sharess' Caress'.
Lae'zel,You have invited your own misery. I will not break our alliance for it - but I will not condone it.
Lae'zel,"But make no mistake, I can see the change in you, feel the parasite worming its way through you even further."
Lae'zel,I'd chide you if my mind were not consumed by the sight of the fell prince Orpheus within his domed prison.
Lae'zel,"Inconceivable, that we would seek release from one tadpole only for you to commune with another."
Lae'zel,We must go to Raphael. He holds the key to the prince's release - and his demise.
Lae'zel,How can I assist?
Lae'zel,"He has seen my people. And where we find githyanki, we will find their crèche."
Lae'zel,"He has seen our people. And where we find githyanki, we will find their crèche."
Lae'zel,Our greed nearly brought Crèche Y'llek to ruin.
Lae'zel,Protocol Three-Hundred One: 'Every great tragedy stems from reckless roots.' Words I shan't forget.
Lae'zel,Speak. Quickly.
Lae'zel,That was abominable.
Lae'zel,Forward. The Netherbrain must fall before the Prince of the Comet can grace the Astral Sea.
Lae'zel,"Speak, and be done with it."
Lae'zel,We have to free Orpheus from his domed prison. And it seems Raphael holds the key.
Lae'zel,"We must slay the Netherbrain. Right now, that's all that matters."
Lae'zel,But I still might earn my beloved queen's favour.
Lae'zel,Insert the artefact into the crèche's planecaster. We will kill the threat inside -
Lae'zel,"In so doing, I will prove my faith to my queen."
Lae'zel,Not now. I need time to think.
Lae'zel,You must have questions.
Lae'zel,We have yet to find Zorru. Or have you so quickly forgotten?
Lae'zel,You refused the Undying Queen.
Lae'zel,"We will return Orpheus to his people, or you will feel the heat of my fury."
Lae'zel,"I've half a mind to tear your limbs off, one by one. By Mother Gith's silver sword, what were you thinking?"
Lae'zel,A simple trade? More deception. Take her head.
Lae'zel,"We're close. Soon, we'll slay the Netherbrain and end the Grand Design."
Lae'zel,Six months? Are nine Hells so few that you would make our lives a tenth?
Lae'zel,Gone. The Hells have claimed their prize.
Lae'zel,A pity for us both you have promised yourself to another.
Lae'zel,I've no doubt he will satisfy your tastes for the mundane.
Lae'zel,A pity for us you have promised your body to the Blade.
Lae'zel,I've no doubt she will satisfy your tastes for the mundane.
Lae'zel,A pity for us you have promised your body to the tiefling.
Lae'zel,I've no doubt he's as seductive as he is succinct.
Lae'zel,A pity for us you have promised your body to Gale.
Lae'zel,"Oh, but do enjoy yourself this night. I intend to, myself. Gale looks particularly tempting."
Lae'zel,"Oh, but do enjoy yourself this night. I intend to, myself. Wyll looks particularly tempting."
Lae'zel,"I will take pleasure when I wish, and from whom I wish. Gale looks particularly tempting tonight."
Lae'zel,"I will take pleasure when I wish, and from whom I wish. Wyll looks particularly tempting tonight."
Lae'zel,"There are, after all, other spreads before me. Gale looks particularly tempting tonight."
Lae'zel,"There are, after all, other spreads before me. Wyll looks particularly tempting tonight."
Lae'zel,About that - I have regrets. 
Lae'zel,A beautiful lie. But a lie nonetheless.
Lae'zel,You know more. What else can you tell me?
Lae'zel,Who are you fighting? 
Lae'zel,What is this place? 
Lae'zel,How is it that you appear to me as my Queen?
Lae'zel,Why does my queen want you dead?
Lae'zel,He crossed blades with a githyanki. Few survive the ordeal. Fewer still claim victory.
Lae'zel,"I may kill you yet. But first, I want answers."
Lae'zel,"Vlakith, my Queen. I don't understand."
Lae'zel,"I can see through your lies, creature. You are not Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,Vlaakith? My eternal Queen. Let the planes know Your glory.
Lae'zel,Try to kill the figure again.
Lae'zel,"Wait, aren't you supposed to be dead? "
Lae'zel,I stand by my choice. 
Lae'zel,You are an agent of the Grand Design. Vlaakith told me so.
Lae'zel,Hurry forth. Purification is at hand.
Lae'zel,It is a map. A githyanki crèche lies within an ancient temple at the mountain pass.
Lae'zel,It is a map. Zorru did not lie - a crèche lies within an ancient temple at the mountain pass.
Lae'zel,Voss is waiting beneath the city. We'll apprise him of our progress once we have the Orphic Hammer in hand.
Lae'zel,"Yes, kin. Speak."
Lae'zel,Go ahead.
Lae'zel,"Forward, only ever forward."
Lae'zel,"First, the Netherbrain falls. Then, I slay the traitorous prince."
Lae'zel,Approach with caution. One mistake could be costly.
Lae'zel,Are there other matters to discuss?
Lae'zel,Is something burdening you?
Lae'zel,"We must press forward. Let's deal with Ketheric, then find Voss in Baldur's Gate."
Lae'zel,"A glorious day. We will slay the Netherbrain, and I will ascend to my queen."
Lae'zel,"We must press forward. First, let's deal with Ketheric. Then, I will find a way to prove my faith to the Undying Queen."
Lae'zel,The crèche must be nested in that temple. Our cure is close.
Lae'zel,I can't unlock this from here.
Lae'zel,Another deception. Take her head.
Lae'zel,Voss was meeting someone in Sharess' Caress - someone who possesses the key to Orpheus' prison. We should find them at once.
Lae'zel,Curious. I took of you completely. Yet your body seems no more worse for wear.
Lae'zel,I should have ended you when I had the chance.
Lae'zel,"Hear me, knight. I must..."
Lae'zel,The map is clear - we will soon reach a githyanki crèche. It lies within an ancient temple at the mountain pass.<br>
Lae'zel,Zorru did not lie - we will soon reach a githyanki crèche. It lies within an ancient temple at the mountain pass.<br>
Lae'zel,I must hurry forth. Purification is at hand.
Lae'zel,The map is clear - I will soon reach a githyanki crèche. It lies within an ancient temple at the mountain pass.<br>
Lae'zel,Zorru did not lie - I will soon reach a githyanki crèche. It lies within an ancient temple at the mountain pass.<br>
Lae'zel,A githyanki slate. Give it here!
Lae'zel,You do not understand. I heed Vlaakith's call.
Lae'zel,Put the slate away.
Lae'zel,Flowering meadows and fecund soil have softened their minds and muscles.
Lae'zel,Purification is finally at hand.
Lae'zel,A githyanki crèche lies beyond the mountain pass.
Lae'zel,"You. Stay put, and keep your lips sealed."
Lae'zel,"Stay put, and keep your lips sealed."
Lae'zel,Speak. Be quick.
Lae'zel,Activate the slate.
Lae'zel,I'm not going to kill the one who's protecting me. 
Lae'zel,Perhaps I might find use for it again...
Lae'zel,Rest. Weary bones are destined to crack.
Lae'zel,Nor have I. They come to the Material Plane just long enough to pass their eggs.
Lae'zel,'Dispiriting' is a strong word. 'Unusual'? Most certainly.
Lae'zel,"We are honoured with an eternal home in the Astral, celebrated for our victory. We are ascended. Or so I believed."
Lae'zel,"We are honoured with an eternal home in the Astral, celebrated for our victory. We are ascended."
Lae'zel,"Then we speak the Rite of Ascension, and a red dragon comes to fly us to Vlaakith in Tu'narath, City of Death."
Lae'zel,Ascension is a young githyanki's greatest honour.
Lae'zel,- but to raise Vlaakith to true godhood.
Lae'zel,"Then I am no destroyer. I am mere livestock, bred to be harvested and devoured."
Lae'zel,"But if Voss is right, and Vlaakith consumes the ascended to gain power..."
Lae'zel,"I'd never thought Vlaakith a tyrant, or me as a vassal. She was the source of my might, and I the envoy of her will."
Lae'zel,"The Undying Queen is ruthless because she has to be. Thanks to her, we endure. All of us."
Lae'zel,"The githyanki are the bulwark preventing illithid advance across the sixteen planes. One crack, and the bulwark collapses."
Lae'zel,"We githyanki are the bulwark preventing illithid advance across the sixteen planes. One crack, and the bulwark collapses."
Lae'zel,A tyrant cracks her whip and eradicates the weak for her own advance.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith is no tyrant.
Lae'zel,"Of one thing, I'm most certain: I will kill them as I killed Voss, and Vlaakith will gift me with unspoiled silver."
Lae'zel,- and thus the means to end Vlaakith's reign and weaken the empire.
Lae'zel,"Your lie is plain as fangs in your mouth, and still you stand by it."
Lae'zel,"Which means you are either a halfwit, or you think I am."
Lae'zel,"For now, I'll let you live. I'll even let you keep the privilege of my alliance."
Lae'zel,"But if you so much as smack your lips when I'm near, I will sever you piece by piece."
Lae'zel,Voss did not work alone.
Lae'zel,"His contact in Baldur's Gate holds the means of releasing the one in the Prism, the means of the Githyanki Empire's destruction."
Lae'zel,By all means - let us see what his 'skilled hand' might get up to.
Lae'zel,I will find out who this contact is. And I will destroy them and their key.
Lae'zel,Another empty promise. Only a naive fool would believe otherwise. The kind of fool I was not so long ago.
Lae'zel,"Every githyanki, and every red dragon, shall know me by the name."
Lae'zel,Lae'zel of the recent past might have thought so.
Lae'zel,"What young githyanki mightn't dream of becoming commander of all dragons, Chosen of the Queen Regent?"
Lae'zel,"So it is. Vlaakith's left hand, and her right - commander of all dragons, Chosen of the Queen Regent."
Lae'zel,Only that they have the means to let the Prism's occupant loose -
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith's left hand, and her right - commander of all dragons, Chosen of the Queen Regent."
Lae'zel,Don't tell me you intend to cling to this ridiculous deceit.
Lae'zel,"They must, of course - the eggs could never mature in the Astral Plane, where time barely passes."
Lae'zel,Indeed? Perhaps you might have paid more mind to your teacher.
Lae'zel,I know what you can barely fathom. That you cannot bear it makes it no less true.
Lae'zel,"Countless scholars roam the Astral Sea and beyond - observing the ways of our lessers, exploring planes so distant, order turns to chaos and cold fires rage."
Lae'zel,"Not books, but slates. Wisdom so profound it is etched into stone. Truth as perfect as the Queen who decreed it. "
Lae'zel,... yet we still collect more. Infinities upon infinities.
Lae'zel,I know those symbols - githyanki runes. Ancient as Vlaakith herself. You stole that from my people.
Lae'zel,"For now. But any crimes against my kin will be answered for, in time."
Lae'zel,"The planes are ever quaking, and their peoples ever shifting. The githyanki possess an eternity of knowledge..."
Lae'zel,"Now I have seen you enlightened, I will report your progress to Vlaakith herself, once I ascend."
Lae'zel,Or you simply weren't listening.
Lae'zel,"The library was a gift from Vlaakith herself, that we may gain total understanding."
Lae'zel,Entirely. I was as devoted to my studies as I was to my training.
Lae'zel,"I am what I must be, say what I must be, to survive every beast I face and every wound I bear."
Lae'zel,I know only blood-red and death-black. My mind is silver and my body steel.
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith requires everything of her children. I can't count how many bruises I've inflicted, can't measure how much blood I've drawn in the Undying Queen's name."
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith requires everything of her children. Think of how many bruises you've inflicted, how much blood you've drawn in the Undying Queen's name."
Lae'zel,If you must know:
Lae'zel,They underestimated me. So they paid the price.
Lae'zel,'Humanoid'. How I despise the term. Githyanki are quite superior to humans.
Lae'zel,Though it must be said: you are an uncommonly adequate member of your species.
Lae'zel,Our biology slates state that githyanki came to lay eggs after we escaped illithid enslavement and took to the Astral Plane.
Lae'zel,"It's an asexual process - a favourable change, by any estimation."
Lae'zel,"The queen assigns when and where they must lay, and how many eggs they must bear."
Lae'zel,"It is a meticulous process, carefully timed so that the eggs hatch at once."
Lae'zel,One that I hope is never bestowed on me.
Lae'zel,"Go on, then."
Lae'zel,The pupils themselves culled the weak from their ranks.
Lae'zel,Not every life is equal.
Lae'zel,Their lives were not precious. They were a blight that required expunging.
Lae'zel,Survival.
Lae'zel,My people have no use for cowards. Every trainee that I slayed was either too weak to withstand the lessons -
Lae'zel,- or was cocky enough to pick a fight they could never win.
Lae'zel,He would never have deigned to threaten a youngling. A waste of time and energy.
Lae'zel,Is there anything more we should discuss?
Lae'zel,I'll leave you to guess which piece I plan to start with. Now -
Lae'zel,"You know where I stand. And if you so much as smack your lips when I'm near, I will sever you piece by piece."
Lae'zel,"But if we stray too far that our chance is lost, I'll make my way there alone."
Lae'zel,"Very well, you may lead."
Lae'zel,I'll be waiting. Don't take long. 
Lae'zel,"If you want any hope of being rid of that infection, I suggest that you join me."
Lae'zel,Then I'll go there alone.
Lae'zel,"I expected more from you. If we stray too far, I'll make my way there alone."
Lae'zel,"Lead on, then."
Lae'zel,I have not failed you yet and I have no intentions of it now. I don't need you to believe me for it to be true.
Lae'zel,You don't have to trust them - only to trust me.
Lae'zel,"Githyanki writing. Every word a wheel, every letter a spoke."
Lae'zel,We must go there at once.
Lae'zel,Wait.
Lae'zel,To the Crèche Y'llek's command centre. Vlaakith must know of the heresy that's tainted the place.
Lae'zel,It'll have to wait until later.
Lae'zel,Impossible. I'm in battle.
Lae'zel,"You know what to do. When we next enter the Astral Prism, we will break Orpheus free."
Lae'zel,"For a thousand years, he waited. For a thousand years, he remained faithful to Gith and her royal spawn."
Lae'zel,"I will take the Orphic Hammer from Raphael, no matter the cost."
Lae'zel,"As for the renegade Voss, he waits in the sewers. He could prove an obstacle if we don't take his head."
Lae'zel,"Now send over your owner, before you make a mess of things."
Lae'zel,"Wrench the Orphic Hammer from Raphael's grasp and we can usher the prince to his doom, praise Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,The inquisitor has turned against my infallible queen.
Lae'zel,We must return to the crèche. I might contact Vlaakith from its command centre.
Lae'zel,Hurry. We are close to our cure.
Lae'zel,Voss - the godsdamned coward!
Lae'zel,"Voss is fallen, Vlaakith be praised!"
Lae'zel,"Since I was old enough to hold a blade, I've dreamt of wielding a silver sword."
Lae'zel,"The traitor Prince Orpheus will be next to fall - and the elder brain, after."
Lae'zel,Speak your mind. I'm listening.
Lae'zel,All glory be to Voss.
Lae'zel,"He will be known as an eternal Warrior of Legend. Not just by the githyanki, but by the psalmists and scholars of every plane."
Lae'zel,No matter - we will grant him a fate more torturous than death: the fall of his beloved Prince Orpheus.
Lae'zel,"We've come so far. You've a mighty will, that much is certain."
Lae'zel,There is no 'secret'. There is no plot.
Lae'zel,Tell me you don't trust it. Tell me you reject this abomination inside.
Lae'zel,"So be it. At least this time, you are truthful."
Lae'zel,I've drawn my limits. It would be a great pity for you should you cross them.
Lae'zel,"Let's consider the subject closed, shall we? Now - is there anything more to discuss?"
Lae'zel,"But so much as smack your lips when I'm near, and I will sever you piece by piece."
Lae'zel,It is to your benefit that you've proven yourself so useful in spite of your - condition.
Lae'zel,"But let me be clear: so much as smack your lips when I'm near, and I will sever you piece by piece."
Lae'zel,"Oh, good. I'd hate to see you subject yourself to my further mockery."
Lae'zel,"You've been keeping a secret, Astarion. And I don't like secrets."
Lae'zel,Your breath reeks of blood-iron. You slink like a darkling and preen like a parrot.
Lae'zel,"You had a choice, Astarion, and you failed me. But I'm not an unreasonable woman."
Lae'zel,And here I was hoping you'd embarrass yourself with some pathetic justification.
Lae'zel,"Since you'd deny me the entertainment, you'll make me a promise instead."
Lae'zel,"I'll let you live. I'll even let you keep the privilege of my alliance. In exchange, you'll keep your fangs away from me and anyone in our group."
Lae'zel,Am I understood?
Lae'zel,Do you think because I'm an outsider that that makes me ignorant?
Lae'zel,Greetings.
Lae'zel,I'll leave you to guess which piece I plan to start with. Am I understood?
Lae'zel,"But sweet as my blood is, it is not for the quaffing; luscious as my meat is, it is not to be dined on."
Lae'zel,I will prove to the undying regent that my faith is steadier than even the throne of skulls that she sits upon.
Lae'zel,"I will endure this test, and she will reward me."
Lae'zel,Then perhaps - perhaps you understand more than I thought.
Lae'zel,Do not mock me.
Lae'zel,Your constancy is... inspiring.
Lae'zel,Of course you are. I may be an outsider to these lands - but I am hardly ignorant of your kind.
Lae'zel,"So much as smack your lips when I'm near, and I will sever you piece by piece."
Lae'zel,Your breath reeks of blood-iron. You slink like a darkling and preen like a parrot. You wear your identity like a second skin.
Lae'zel,Well - I'm waiting.
Lae'zel,"No more lies, Astarion. These wounds you've branded me with tell your bloodthirsty tale."
Lae'zel,"No more lies, Astarion. The wounds you inflicted tell your bloodthirsty tale."
Lae'zel,So an undead slinks among us.
Lae'zel,"I am not averse to your kind, Astarion. Queen Vlaakith herself dwells in undeath, and she is no less revered for it - and no less alluring."
Lae'zel,"I suppose you can't be blamed. Sinewed muscles, sanguine flesh - I must be quite the temptation."
Lae'zel,I've half a mind to slit your neck for the secrecy. It is to your benefit that you've proven yourself so useful in spite of your - condition.
Lae'zel,Get up. You will not die today.
Lae'zel,"In my queen, I trust. One day soon she will honour me for it. She must."
Lae'zel,What's the secret to defeating the mind flayer empire then?
Lae'zel,Raphael must keep the Orphic Hammer in his so-called House of Hope.
Lae'zel,Voss is waiting. He should know we took the Orphic Hammer.
Lae'zel,"Speak with him, plead your case. If you won't, well - there's one more option, glory be to the Comet."
Lae'zel,"Speak with him, plead your case. If you won't, well - there's one more option, all glory to Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,"Not while Raphael's still in Sharess' Caress, it isn't."
Lae'zel,"Worse than Mephistopheles, the devil who slayed his own son, he whose experiments threaten to melt his own frozen throne?"
Lae'zel,"Why? Is he any worse than Asmodeus, do you suppose - The Reigning Serpent, he who harvests souls to fight an unwinnable Blood War?"
Lae'zel,The devil keeps the Orphic Hammer in his lair. We'll return to the House of Hope and take it.
Lae'zel,"First, to Voss. Then, to Raphael's House of Hope."
Lae'zel,Just don't expect a lavish spread awaiting us this time.
Lae'zel,"First, we kill Voss. Then, we go to the House of Hope."
Lae'zel,"I'll use it to smash the true heir's bonds, and then slice him open on the spot."
Lae'zel,"Now, to retrieve it."
Lae'zel,"The devil keeps the Orphic Hammer in his lair. If we can find a way in, we can take it."
Lae'zel,"Lucky for us we've another option, all glory to Vlaakith."
Lae'zel,"Don't be a fool. A broker is as bound by his contract as his buyer. The Hammer must be real, or Raphael could never take the Crown."
Lae'zel,We'll return to Raphael's lair. And we'll take the Orphic Hammer and smash Orpheus' bonds.
Lae'zel,We'll find a way into Raphael's lair. And we'll take the Orphic Hammer and smash Orpheus' bonds.
Lae'zel,We'll take the Orphic Hammer and use it to smash the true heir's bonds.
Lae'zel,We must speak with Voss. Then we return to Raphael's House of Hope.
Lae'zel,We must speak with Voss. Then we find our way to Raphael's House of Hope.
Lae'zel,I'm annoyed by it. And I admire you for it.
Lae'zel,"We'll return to Raphael's lair. And we'll take the Orphic Hammer, smash Orpheus' bonds, and slice him open."
Lae'zel,Vlaakith will reign eternal!
Lae'zel,"Vlaakith, ba na'zin. Vlaakith, ik sa'ith!"
Lae'zel,"We'll find a way into Raphael's lair. And we'll take the Orphic Hammer, smash Orpheus' bonds, and slice him open."
Lae'zel,"Lucky for us we've another option, glory be to the Comet."
Lae'zel,"First, we slay Voss, the traitor who seeks the end of Queen Vlaakith's glorious reign. Then we return to Raphael's House of Hope."
Lae'zel,"But we shouldn't regret the bargain, not for one instant. Raphael can have his crown, if it means breaking Prince Orpheus free."
Lae'zel,Devils are slippery creatures. They'd twist their tongues into knots to convince you a rockpile was mithril.
Lae'zel,"If you're such a threat to Her, why hasn't She killed you already? "
Lae'zel,"Let's get you out of here, out of Vlaakith's grasp. "
Lae'zel,"You claim to know a lot about my Queen, and yet you present no evidence. "
Lae'zel,I will not shirk my duty.
Lae'zel,Try to probe into the figure's mind. 
Lae'zel,Then let it be done. Prepare for death.
Lae'zel,Kneel in reverence to your queen.
Lae'zel,"Stay standing, exactly as you are."
Lae'zel,My queen. You honour me with your presence.
Lae'zel,Do as she asks. Kneel.
Lae'zel,Remain on your feet.
Lae'zel,You know me. How can it be?
Lae'zel,"The closer the elder brain, the closer we come to facing Orpheus in his own prison."
Lae'zel,Voss is waiting. It's time we end his misery.
Lae'zel,You've been appearing to me as Vlaakith. How?
Lae'zel,"Now, we can only wait. We'll free Orpheus when we next enter the Astral Prism."
Lae'zel,"Now, we can only wait. We'll slay Orpheus when we next enter the Astral Prism."
Lae'zel,Voss is waiting. He should know what happened with Raphael.
Lae'zel,"Now, to find our way in."
Lae'zel,Return to Raphael. We've no other choice.
Lae'zel,It will not be a pleasant reunion.
Lae'zel,"Either go to Raphael and hear him out, or tell Voss you've failed him and the githyanki people."
Lae'zel,"Either go to Raphael and hear him out, or tell Voss you've failed your own people."
Lae'zel,"There'd be too little to gain from our deaths, and too much to lose."
Lae'zel,The prince will be suspicious. But he won't be reckless enough to turn on his liberators.
Lae'zel,"Now, to the Sharess' Caress taproom. We must tell Voss the news."
Lae'zel,We can't allow him to keep it.
Lae'zel,"We'll take the Orphic Hammer, smash Orpheus' bonds, and slice him open on the spot."
Lae'zel,"First, we slay Voss, the traitor who seeks the end of Queen Vlaakith's glorious reign. Then we find our way to Raphael's House of Hope."
Lae'zel,The means to loosing the Prince of the Comet was within our grasp - and you refused it.
Lae'zel,"But I cannot forever abide your disrespect. Cross me too often, and you will face the coming madness without me."
Lae'zel,You are useful - for now. And we may yet find a way to gut the prince before he can fly free.
Lae'zel,"How fortunate for you that my obsession with you is so strong. Besides, I'm a practical woman."
Lae'zel,It's taking all my will not to take your head in her place.
Lae'zel,"I see no path to releasing Prince Orpheus, and no path to Vlaakith's demise."
Lae'zel,It's taking all my will not to take your head in his place.
Lae'zel,"I see no path to releasing the traitor prince, and no path to gutting him clean."
Lae'zel,Tsk'va! We have reached the abyss.
Lae'zel,How we get in remains to be seen.
Lae'zel,Voss stands at the ready. All that remains is to return to the Astral Prism and break Orpheus free.
Lae'zel,"When Thulla said to rescue her friends, I suppose she meant all of them. Waste of time, if you ask me."
Lae'zel,I've no care for these slaves. But explosives that powerful? Those could prove useful.
Lae'zel,Must you stick out your neck for every dimwit in distress?
Lae'zel,Wrench the Orphic Hammer from Raphael's grasp and we can free the Prince of the Comet.
Lae'zel,"To Baldur's Gate. If we're to be free of this parasite, we must slay these Chosen and their captive brain."
Lae'zel,I am waiting.
Lae'zel,Death.
Lae'zel,They will emerge from the shadows and descend from the skies. And we will grant them their only just fate:
Lae'zel,"Perhaps we may see them this eve. Look above, to the Sea of Night."
Lae'zel,Yes. Rocky bodies named after a false goddess.
Lae'zel,"Should you be fortunate, you may see Crèche K'liir tumble past."
Lae'zel,The Moonlantern. Not as theatrical as I expected.
Lae'zel,Broken. This might make passing the cursed lands... complicated.
Lae'zel,The light's been snuffed out. Only ash at the bottom.
Lae'zel,"Look above, to the Sea of Night."
Lae'zel,Extinguish the Tears? Your dedication to your goddess blinds you to their import.
Lae'zel,We must make for the crèche.
Lae'zel,Don't bother. You'd only subject us to her inevitable wailing.
Lae'zel,You are useful - for now. And we may yet find a way to loose the Comet and see him fly free.
Lae'zel,How fortunate for you that I'm a practical woman.
Lae'zel,Return to Raphael. We must hear him out.
Lae'zel,- and we slit his throat before he can utter another word against the Undying Queen.
Lae'zel,"We meet him in the Sharess' Caress taproom, just as he asked -"
Lae'zel,"When the opportunity comes, we'll return to the Prism. Until then, keep the Hammer close."
Lae'zel,"Now, to the Sharess' Caress taproom. I mean to crush the slithering snake we call Voss."
Lae'zel,"But a broker is as bound by his contract as his buyer. The Hammer must be real, or Raphael could never have the Crown."
Lae'zel,Ask Wyll. He knows that better than anyone.
Lae'zel,"You know that better than anyone, Wyll."
Lae'zel,Devil's are slippery creatures. They'd twist their tongues into knots to convince you a rockpile was mithril.
Lae'zel,You're right to question.
Lae'zel,"The closer the elder brain, the closer we come to killing Orpheus in his own astral prison."
Lae'zel,The Emperor can't shut us out forever.
Lae'zel,"But we shouldn't regret the bargain, not for one instant. Raphael can have his crown, if it means breaking Orpheus free and slicing him open."
Lae'zel,I'd sooner have imagined shattering a planet with my bare fist than taking a deal with a devil.
Lae'zel,The means to do so was within our grasp - and you refused it.
Lae'zel,We cannot slay the traitor prince unless we loose him from his astral prison.
Lae'zel,All that remains is to return to the Astral Prism and break Orpheus free.
Lae'zel,Each raider I fell will bring me closer to my queen.
Lae'zel,"Attacking at night? Cowardly, if expected from desperate sellswords."
Lae'zel,What's a few coins? The sister won't miss them.
Lae'zel,We must speak of recent events.
Lae'zel,Make it brief.
Lae'zel,I'm listening.
Lae'zel,But it's got a vicious bite to it. Delightful.
Lae'zel,"I expected Baldur's Gate to be insipid, stale, wholly without merit."
Lae'zel,This must be activated elsewhere.
Lae'zel,Vlaakith tests my might and my nerve. I will prove to her that my weapon is keen and my muscles are strong. 
Lae'zel,This is all wrong. Queen Vlaakith would never lie to Her people. 
Lae'zel,Let's get you out of here before she finds out I let you live. 
Lae'zel,Return to Raphael. He holds the key that would unleash the traitor prince.
Lae'zel,There is no third axiom.
Lae'zel,It's a truth. The third truth. Of the Maltbianblake spell. Obviously.
Lae'zel,Launch into a lengthy monologue using the biggest words you know.
Lae'zel,I don't know.
Lae'zel,I'm no Vlaakith loyalist. Let's get you out of here.
Minsc,"And I am confused. She is not with us at this very moment, no - but she's around the city somewhere."
Minsc,"Aha! Jaheira has left you some tasks while she was away, Jord?"
Minsc,"That it has! Minsc once idled away a century in stone, but he and Boo have been busy in these months since we parted."
Minsc,"You! Boo would have caught your foul scent, had you not confounded his nose with evil Sharran incense."
Minsc,It is true. Boo has slain many who have greeted him so impolitely.
Minsc,"Alas, poor Florrick... I have no idea who that is."
Minsc,"Boo is moved to tears at the beauty of these words, Jaheira."
Minsc,"But now Minsc knows the number. The number is none, because Baldur's Gate is my home, and it will not fall while Minsc and Boo still stand."
Minsc,"Minsc could never count as high as Boo, so the number of steps soon became too large for him to hold in his head. Too large and too sad."
Minsc,Boo and I - we prayed it would be Orin who prevailed. It would make the slaughter to come a little gentler.
Minsc,"Up...? Most recently, a long and winding stairway - to the High Hall!"
Minsc,Hah! See how your very presence snatches the breath from his chest? And it is no wonder!
Minsc,Nor will Minsc! Again.
Minsc,As will I. Jaheira tells me a debt is owed - even if my heart and hamster do not understand it.
Minsc,"Huh. Plant a bad man in the soil, and out grows a better one. Perhaps Jaheira has taught me something."
Minsc,"It is well that Minsc had no hamster for your sticky fingers to find. When Boo buries a villain, they stay that way."
Minsc,"Are we so faithless? As you wish - while we watch over you, Boo shall be watching over us."
Minsc,Even I could have told you - this was a silly thing to say.
Minsc,"Aha, Jaheira's old weapons! They look strong as ever. Minsc should know - they gave him many bruises over the years."
Minsc,Now DIE!
Minsc,"You thought you could do such monstrous things, and Minsc would not know? The tadpole has tattled."
Minsc,VILLAINY! Boo will kill me before he lets me become a tool of evil once more. 
Minsc,"And for this, you will need Boo. He has tasted Bhaalspawn flesh before - and he would not mind another bite."
Minsc,"It would be like swinging a sword by the wrong side. Painful - but it can be effective, too."
Minsc,But not yours alone to walk. 
Minsc,"Well, you cannot understand Boo's wisdom. So I suppose we must listen to Jaheira instead."
Minsc,"I think you are still dreaming if you see a dagger before you. She has a sword - two of them, in fact."
Minsc,"If there is still good in you - find it quickly, says Boo. Or the next time we meet, you will know my rage."
Minsc,Sarevok once had his chance to taste of goodness - but he spat it back out. Now he may taste boot-leather instead.
Minsc,"Boo did this because he knows the heart of Minsc, and he knew that a part of it was all those many steps behind us. In Rashemen. At home."
Minsc,"There was a time when my hamster counted every bootprint that I left behind me, whether it was in snow, mud, or evil's backside. "
Minsc,"While you wriggled 'neath the city's soil like the worm that you are. It will please my hamster to kill you twice, Sarevok."
Minsc,THERE YOU ARE!
Minsc,"On closer inspection, Boo, this clown does not much look like the jolly sort..."
Minsc,Then I shall brush out Boo's fur - for we are going a-visiting.
Minsc,"A puzzle, is it? Boo is most adept at their solving - no matter where Minsc hides the nuts, Boo is always able to sniff them out!"
Minsc,"The nuts are in my pocket, wizard. Please do not go patting at Minsc's person."
Minsc,"Bah, Boo does not believe your bitter words! "
Minsc,"You stepped through the dusty one's portal willingly enough, no? And without Minsc even there to toss you!"
Minsc,"'WITHOUT' tadpoles, Boo! Forgive my hamster's squirrelishness."
Minsc,"He has developed something of a taste for tadpole, and is displeased with the diet I have been forced to place him on."
Minsc,"No no, my friend, do not begin this! It is too early in the evening for tears, and passing Boo around for the blowing of noses."
Minsc,"First, I must educate this sneak-thief on the company he keeps."
Minsc,"Do not look, Boo. It is no longer our friend who stands there."
Minsc,Boo knows many gods. You don't look like any of them.
Minsc,And Minsc shall be your undoing! 
Minsc,You can lie to Minsc. Perhaps even to Jaheira. But not to Boo.
Minsc,Boo and I - we once hoped that that was true. But no longer.
Minsc,AAAAAAAARRRRGGGGGH!
Minsc,"These large numbers, they wrinkle Minsc's brow and bring a soreness to his skull. Make them smaller, please."
Minsc,Jaheira... must it truly be this way?
Minsc,"Boo and Minsc promise to make it swift, evil."
Minsc,"Jaheira hoped there was still some flimsy light of good within you, small as Boo but just as bright."
Minsc,"Do not fret, little banker. Minsc has no need of your services. Boo holds all our valuables in his little cheeks."
Minsc,"Ah, you speak of the Stone Lord? No, no - he only looked, sounded, and quite possibly smelled exactly like Minsc."
Minsc,"A needful sniff, perhaps? So you know I am no impostor?"
Minsc,We have already smashed Sarevok's soul from his body once. Boo says it is your turn.
Minsc,What? I was trying to spy a nice warm spot for Boo's bedding.
Minsc,"We have slain kings. And gods. And one time, a giant. But never before a friend."
Minsc,So. We are not agreed on whether we will return here and feed you to a mimic - yet.
Minsc,"Ugh. A stinking den of dregs and - ooh, is that Rashemi firewine?!"
Minsc,"On the one hand, you are clearly evil, and deserving of a mouthful of righteous knuckle."
Minsc,"You have been the subject of many wrinkled brows between my hamster and I, Saer Banker-Beard."
Minsc,"We have slain queens. And gods. And one time, a giant. But never before a friend."
Minsc,I -! 
Minsc,Jaheira - no! NOOOO!
Minsc,"A cure for your heart! Karlach, do you know what this means? Soon, your heart will be cured!"
Minsc,"HAH, THAT IS OUR FRIEND! BOO WISHES TO SEE THE TRICK WITH THE KNIVES!"
Minsc,Your troubles have been many. But Boo believes choppy seas make a skilled swimmer especially when you have a paddle-mate at your side!
Minsc,"Away, my friend! Minsc shall soon strip, and Boo would not see you blinded."
Minsc,"And turnips. But you are no turnip. Let that be of comfort, in your final moments."
Minsc,"This leathered balloon is bound. Helpless. If there must be blood spilled on this floor, Boo has some better ideas of who it should belong to."
Minsc,"Our friend is not like you were, Sarevok. When Boo speaks to her of goodness, she does not get that stupid, soon-to-sneeze look on her face, as you used to."
Minsc,"Our friend is not like you were, Sarevok. When Boo speaks to him of goodness, he does not get that stupid, soon-to-sneeze look on his face, as you used to."
Minsc,"Our friend is not like you were, Sarevok. When Boo speaks to them of goodness, they does not get that stupid, soon-to-sneeze look on their face, as you used to."
Minsc,"Minsc does the doing, Boo the reasoning why - and he need not explain our noble cause to you, smooth-skull."
Minsc,"Boo will leave your innards unfeasted on for now, Sarevok, but only to leave room for the villains who actually matter."
Minsc,If there is one thing Minsc hates more than beasts with bad breath - 
Minsc,- it is those who are tricksome with the truth. 
Minsc, Sex scene. 
Minsc,"Sex is optional, but if your origin does have sex in this scene, please set these object flags: ORI_HadSexWithRufus AND ORI_HadSexWithCompanion, as these are checked elsewhere. Thank you!"
Minsc, Pillow talk. 
Minsc,Your troubles have been many. But Boo believes choppy seas make a skilled  sailor. It is why he requires Minsc to swim in the Sea of Swords each day at dawn!
Minsc,"Minsc had his doubts about you, little Slayer, but Boo had none!"
Minsc,"If this fine music continues, Boo might take to dancing."
Minsc,"Here, Boo - store some in your cheeks. Better than Zhentish prison fare, is it not?"
Minsc,Then better you do not know.
Minsc,Hm. Those pantaloons - have you brought another pair?
Minsc,"No, Boo! We must treat Happy with kindness - how else will he learn what it is to be a hero?"
Minsc,"Do you see, Happy? When a true victory is won, the rewards are delicious!"
Minsc,"For one so fleshless of form, Withers is well-versed in the preparing of meat."
Minsc,It is well for you that you are correct.
Minsc,You have shown us the colour of your blood. Boo wonders if we had been wiser to spill it on the ground.
Minsc,Flattery! A thing for fools and the false of heart!
Minsc,I would prefer to stoop over Sarevok's corpse.
Minsc,"Order, and Minsc obeys. As if Boo himself commanded."
Minsc,Minsc politely declines your offer to be an offering. I am afraid he is already claimed by Boo.
Minsc,Let us pave our own path. Starting with the kicked buttocks of that one there.
Minsc,Simple. We beat him about the brow and butt until he was dead.
Minsc,"As you say, Jaheira."
Minsc,There is no gold in here. 
Minsc,You have been keeping busy! Boo is glad to hear a hero of your calibre has not been sitting idle - or alone.
Minsc,"Claws to the fore, Boo! Something makes Minsc's hair stand on end..."
Minsc,"What? Check yourself, if you do not believe me!"
Minsc,"Boo! Is it you who fritters about so frighteningly? If you wish to dance, then Minsc will set you down."
Minsc,Hrrrrrraaaagh!
Minsc,"Die, says the Absolute!"
Minsc,"Sword, boot - evil will taste both!"
Minsc,"You cannot defeat the Absolute. You can only wail, and die!"
Minsc,Hang on! Minsc is on his way!
Minsc,"Where are you?! Squeak, so I might know you are well!"
Minsc,"Do not thank us, friend. It is not as if we didn't consider killing you instead."
Minsc,STORIES!
Minsc,Have you ever fought with a talking sword?
Minsc,"Yes! A mighty blade, but a mouthy one, too. I wonder what happened to it."
Minsc,Leave the future for hathrans and hamsters to divine. We speak only of this moment.
Minsc,"No game. A serious matter, to rouse Boo from his beauty sleep."
Minsc,Boo remembers the scent of Bhaalspawn. Like rot on the tongue - meaning no offence.
Minsc,Rodent...?
Minsc,You have been keeping busy! Boo is glad to hear a hero of your calibre has not been sitting idle.
Minsc,"We do not loom, friend. We tread soft and sure as hunting hamsters."
Minsc,"Mourn, Boo - weep! The parasite has finally eaten our friend's brain!"
Minsc,A level head and a kind heart. It is well that Boo kept me from crushing either.
Minsc,There is someone you must meet.
Minsc,...Jaheira? I... do not understand.
Minsc,"What...? Jaheira, you look a little... strangesome..."
Minsc,AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGH!
Minsc,RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Minsc,...Where is he?!
Minsc,He is... he is... 
Minsc,"Flop all you wish, little fish - but Minsc has caught you."
Minsc,Ah. Well. Perhaps I only needed to sneeze.
Minsc,Some sneak-thief lurks nearby. The same one I sensed in the Counting House.
Minsc,Killed... her...
Minsc,"Jaheira! You have an evil, much uglier twin sister? Minsc does not like this!"
Minsc,"Though I am thinking yours does not sit on your shoulders, eh? Ah, you are right Boo! That is... none of Minsc's business."
Minsc,"Aha, the lovebirds still nest together, then? Minsc is glad - for what is life without a companion?"
Minsc,Boo will save you a dance.
Minsc,"We shall conclude our business with the thief - but have no fear, my friend."
Minsc,"What is reuniting with old comrades, if not the stuff of dreams? But Minsc is full-clothed, so this must be no vision!"
Minsc,Release this man at once!
Minsc,"...Boo? Does our friend know another Minsc? One that they might be courting, perhaps?"
Minsc,"Minsc is flattered, but surely you must know that his heart is already of the hamster shape. And twice as fuzzy."
Minsc,Boo will remind him of the details later - he has the memory of a miniature giant space elephant.
Minsc,Boo suggests that a 'hello' is more traditional.
Minsc,"I come clothed in blood, sweat and the tears of my foes! What better attire for a hero?"
Minsc,"What else but the stuff of songs, my friend? "
Minsc,"This pond shall do nicely, Boo. Though I see no soap - so you shall have to blow the bubbles for me..."
Minsc,"There is much merriment to be made before the night is done. Go, and greet the others - Minsc shall make himself presentable."
Minsc,Silly Vlaakith! What would one undying know about the dealing of death?
Minsc,This man is no enemy of the people! This man could not even hurt a mouse! I know - I have seen him try! 
Minsc,"No no, my friend! It is not yet time for tears, and passing Boo around for the wiping of eyes!"
Minsc,"He has developed something of a taste for tadpole, and is displeased by the diet I have placed him on. But no better cure than the company of friends!"
Minsc,"Bah, Boo does not believe your bitter words!"
Minsc,"You are wise, Boo. Let us... give her a moment."
Minsc,"Boo thinks you will not be long in reminding her how to die, hm?"
Minsc,"Aha! You see, Boo? I told you our friend was near!"
Minsc,"The Watcher tightens what? Whatever it be, Minsc will knock it loose."
Minsc,Volo?
Minsc,Volothamp Geddarm?
Minsc,"Breathe deep, Boo! The smell of hero sings from every stone in this place!"
Minsc,"We awoke in a Zhentish cell, awaiting trial by noble combat! Ah - 'execution', says Boo, though... I am not sure of the difference?"
Minsc,In ample time indeed! So long as the bone-mage returns us to our cell by dawn. Boo would not be late to the bloodshed.
Minsc,Minsc and Boo agree. To disagree.
Minsc,"The Zhent may keep their peace, so long as Minsc may keep his steel. We shall see which is the first to shatter, hm?"
Minsc,...She told Minsc and Boo to behave themselves - which is why we shall be back in our cell by dawn.
Minsc,"But leave such matters for the morn! Tonight is for celebration, and telling of tales!"
Minsc,"How have you filled your days, since we tore the sticky tyrant from the sky?"
Minsc,"It is a long walk to the gallows and Minsc still has his fists, no?"
Minsc,Karlach? You are... well?
Minsc,"To meet again where your journey began, my friend - an honour. For Minsc and his hamster both."
Minsc,"He is not a guest, but your newest follower!"
Minsc,Minsc would not presume to ask if any miniature giant space hamsters have joined your menagerie. You would have mentioned by now if a friend for Boo were found.
Minsc,"Minsc shares in your mission, friend - you pursue fiends from outside the city's walls, and Minsc will rout them from within. "
Minsc,"Minsc has known Shadowheart for some time, and so feels permitted to say - getting to know her is a rocky road, but one well worth the walking."
Minsc,"Like two brawnsome vipers we will be, striking at the heel and head of villainy!"
Minsc,Shadowheart has no need for any of Viconia's educating. She is sinister enough by herself - and our ally all the same.
Minsc,"Ah, Sorcerous Sundries. Gale would be giddy as a wizard in a magic shop."
Minsc,"Compromise! Like when Boo wants to himself a turkey leg entire, and Minsc must be content with a hamster-sized wing instead."
Minsc,"But it is this night still - and a night for celebration, no less!"
Minsc,"You have a better head for such things than most, old friend. May Baldur's Gate flow over with fried poultry under your reign!"
Minsc,"Spreading her infection, you mean. Lady Loss is like a wound left to rot - and the day may come when Minsc and Boo must scratch."
Minsc,"Exactly! Her heart would be cured! When this day comes, you must come and bunk with Minsc and Boo."
Minsc,"Oh Boo, do you know what it would mean - to find a cure for Karlach's heart?"
Minsc,Oh. Boo suggests a variety of arcane remedies. But love - love is the most potent! And by far the easiest to pronounce.
Minsc,"A powerful pairing. If love cannot cure a vampire, what can?"
Minsc,"We shall aid you, friend vampire. Tonight for the dancing and the dining, and tomorrow for the dark lord's just desserts."
Minsc,He still lives? A dark blotch upon our banquet-cloth this night. One we must patch until it is all hamster hair and heroism!
Minsc,"My hamster thought you might stray from the path, but Minsc always bets upon his friends. Keep it up, and Boo will have ne'er a coin left in his little cheeks!"
Minsc,We will be no one's fleshy vessel. Not again!
Minsc,It is just this day that Happy learned of your legend - while we gazed down upon the very city you saved.<br>
Minsc,Ugh. Minsc would rather crack his own skull than let it be some squishy illithid plaything. What other perversions does this elder brain commit?
Minsc,"Minsc hears the determination rattle your cry, even if he can't remember who is the Comet and who the lich queen."
Minsc,"The Guild should not go creeping in high places if they do not have the stomach for them, hm?"
Minsc,It is well for Happy the strange portal appeared when it did. Minsc's arm was growing achesome.
Minsc,"Oh. And for Happy, also."
Minsc,So I have! Though it is a peace made more from blade and boot than it is any sense of brotherhood.
Minsc,"Nine-Fingers forbade any looting of the illithid's fleshy vessels - and so Minsc guards what remains of the battle-site, even from her."
Minsc,"Boo thinks you are grown swollen on your own importance, bloodsucker. Mind you do not give him cause to go a-squishing, yes?"
Minsc,"Boo and I toasted your victory when we heard! If you could have seen his tiny paws clasping his thimble of ale, you would have been double-pleased, old friend."
Minsc,"I don't know much, old friend, but I do know this: What Astarion wants, Astarion gets."
Minsc,Except for those many covetous glances you once threw at Boo. 
Minsc,"Did you hear that, Boo? Minsc has won the wager!"
Minsc,"As Minsc hunts the fiends inside the city walls, so does Wyll hunt the devils outside them! Let us meet in the middle for a hearty toast before long - Boo's treat!"
Minsc,"When this day comes, you must come and bunk with Minsc and Boo!"
Minsc,Karlach? You are well...?
Minsc,The Zhentarim rule the city's underbelly - so Minsc and Boo went to give them a tickle. There were harsh words. Battle-cries. Some manner of... head-wound?
Minsc,"Shadowheart! Two gods tugged at her soul, but she managed to keep it for all herself in the end. Wait, Boo - did she do something with her hair...?"
Minsc,"Halsin, Archdruid of Arch...somewhere. He is a much better man than he smells."
Minsc,"And there - the champion of... having tentacles! Karlach! (She once was very tall and strong, like Minsc, but we still like her as she is.)"
Minsc,"And there - the champion of the Hells herself. Karlach Demonsbane! Devilsbane! Myrkul-, Bhaal- and Bane-bane!"
Minsc,"'Punished'...? That is meaning more than a spanking, in a place such as this."
Minsc,"The true Ravengard still lives within. If Minsc could be freed from his fleshy prison, then so can the Duke!"
Minsc,My friend...? MY FRIEND! Now is no time for the napping!
Minsc,"You would betray Dame Aylin? Be you faithless, or simply foolish?"
Minsc,"You would betray Dame Aylin? Be you faithless, or simply foolish?<br>"
Minsc,I will admit I have not listened to a single thing the ginger wizard has said. But I do not like the way he says it.
Minsc,"Once the Guild is made of goodness once more, Boo shall scratch the hells wide open and find a way to bring her back!"
Minsc,"And there is... an absence. Karlach, who would have been the heart of this celebration, had she not lost her heart in turn."
Minsc,"Saving your city was her last act in this life. Which is why Minsc will make sure the Guild honours her, yes?"
Minsc,"Study them well, sneak-thief - for the best among them will be a guide for your Guild. Heroes, who put the city before themselves. Who never falter in their duty. And, more than this..."
Minsc,Who never arrive to a party without even a gift for the host.
Minsc,What? I was not - did we win?
Minsc,Gortash wanted this stone. If we must give it to him... may we wrap it in a fist?
Minsc,YES!<br>
Minsc,"Gale, the man-who-would-be-god, but chose-to-die-a-hero-instead. This smiling shimmering thing is but a poor copy, sent to ease our aching hearts."
Minsc,"Shadowheart, foul Sharran. Trust no woman who makes an enemy of the moon."
Minsc,Not even for Boo?!
Minsc,"Hah! Not without a companion, I'm afraid. Boo will ask some of his sewer-dwelling friends!"
Minsc,"The titles matter not. Only this - when Minsc does as Minsc does, and charges in to make a mess:"
Minsc,"(We visit with him much down in the dark places, though he often moves his lair without remembering to tell Minsc where.)"
Minsc,"But... this is where Minsc falls short of the understanding, Jaheira. "
Minsc,"Jaheira... Boo is trying his best to explain, but I still do not understand your anger."
Minsc,An evil end...
Minsc,"And Minthara. Yes. She is here, also. Repenting of her wicked ways and performing charitable acts, no doubt!"
Minsc,"My friend? Are you hurt? Show us where you are wounded, so that we might help!"
Minsc,"Go, my friend. Be among our friends - there is much work yet to be done before this one is fit to join them."
Minsc,"Boo is enjoying this chasing of Chosen. Let us find the last, so he might take another trophy."
Minsc,It is well that Boo's innocent ears still ring from all this shouting.
Minsc,"Keep a close guard on that ambition, friend wizard, and do not spread those wings too wide."
Minsc,"Astarion, who is banished by the sun itself for fear his spawnish soul might outshine it!"
Minsc,"Lae'zel, of Creche Killer! True Child of Gith and true friend to Boo - though she will 'CHK!' and say it is not so."
Minsc,"Minsc and Boo have been helping, of course! We guard the streets while Jaheira is occupied with Harperish matters."
Minsc,"Boo had a moment to lick himself clean, but there is a little too much of Minsc to cover."
Minsc,"Minsc has heard that a mage must go thick-bearded, so all his wisdom might live in one place. Yet our company is more of the wisp and whiskers, no...?"
Minsc,"*SQUEAK!* Ai, Boo, come now. See how our friend trembles? You have taken the jest too far."
Minsc,"Oho, Boo - a challenge! I cannot let this go unanswered. One... two..."
Minsc,"You will forgive the aroma, I hope. We were not expecting the dusty one to open a portal to our very cell! "
Minsc,BOO! WE ARE NOT DREAMING! IT IS OUR OLD FRIEND!
Minsc,"Beg pardon. But there is naught so bracing as a good battle-roar, do you not agree?"
Minsc,Even the softest of boot leather can betray the overzealous adventurer. My toes know all too well - Boo can attest to much ignoble squealing around campfires past.
Minsc,"Ah, and you wish Minsc to come and tell your students of the adventurer's road? An honour!"
Minsc,AAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
Minsc,"Smells like fish. I like fish, but only when cooked."
Minsc,"The githyanki must meet many giant space hamsters, but I bet they have ever seen one as small as Boo!"
Minsc,"Sorry if you heard me and Boo arguing. He says to love is better than to fight, and I cannot agree!"
Minsc,One Minsc will refuse. To be trapped in a room full of fresh-faced wizards... no. Better that Boo does it.
Minsc,"We shall discuss his fee once our fun is had this night, hm?"
Minsc,"And yet you still make it sound so boring. Truly, God-Gale, Minsc is glad to see you have not changed one bit!"
Minsc,The wrinkled orb is correct! Boo remembers the stench of the temple still.
Minsc,"Wyll Ravengard, the Blade of Frontiers. Devil-horned, and angel-hearted!"
Minsc,"If they be innocent, they deserve life. If they be not - death. This hanging about in between... it is uncommon cruel."
Minsc,"Fly, little vampires! Return to this city, and you will answer to BOO!"
Minsc,Boo has been admiring the sheen of goo upon your slimely form. He says it twinkles in the starlight.
Minsc,"Hah, you are quite coated in hamster-hair! Now wherever you go, Boo goes too."
Minsc,"What are we seeing, Boo? This cannot be our doing - can it?"
Minsc,"And should you feel a squirming, know that it is only Boo. Or perhaps the buffet has gone bad."
Minsc,"EMBRACE ME, MY FRIEND!"
Minsc,"Nothing special!? If that is so, then Boo is naught but a brown and base rodent. "
Minsc,"But should you meet a Red Wizard, remember - you may have conquered your bloodline, but there is no shame in a small and sensible amount of murder."
Minsc,Minsc has wondered how that sad-mouthed Graycloak and flighty Aerie have fared. And whether Jan ever built his turnip-cannon.
Minsc,"Ah, Minsc knows these rituals well! He had to give them up on meeting Boo - there is only so much hamster hair one man can swallow."
Minsc,"But I ask - should Boo send you prayers, answer not.  For his ambitions to be realised... the world is not ready for such things."
Minsc,"Careful! No matter how stealthy you are, a squirrel will always know when you have stolen his nuts. Boo has learned this, at great cost."
Minsc,I have already pledged my sword and hamster both. What more does Minsc have to give?
Minsc,The Iron Throne building. Plunked into the waters like the great festering turd that it is.
Minsc,Checking.
Minsc,"Eh, Boo has said it is unkind to speak behind the backs of some of our companions."
Minsc,"But Minsc, of course, will translate."
Minsc,"So small is Boo that he is often mistaken for a pinecone, and many secrets are spoken in his hearing! He will tell what he knows."
Minsc,"Minsc and Boo are of one mind, and one heart. And Boo is the wiser."
Minsc,"You hear that, Boo? Your keen skills of observation have not gone unnoticed! Our friend wishes to consult your wisdom."
Minsc,"Sword, axe, boot... Minsc once choked an ogre with its own loincloth. The smell might be the closest I have come to tasting of death myself."
Minsc,"The sword is simpler - only one point, so you know which end the evil goes on! But I suppose a warrior must wield whatever weapon he can."
Minsc,"Danthelon's Dancing Axe...? Minsc would sooner fight with a sword - even an annoying one, which talks out of turn."
Minsc,Minsc has felt Boo's heart is fluttering faster than usual... for our friend the Blade is betrothed.
Minsc,"Ahh, this makes more sense! Some relation to the Baldur who owns the gate perhaps, Boo?"
Minsc,Who is this large man of sternness and stone? Boo mislikes his look - as if he is knowing things that Minsc is not.
Minsc,All it does is make Minsc wonder if Boo has already eaten this villain's eyes. 
Minsc,Boo is ready with the musings.
Minsc,"With this in mind - Minsc thinks he has gathered enough fluff from gazing at his navel for the moment, no?"
Minsc,"Buck up, says Boo!"
Minsc,"...No, Boo, I do not know what this has to do with the bears..."
Minsc,"He was turned from a red squirrel to a grey, all by one shocking sight. Minsc thinks you owe him an apology."
Minsc,"Boo has been speaking to a certain squirrel-friend who frequents our camp, Halsin."
Minsc,"Gather the sparking sticks, Boo! With sword in one hand and these in the other, we need truck with wizards no more!"
Minsc,"Bah. Boo says the many colours remind him of home, but Minsc has never enjoyed these fireworks."
Minsc,Minsc sometimes wishes he was small as Boo - so that he might sit and listen to the storytellers in peace.
Minsc,Umberlee - her clerics possess a nasty streak as wide as her oceans.
Minsc,"Obliged, wizard. Should we find our way to a weaponsmith, Minsc will rough you up a little - so that you too can fit in."
Minsc,Minsc has never trusted places such as this. Too much of a wizard's power can be simply packaged and picked up.
Minsc,"Oh, no! Most warriors of Rashemen wear long battle-braids, weighed down with stone. Minsc can show you, when next we camp?"
Minsc,"Gale. Minsc worries you might send a fireball up his butt, with all of this stringy hair in your face."
Minsc,Gale! You will perhaps able to explain where Boo has not - what exactly is the difference between a devil and a demon?
Minsc,"Yes, vampire?"
Minsc,"No, Boo. Astarion is a friend now - he would never bite you."
Minsc,"Oh, the pale scoundrel has his charms, it cannot be denied. But, my friend, it gives me no pleasure to tell you - Astarion is not what he claims to be."
Minsc,"Just last night, Minsc was dressing one of his many heroic wounds in camp - when Astarion stumbled upon the scene."
Minsc,"I tell you, he grew pale as death itself. He licked his lips, and trembled so violently that Minsc thought he might faint on the spot!"
Minsc,...Just one moment.
Minsc,Ahem. My hamster has not given you leave to die.
Minsc,"Shall I poke the wound some more, to make sure that it is healed?"
Minsc,Would a little nibble from Boo help to move you along...?
Minsc,"Still this patter of paws, Boo - we must be quiet."
Minsc,"Butt-level, all the better for the kicking."
Minsc,"My hamster, he will whisper words of wisdom to you."
Minsc,I could not have said it better myself.
Minsc,I do not wish to speak of the wizard.
Minsc,"Hah - well, may he answer to the archdevil herself, and may all her questions be hot pokers pressed against his flesh!"
Minsc,"Karlach remains Karlach. Even if all of her parts were traded for tin and scrap, Minsc thinks this would still be so."
Minsc,I would never think to mock! She is as fine a warrior as any I've met - Mazzy Fentan stretched two spans tall!
Minsc,"Just as Karlach has always been Karlach. Even if all her parts were traded for tin and scrap, Minsc thinks this would still be so."
Minsc,"Indeed! A berserker after my own heart. Though hers is made of hellish heat, and metal, and... some manner of coin-operated device?"
Minsc,There is room for us all - biting fleas astride the great buttocks of evil!
Minsc,"Do not look into his eyes, Boo! Think not of nesting in his thick and downy mane!"
Minsc,What need for jealousy? Villainy's backside is ample and vast.
Minsc,Ohoho! Minsc would need a title to match - something to wash away the Stone Lord's stain.
Minsc,'Mizora'. Perhaps she and Boo will be friends.
Minsc,"If there be a devil on his shoulder, then Minsc and Boo will sit astride the other! He will not be long in coming back to himself, I think."
Minsc,"Boo speaks sense, as ever. There is goodness in Wyll - we have seen it. "
Minsc,"Jaheira did her part, of course, but she prefers to scowl from the shadows. The city needs a name - a face! Preferably, a furry companion too."
Minsc,It is good to know the city did not go unprotected while I wore pigeon droppings on the Wide.
Minsc,"Ah, the great Blade of Frontiers! A fine name - Minsc has no idea what it means, but it suits young Wyll's air of mystery well."
Minsc,"If the sun can bear to look upon Astarion's monstrous face, then so can Minsc and Boo! For now, at least."
Minsc,"It is good that we do not have any friends who could ever be mistaken for a rat, eh, Boo?"
Minsc,"I fear my hamster has the right of it, as always. But fear not."
Minsc,"This world is a strange and wondrous place. Minsc has seen the soul of an angel in a child of Bhaal. Once, even a kind banker. "
Minsc,"Minsc has met many vampires, and never one whose smile did not hide treacherous teeth. But... as you say."
Minsc,Minsc may have been mistaken. Boo presents compelling evidence that Astarion may in fact be a vampire.
Minsc,You are sure? And you could not have told me this before?
Minsc,"The Boot of Backsides, perhaps? Or - "
Minsc,"Be well, says Boo!"
Minsc,ASTARION! FISH! ASTARION!
Minsc,"You might have your cloudy locks to keep the heat off your head, but do not forget that Minsc has Boo! We will be like twins, eh?"
Minsc,"There is more than a little to know, I think. I am huge."
Minsc,"Minsc is an open book, with many pretty pictures."
Minsc,"You pulled Minsc from the Absolute's hateful hands, and delivered him back into those of his hamster."
Minsc,We are the best of friends! Comrades in arms! Companions in common cause! This is what you mean?
Minsc,"Ah. You dart from one thing to another like Boo when he has supped on sugar. But I am glad you have raised this matter, for it has much been on the mind of Minsc also. "
Minsc,"Minsc is not the den mother, to deny his campmates their under-the-blankets business. But rest is important, and all our sweaty strength might be best directed at the cult."
Minsc,"Or, at the very least, taken far outside of my hamster's hearing. I will say no more on the matter."
Minsc,"And he is a little protective of his territory, eh? Minsc thinks you will sleep more soundly in your own bed."
Minsc,"And, if Minsc may be so bold - none of this funny under-the-covers business with any of our fellows. We must save our sweaty strength for the Absolute, eh?"
Minsc,Aw. Do you see? This is the manner of compliment that only good friends pay to one another!
Minsc,"Feet light as feathers, and softer than Boo's."
Minsc,"As thanks, Minsc shall take first watch when we sleep this night! Rest well, my friend."
Minsc,"Well. In many ways, it is the very opposite of this city. The far side of Faerûn, with empty plains, white forests, and peaks that pierce the very belly of the sky!"
Minsc,"The telthors: guardian spirits of every root, rock, and tree. Here in the Sleeping Lands they are silent - but in the far north, they know how to speak still."
Minsc,"Such a sceptic, my friend! Minsc cannot prove the point to you, for the telthors of this land lie sleeping - and for this, we had best be glad. "
Minsc,If my meaning is not clear... just check under your boot.
Minsc,"As you know, he stumbled at the first step... protecting his witch."
Minsc,"After wandering a ways, and some savings of the Sword Coast, Minsc returned to Rashemen. To find a welcome fit for hamsters and heroes!"
Minsc,"Minsc politely disagreed. Dynaheir was dead, and so his dajemma could never be done."
Minsc,"'Then swear your service to me, Minsc of Rashemen,' said he. 'Serve your land as your lord's chosen champion!'"
Minsc,See how the hamster stalks his prey.
Minsc,Just tell me when to shout my battle cry.
Minsc,A berserker's knees are not made for all this bending.
Minsc,"Minsc politely disagreed. It was a little awkward, but he had already sworn his service to Boo."
Minsc,'Minsc of Rashemen!' said he. 'You insult your Iron Lord - we will settle this matter in the circle of combat!'
Minsc,It was only polite for Minsc to agree. 
Minsc,"After they carried the Iron Lord away, the council of witches gave Minsc a pack of provisions, and said it would be best if he continued his adventures for a time."
Minsc,As you wish. Boo? Do you have much to say on the matter of 'something else'?
Minsc,Because it is slow and stupid and sleeping. Ah - Boo says Minsc should phrase this in a kinder fashion.
Minsc,"Minsc pretends at nothing, half the way or otherwise!"
Minsc,"Fear not - this blunt blade will be whetted once more, on as many culty butts as he can reach!"
Minsc,"Boo and I, we thank you for your kind words, my friend. But Minsc knows when he has made a mess that is for him, and him alone to clean."
Minsc,Soft and sure as hunting hamsters.
Minsc,"The point is this. I still see the soul behind your eyes. And if you have taught me one thing, it is that all heroes need not look like Minsc."
Minsc,"Ah, but it is a fine thing to walk with friends beneath the warming sun!"
Minsc,"Wherever you walk, so wet the trousers of evil."
Minsc,LOOK AT HIS LITTLE FACE. ARE YOU NOT INSPIRED.
Minsc,Hold still - you are almost as twitchy as Boo!
Minsc,Sewn shut with the finest hamster-hair!
Minsc,"All healed! I will poke the wound, to prove my words are true."
Minsc,"Don't fall in, Boo!"
Minsc,I have no idea what this will do.
Minsc,That would be far too confusing for my hamster.
Minsc,"I think you are thinking too much, my friend - that is why your brain-worm grows fat, while mine own withers from starvation."
Minsc,"You are a barbarian, are you not? The brain will wilt before our rage, and stain itself in its own fluids!"
Minsc,"You are a bard, are you not? Master of charms, and the only wit sharp enough to find rhymes for words such as 'courage', and 'victory', and 'Minsc'!"
Minsc,"You are a cleric, are you not? Ready to call upon the power of a guardian god, to spank this brain for bullying you!"
Minsc,What's in here...?
Minsc,"You are a druid! With the might of hawk, and wolf, and hamster - all of which dine on brain, do they not?"
Minsc,"You are a monk, are you not? Master of the mind - who better to bully the illithids on their own ground?!"
Minsc,"You are a paladin, are you not? So full of yourself that there is more power in your promise than in all the brain's lumpy largeness!"
Minsc,"You are a ranger like Minsc, are you not? We have bested stranger beasts than this brain!"
Minsc,"You are a rogue, are you not? So while Minsc and Boo charge in front to do all of the work, you will creep behind the brain and stick it in its sticky parts!"
Minsc,"You are a sorcerer, are you not? There is more magic in your blood than in all the brain's filthy fluids!"
Minsc,"You are a warlock, are you not? You have a most powerful being at your back - and not counting Boo, there is also your patron!"
Minsc,"But - if Minsc's words are not enough, then listen to those of one far wiser than he."
Minsc,"There, my friend. You ask if Minsc thinks this battle can be won?"
Minsc,"To take on the flayer-form... There must be another way to defeat the brain, surely? If not - better we fight on anyway, and die beautiful!"
Minsc,"You have made some fine friends along your way. Each one a sword for the fight, a heart for your cause, and a boot for evil's underbelly!"
Minsc,Minsc and Boo are honoured to be counted among them.
Minsc,It is a phrase in the old tongue of Rashemen - meaning 'blunt blade'.
Minsc,"The berserker who cannot must into battle with a blunted sword, so that their rage might harm none but themselves."
Minsc,"But still - I will strive to be worthy of this faith you show in me. After all - even a blunt blade can break some bones, is it not so?"
Minsc,"You are a fighter, are you not? Master of combat - and this brain without even a set of fists to defend itself!"
Minsc,"Telthors are the living soul of the land. They flit about, offering petty blessings to those who show respect, or playing tricks on those who do not."
Minsc,"Take heart. When your scars heal, Boo will still find you pretty."
Minsc,He came to me one night with a little book of mischief - full of words and their meanings.
Minsc,"Minsc knows your people well. The skin of the world is thin up in Rashemen, and it is easier there for things to slip between the planes."
Minsc,Boo still will. But quietly.
Minsc,"She too was duped by the Absolute - and she too seeks vengeance. So long as that is so, Minsc will not judge her."
Minsc,"Of the drow I can say only this - she may be treacherous, vicious, and much meaner than she has any need to be. But she is clearly no cleverer than Minsc."
Minsc,Ugh. Please do not speak this way. I just felt Boo roll up into a ball.
Minsc,"Much like baby Minsc loved running head-first into rocks, I'd wager. Dizzying fun - until you are left bawling on your back."
Minsc,"If such a tiny puny druid-man reminds you of Minsc, I think the tadpole may have made a feast of your brain!"
Minsc,Somehow such a person as you describe has entirely escaped Minsc's notice. How strange.
Minsc,"IT WAS NOT A FAIR MATCH, AND HE TURNED INTO AN OWLBEAR MIDWAY THROUGH, AND THERE WAS GREASE ON THE TREE STUMP!"
Minsc,"You will not fall, warlock. And if you do, Minsc shall simply pick you up again. What - do you doubt us in this final hour?"
Minsc,"And you are Wyll of the Pale Eye. Now hush, and turn your mind towards our many, many many enemies."
Minsc,"NO, BOO! THE DRUID DID NOT BEAT MINSC AT THE ARM-WRESTLING!"
Minsc,He is so small that Minsc barely notices his existence.
Minsc,Problem? No problem. 
Minsc,"Pah! Minsc saw the druid chasing himself in circles, and sniffing his own butt last night. He has spent too long as a wolf, and not enough as a man!"
Minsc,That's what I said.
Minsc,His name is Halitosin? How very unfortunate.
Minsc,"Oh, the tiny puny elf with leaves in his hair, and dirt under his fingernails."
Minsc,Who is Halsin?
Minsc,"Even Boo finds him irritating, and Boo is the most patient soul in the Realms!"
Minsc,"An impossible task! Minsc knows everything that Minsc knows, and Boo knows the rest."
Minsc,"Leap now, look later."
Minsc,"Dig your graves, evil! Minsc and Boo come to tuck you in."
Minsc,"You cannot hide, evil! Boo smells your bubbling guts a mile away!"
Minsc,"Less prattle, more battle!"
Minsc,"When all of this is done, Boo will dine on tadpole for a month."
Minsc,"Wizards are either annoying, boring, or evil. The worst ones are all three things at the same time!"
Minsc,GALE! MY GOOD FRIEND! WHERE ARE YOU? MINSC AND BOO WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT THE EXPLODING.
Minsc,Camaraderie! Adventure! Violence!
Minsc,"Minsc knows her people well. The skin of the world is thin up in Rashemen, and it is easier there for things to slip between the planes."
Minsc,"Sometimes these are wonders from other worlds. Sometimes warriors, hungry for plunder. Such visitors have inspired a saying among my people:"
Minsc,"'The Children of Gith live long, and forget the face of death: and so they come to Rashemen to be reminded.'"
Minsc,"They are raiders, so they raid. Minsc's people are berserkers, and so they get a little grumpy at this. It is no bone-deep blood feud, as it is with the Red Wizards of Thay."
Minsc,"Villainous face, meet virtuous fist!"
Minsc,I hope you are not of the ticklish type.
Minsc,See how my skull shines? It is so you might see the fear in your own eyes!
Minsc,"My hamster, he thirsts for justice. DRINK DEEP, BOO!"
Minsc,"Steel, spell, or sweaty embrace - Minsc has you now!"
Minsc,HRRAAAAARGH!
Minsc,"Go for the eyes, Boo - GO FOR THE EYES!"
Minsc,"To arms! No, wait - to SWORDS!"
Minsc,You do not look your most heroic this way. Let Minsc help.
Minsc,Come! There are many more buttocks yet to feel our boot-print.
Minsc,Be well! Boo demands it.
Minsc,"Exactly so - and the illithids are our true enemies. If Boo must choose which enemy to fight - it will be fish eye he dines on first, not that of any githyanki."
Minsc,"And Minsc did not mean to say so, no more than he is a hathran of his high country! "
Minsc,The bravery was mostly Boo's. Minsc simply followed with the shouting and waving of swords.
Minsc,"Tonight, Boo dines on foe-flesh."
Minsc,"Do not drip so much, horn-headed one. Boo does not bite. Well, actually, he does. But only in the service of smiting evil."
Minsc,"If that is not a hero, then Minsc and Boo are no heroes. You're not saying my hamster is not a hero, Wyll...?"
Minsc,The saying matters not. Let it be a thing of doing - you will be blinded by Boo's obvious heroism when you smite evil by his side.
Minsc,"Minsc himself was once almost swayed by a succubus, until Boo set to biting in particular places."
Minsc,"Of Elminster and the sex, I mean."
Minsc,"Goddess or no, it is a fearsome sting to be let down by a lover. And to hear of it from another of her brightbirds!"
Minsc,Minsc does not lie. And heroes do not let their friends die - yes?
Minsc,And you are certain you will be accepted as such? Minsc has not seen a crown fitted for horns before.
Minsc,"Really and truly. Being swayed by evil does not count, so long as you are swift with the smiting afterwards."
Minsc,"Blade of Smiting Evil Frontiers...? Eh. If it is all the same, Minsc and Boo will just call you Wyll."
Minsc,"I broke bread and evil bones with a child of Bhaal. Minsc is not so judgey as you, my friend, so long as Wyll's deed was done for good."
Minsc,"Wyll fights for good, does he not? It is not for Minsc or you to judge a hero like the Blade of Frontiers."
Minsc,"Aha! I see a ring of devils, dangling temptation. And Wyll resisted - what evil is there in this?"
Minsc,Besides - the Children of Gith alone have witnessed a sight that I have long yearned to behold:
Minsc,"No, Minsc has no hatred for githyanki. It is a fine thing to fight against them - and a fine thing to fight beside them too, I think."
Minsc,"Do not drip so much, damp one. Boo does not bite. Well, actually, he does. But only in the service of smiting evil.<br>"
Minsc,You are mesmerised by Boo? Understandable - but time to move!
Minsc,Tonight - Boo dines on foe-flesh.
Minsc,"The finder keeps, yes?"
Minsc,Minsc thinks you will sound better without your teeth.
Minsc,I'd sooner trade blows than words. Meaning violence.
Minsc,"Up, or Boo shall have to go a-biting."
Minsc,"You will not fall today. Well, I suppose you already have."
Minsc,You can sleep when all the slaughtering is done.
Minsc,Do not make my hamster mourn you! He is an ugly crier.
Minsc,Must we? But they haven't seen us yet!
Minsc,WHAT?
Minsc,"Bite your tongue, Boo - so you don't bite theirs."
Minsc,"Eyes, Boo? No? Knees, then!"
Minsc,Boo says you asked for this.
Minsc,This might tickle. But it will certainly hurt.
Minsc,"This is not battle-charge. A waddle, at best."
Minsc,"Oh, boo-hoo, says Boo!"
Minsc,There. I have rubbed some dirt on it. Or perhaps that was dung...
Minsc,"A little too much, perhaps. It is good that Minsc is too reasonable to ever become jealous."
Minsc,"YES! BURN, SAYS YOU AND BURN SAYS BOO! SO MINSC WILL BURN!"
Minsc,WE SHALL SET FIRE TO THE NIGHT ITSELF!
Minsc,"Oh, stop complaining. Boo gets by with less blood than that."
Minsc,"The herbs do nothing, but Boo says you smell better this way."
Minsc,"Was this lump of flesh yours? Too late, stitched inside."
Minsc,Snivelling in the dust? It suits you well.
Minsc,"Stuck. Shall I slap their buttock to get them moving, Boo...?"
Minsc,One boot in front of the other - then up evil's behind!
Minsc,"Never! If he is not careful, Boo will shred his books and use them as bedding!"
Minsc,"Ai, yes. Gale also owns a cat. A cat with wings! That is most unnerving for poor Boo."
Minsc,Gale would do better to educate himself in the ways of sword and steel than to throw these pointy words at Minsc.
Minsc,"It is an inferior word. Far too long to use in a battle cry, which is where a 'butt' belongs."
Minsc,"'Posterior', he says. 'Can you say 'posterior'?' I refused! Minsc does not need to know the language of wizards."
Minsc,I would sooner sniff Boo's butt.
Minsc,"Your overripe melon-head, begging to be squashed. Your black and beady little eyes. Your - ! Yes, Boo, sorry."
Minsc,"Ah. Those are the strains of our little boat-ride, says Boo. But no matter - it is the smell of victory all the same!"
Minsc,That is a thousand times more interesting than anything that has ever been written in a book.
Minsc,"Safe in Boo's sticky little fingers. Wait - are those fingers, or toes?"
Minsc,"This will look well in your nest, Boo."
Minsc,"You say the path between good and evil is not always clear. Very well, says Minsc - Boo has always guided my boots, and so now he shall guide yours, too. "
Minsc,"I see. In the case of Nine-Fingers, perhaps it was all bunched up in that finger she lost. It shall be for Minsc and Boo to be her virtuous pinky."
Minsc,"There is good and evil in all! Let us go crack villainous skulls, so that the virtue might leak free!"
Minsc,Of course. Of course! One look into his beady little eyes should be enough to tell Minsc there is pure and untainted goodness in this world.
Minsc,"Thank you, my friend. As ever, I shall do only what my heart and hamster tell me to:"
Minsc,I feel better. Minsc is ready to go and do some butt-kicking.
Minsc,"Eh... do you know, I think the feeling has passed. I am well. And it was just gas. And I have forgotten the question."
Minsc,"Yes, Boo, we really SHOULD be on our way!"
Minsc,"Ah - and by this you mean, so it is for all living creatures? A deep wisdom indeed."
Minsc,My hamster has the dibs.
Minsc,"No, my friend. If good and evil are a thing of the choosing, then it is for Boo alone to judge the virtues of his breakfast bath."
Minsc,My hamster wishes to parley.
Minsc,I am just holding it for my hamster.
Minsc,Not now - I need a moment.
Minsc,A soft and squeaky word.
Minsc,*Inhale* PSSSSST!
Minsc,"Cat got your tongue? If not, Boo will take it."
Minsc,"Quite the deed done, eh, my friend?"
Minsc,Boo bids you farewell.
Minsc,"Fine lodgings you have found, my friend! Boo is already in negotiations with the guardian spirits of this place."
Minsc,"In Baldur's Gate, they are likely to be rat-formed, and eager to charge rent. But Boo shall secure safe slumber for all!"
Minsc,Now - what do you need of Minsc?
Minsc,"Onward, then. If you are so set on taking the form of a fish, then Minsc and Boo will keep you from the Netherbrain's hook."
Minsc,"The illithid lied about his nether-pebbles. Only say the word, and Minsc will feed them to him."
Minsc,"If Karlach's mind is set, then Boo and I have faith. So bright a soul-fire cannot be quenched by any slippery fish-form."
Minsc,"Let us away, friend. Minsc and Boo are at your back. Your... slick and slippery back."
Minsc,Back to the city - Boo thinks it is time for a second bite of this brain.
Minsc,"The brain is near - can you smell it? Salt, and sweat, and - !"
Minsc,"Ah, I spoke too soon of starting the day. I have told him he is pretty enough, but Boo insists on returning to the beauty sleep."
Minsc,Bah. Let me find a chance to demonstrate instead. It need not be a goblin - an unmannerly halfling will do. The point is this:
Minsc,"Quietly, Boo."
Minsc,Why do you invite archers to give you a feathered tail?
Minsc,"No trap, Boo. Probably no trap."
Minsc,"Peek-a-Boo, Boo."
Minsc,"Greetings, friend."
Minsc,"Boo, he has written you a poem. But I do not understand it."
Minsc,"Squeak, friend!"
Minsc,"After all - in every city there is a sweaty underbelly, crying out for a virtuous scrubbing. None better to wield the brush than Minsc and Boo!"
Minsc,"Aha! Perhaps this is the reason, Boo. It is not because of the legendary thickness of my skull."
Minsc,"The mind of Minsc was occupied with important matters. I was browsing at a slum vendor's stall, looking for Boo's favourite nuts."
Minsc,And then I was stone!
Minsc,"If you wish to know the answer to that, ask a statue."
Minsc,"I do not like these metal men on the streets, or the villains who hide behind them. But the new world is not so different to the old one."
Minsc,"The city still clings to the hill, the sea still stretches on forever. And the stench of evil still makes Boo wish for a tiny peg on his nose."
Minsc,"As long as that stench remains, no matter how old or young the world is, Minsc and Boo will not rest."
Minsc,"Jaheira says Minsc and Boo were often draped in flowers, and showered with wine. Still as stone, but the life of the party nonetheless!"
Minsc,"But there is no glory without action, and no valour without violence!"
Minsc,"I would rather be as small as Boo, yet made of muscle and rage and virtue, than as large as Minsc but made of cold stone."
Minsc,"Minsc has lost many things - his witch, his mind, his home, his friends, his mind - but many good things remain."
Minsc,"Boo is here. My steel is here. Jaheira's face has more lines, but her tongue and wits are as sharp as ever."
Minsc,"You are of the same blood as our old friend: a Bhaalspawn, and as close to Minsc as if they were his own kin. "
Minsc,That makes Minsc your uncle.
Minsc,"So long as you do not call Bhaal 'Father Dearest', you may call Minsc whatever you wish. Family is a complicated knot, big as a fist!"
Minsc,"Better not to ask. He has many dozen cousins, and not all are so open-minded about we who walk on our hind legs as he."
Minsc,"There is a lesson in this. We are born into a bloodline, yes - but we need not be bound by it."
Minsc,Countless tales are told of Boo and Minsc. Many of them are so outlandish that even I do not know if they are true!
Minsc,Did Minsc bravely fend off the seductive wiles of a succubus in the cloisters of Candlekeep? Maybe. 
Minsc,Did he take a bath in the River Styx and temporarily forget himself? I do not remember.
Minsc,"Did he travel with a spawn of the god of murder, who warred against his evil brethren, and battled triumphantly at the Throne of Bhaal itself?"
Minsc,Of course. It was a splendid adventure.
Minsc,A curious question. Are a child and his father always alike?
Minsc,A little shake just to see what's inside...
Minsc,"Still as a statue. Trust Minsc, it is not so fun as it looks."
Minsc,You see? This is why a warrior should go nowhere without a hamster in his pants.
Minsc,"Ai, Boo - you have covered yourself in pocket-fluff."
Minsc,"Then let us rely on swords, not words, my friend."
Minsc,And Boo shall watch Shadowheart like a tiny wingless hawk.
Minsc,There is no bond that can withstand Boo's nibbling.
Minsc,"Wriggle, my friend! WRIGGLE!"
Minsc,"I would carry you, but Boo is a little jealous."
Minsc,"Would you like a firm pat on the back, also?"
Minsc,Minsc believes in you! Boo told him to.
Minsc,Boo hopes you are not of the ticklish type.
Minsc,Hold still. You are almost as twitchy as Boo!
Minsc,"I know little of herb-lore, but this one smells nice."
Minsc,"No, Boo, you may lick the blood later."
Minsc,"Hoho, such a wound! Boo could play peek-a-boo inside."
Minsc,My friend! You are so fearsome that your very blood flees your body!
Minsc,"Haha! Minsc, too, likes to block enemy blows with his face!"
Minsc,"Take Minsc! He does not have a clear memory of the face of his father, but he does remember tugging on the thick, red whiskers that sprang from his chin."
Minsc,Minsc believes in you! And not just because his hamster told him to.
Minsc,Boo prefers a scratch behind the ears - but this shall do for you.
Minsc,Boo has always stood by Minsc - even when Minsc made mistakes.
Minsc,But would Boo have stood by the Stone Lord? I do not think so.
Minsc,Be sure that your friend has not changed so much that she is no longer the person you knew.
Minsc,"And in the meantime, Boo shall watch her like a tiny wingless hawk."
Minsc,Then I do not understand why she shares your camp.
Minsc,"Boo says he believes that you are on the side of justice, but that the stink of Shar is not one easily washed out."
Minsc,"We shall not know which side has won until it hits the earth, I think. So cough it up, Boo!"
Minsc,Not minding is one of the many things Minsc is known for!
Minsc,"So the plot for the Astral Prism was just another game between the gods. Some day, Boo may have to go up there and give them a talking to."
Minsc,Minsc is no thief! It was all Boo's idea.
Minsc,"I hope you did not poop in the pocket this time, Boo."
Minsc,No hard feelings. Boo picks my pockets whenever I buy nuts.
Minsc,Hm. Perhaps it would have been more honest to shake them by the ankles.
Minsc,A little pat on the head for my friend.
Minsc,I still do not understand 'pragmatic'. But I believe you are a friend to Minsc and Boo. And an enemy to evil.
Minsc,A beard for the ages! Boo could have nested there happily through even the harshest of Rashemen winters.
Minsc,Correct! There are more whiskers on Boo's tiny face than on the mighty chin of Minsc!
Minsc,"Run! Walk! Flail about some, at least!"
Minsc,"Fear not! If you cannot move, then Minsc shall toss you at the enemy!"
Minsc,"Boo, he basks in your brilliance!"
Minsc,"LOOK IN MY HAMSTER'S EYES, AND KNOW YOU ARE A HERO!"
Minsc,Follow Minsc's lead! Do whatever the hells this is!
Minsc,May your boots always find home in a butt!
Minsc,May your boots always find home in a butt.
Minsc,"Well, Boo? How do you want to do this?"
Minsc,"Know that if you poke Boo, no higher dimension will keep you safe!"
Minsc,"ARGH! My EYE, Boo! They went for my EYE!"
Minsc,Boo has not given you leave to die.
Minsc,"My friend, have you considered dodging?"
Minsc,Are you well? Shall I shake you by the shoulders some?
Minsc,"Wherever you walk, so wet the trousers of evil!"
Minsc,Boo has no time for a rousing speech. Try this instead!
Minsc,Baubles for Boo? 
Minsc,Let us see...
Minsc,"It is not stealing, Boo! Not... yet."
Minsc,"You see, Boo! You quiver in vain."
Minsc,"I was speaking to Boo. Reminding him of all the times that things seemed darkest, and how we still found the light in the end."
Minsc,"Do not be sad, Boo. Karlach vanquished a villain today. As for the rest of it... well."
Minsc,"Sneak a peek, Boo!"
Minsc,Why not? We can fight to the death another time.
Minsc,"No teeth. No tongue. Just trinkets, please."
Minsc,"I am the night. A pity, then, that it is so bright out."
Minsc,Hush! I am surprising Boo for his birthday! He is... uh... eh... how old do hamsters get...?
Minsc,"Boo...? Are you dancing down there, or...?"
Minsc,A little to the left? But not so hard you make me giggle.
Minsc,Boo will lend a little of his brilliance.
Minsc,"Be free, says Boo!"
Minsc,"If Boo must gnaw off the limb, so be it!"
Minsc,"Psst. Move, or Boo will poke you a second time."
Minsc,Hold still so that Boo might nibble at your bonds.
Minsc,"Well, yes, but also - "
Minsc,Boo is correct. No beard! There are more whiskers on his tiny face than on the mighty chin of Minsc!
Minsc,"If Minsc did not inherit the flaming red hair of his mother, or the bushy red beard of his father, why would the spawn of Bhaal inherit his wickedness?"
Minsc,And failing that - to end his madness with the cleansing blade.
Minsc,Minsc is not here to judge - that is a thing for hamsters and hathrans alone.
Minsc,I have many more thoughts about beards to share. I did not know you cared to hear them!
Minsc,"It is simple. As with all battles, the winner will be the one that carries the bigger sword."
Minsc,It is precisely the same! Although one is far easier to kick than the other.
Minsc,Your gaze is naturally caught on my handsome face - the face that is loved by all - but cast your eyes down. Just a little. Not so far as to make Minsc blush.
Minsc,Do you see it?
Minsc,"Yes, Boo, of course we will say hello."
Minsc,Boo likes the look of you.
Minsc,"A friendly word. That word is 'hello, friend!'"
Minsc,The finder keeps!
Minsc,"Now - look closely at Minsc, and what do you see?"
Minsc,Boo has called the dibs!
Minsc,"Do not speak ill of our friends, and please, focus your gaze on Minsc."
Minsc,"The bards sing of fallen gods and mighty battles, but that is a small part of any saga."
Minsc,They do not sing of the times in between.
Minsc,LOOOOOT!
Minsc,"Do the honours, Boo."
Minsc,"No, I do not know if you can eat it, Boo."
Minsc,"Do something, says Boo."
Minsc,A gift for Boo?
Minsc,Let us have a little look.
Minsc,Boo has called the dibs.
Minsc,There is no shame in tears. Only in everything else about you.
Minsc,"Die, or do not. Just cease this squawking."
Minsc,I will heal you. But only because my hamster says I should.
Minsc,Shall I put you in my pocket?
Minsc,Where?
Minsc,The hunter stalks his prey. The hamster waits for the fun to start.
Minsc,"The enemy of my enemy is my sword and my boot. But the enemy of my enemy may also be my enemy, for evil often eats itself for supper."
Minsc,Minsc says you may not be as righteous as you believe yourself to be.
Minsc,Do not be ridiculous.
Minsc,"If any of us is chosen by the gods, it is obviously Boo."
Minsc,"Real...? Boo, I think our friend has suffered a head-wound of his own."
Minsc,"Real...? Boo, I think our friend has suffered a head-wound of her own."
Minsc,"Real...? Boo, I think our friend has suffered a head-wound of their own."
Minsc,Done!
Minsc,"Now, shall we away? My boots crave the crunch of unvirtuous nethers."
Minsc,"Ahh! You speak of Minsc's misshapen skull? It is true, I once suffered a most heroic head-wound."
Minsc,"Ahh, you come in search of stories? It is not yet time to tuck Boo in for the night - but very well!"
Minsc,"After our adventurings with the Bhaalspawn, Boo had had his fill of godly flesh. So we returned to Baldur's Gate for a time."
Minsc,Wait - you can see me? 
Minsc," If I decide you are evil, my blade will inform you of the fact. "
Minsc, Enough trick questions! Evil is clearly evil. 
Minsc,See how still Boo lies? He dreams of evil's doom!
Minsc,WHAT? Wait. Shh.
Minsc, Evil! Never! 
Minsc, Dark. Lonely. Helpless. 
Minsc,"Sneaking, sneaking, sneaking."
Minsc,CRAMP!
Minsc,Head-high to a halfling.
Minsc,Better to look evil in the eye. Even if it be very small.
Minsc,"My hamster hears, and I obey."
Minsc,"I'd sooner split a skull, but as you wish."
Minsc,A sound strategy! I'm sure.
Minsc,Let me inspire you! Are you inspired?!
Minsc,"Do as Minsc does, and simply ignore it!"
Minsc,Back into the battle!
Minsc,Boo will not abandon you.
Minsc,Or perhaps the night is too large to burn. I do not know. But I do know that I am angry.
Minsc,"As for the headache, well - justice cannot always afford to be gentle."
Minsc,It was as I recovered that Boo first appeared. He told me that I had felt the great poking finger of justice - marking Minsc as its champion and Boo as my guide!
Minsc,"The problem with one so gazing of their navel, however - they are easily ambushed. Brigands split my skull like a sodden wine-skin."
Minsc,"Before Boo, I was a typical berserker of Rashemen. Duty-bound, and full of my own seriousness."
Minsc,There will be time to play statues later!
Minsc,Minsc waits. Boo watches.
Minsc,Still as stone? I have had the practice.
Minsc,"This is so in Rashemen - but not beyond her borders. Here, the spirits sleep - and perhaps we ought to be glad of this."
Minsc,We have! Is it not wonderful?
Minsc,"To irk your friend so that she wishes to fill you with some crossbow quarrels - but knowing she never will, for fear of hitting your hamster."
Minsc,"There is no need for sweet words between companions such as we. Too often those are the weapons of flatterers, and frauds."
Minsc,"You suggest that Minsc uses the term lightly? Simply leaps from Dynaheir to Jaheira, with no caring for the custom itself? An unworthy thought - and WRONG!"
Minsc,"She needed a protector, and Boo suggested that it might as well be Minsc. And when she went her own way, Minsc and Boo set to thinking: "
Minsc,There is power in the wychlaran bond. Far too much to be wasted on weeping. To use that power to serve the living does not sully the dead - it honours them.
Minsc,You do not know this custom? Great Rashemen is ruled by the Masked Ones - wise women you might call 'witches'.
Minsc,"So it was with Minsc and his witch, Dynaheir. Until she died, and Minsc had to carry on without her."
Minsc,"Hm. So... duty, camaraderie, help in troubled times - what I call the bond of a wychlaran, you simply call... friendship?"
Minsc,And Wyll is my wychlaran!
Minsc,Back into battle!
Minsc,And Lae'zel is my wychlaran!
Minsc,And Gale is my wychlaran!
Minsc,And Shadowheart is my wychlaran!
Minsc,And Halsin is my wychlaran!
Minsc,"My thanks to you, wychlaran. You have given me much to think on - and should some enemy blow knock it loose again, Boo shall remind me."
Minsc,"And Minthara is - eh. A friend of yours, I am sure."
Minsc,A hero is only as good the friends they have at their back.
Minsc,This is why Boo favours the spot just above my buttocks.
Minsc,"'Mind your own godsdamned business.' My hamster's words, not mine!"
Minsc,"Of course! Minsc always listens to Jaheira, even if Boo must sometimes explain her meaning afterwards. "
Minsc,"Well, Boo? Explain yourself."
Minsc,Clear enough?
Minsc,"Boo has a way with words that we lack. All that space in the cheeks, I am thinking."
Minsc,Can you not? Do you not see his noble bearing? The deep wells of wisdom that are his eyes? 
Minsc,There is nothing jestful in the bond between a ranger and his companion.
Minsc,And Astarion is my wychlaran!
Minsc,If we must.
Minsc,Come! There are many more buttocks yet to feel our boot-print!
Minsc,Have you met my hamster?
Minsc,He fears you will sacrifice him in some Sharran ritual of dark oils and leather.
Minsc,"Boo will not permit himself to be held by you any longer, Shadowheart."
Minsc,And full of nuts!
Minsc,"It pleases you, to hold him? And you have truly cleansed yourself of Shar?"
Minsc,"Shadowheart. I saw you pluck Boo from the ground, when you thought no one was watching. "
Minsc,You are the most beautiful thing he has ever seen.
Minsc,"Bah! Fine, Boo. Lae'zel - my hamster wishes me to tell you:"
Minsc,"There was a time when you would flirt with goodness and justice, Viconia - let Minsc and Boo be the last to reject your advances."
Minsc,"Ah - in that case, home is in my pocket, nestled on soft bed of flesh and fluff."
Minsc,A dead and foul place. Only a villain would nest down in these tunnels.
Minsc,"Karlach! Minsc and Boo thought better of you, than to be so concerned with looks."
Minsc,He is quite obviously in his prime. For a miniature giant space hamster.
Minsc,"Karlach - do I see you gazing long at Boo? You wish to have a hamster of your own, I think."
Minsc,What is an elder brain?
Minsc,"Hm. Boo and I, we are in need of honest berserkers to keep the Guild honest in turn. Will you show us how this 'working' is done?"
Minsc,"Are you familiar with the evil works of Nine-Fingers and her Guild, Karlach?"
Minsc,"And there is always Boo, with the needful nip when anger is slow in coming. This is not how you do it...?"
Minsc,But Minsc could master none of this. Which made him sad. Which made him mad. Which made him the berserker you see before you.
Minsc,Oh. There is much to be learned. Deep breaths. Meditative trances. Strange and stinking mushrooms. 
Minsc,Better yet! What swifter way to strike at evil's butt than to crawl through its innards?
Minsc,"AH! The smell of adventure, in the very heart of the city!"
Minsc,"Does Jaheira not set your heart at ease, Boo? It is comforting, to know that one so wise can be so wrong."
Minsc,"If Minsc had any hairs on his head, this place would set them all a-standing. And look how Boo's bunches his hackles!"
Minsc,"Oh, praise the Three! Minsc was afraid he had shamed myself. I will, eh, leave a penny at the bar."
Minsc,"Jaheira, Minsc's memory of his last time in this taproom is a little... fuzzy. Did he...?"
Minsc,"All of these statues - could they, too, be heroes all? Frozen in stone until the city has need of them?"
Minsc,You are asking Minsc to be pragmatic. That is a word that Jaheira uses to win arguments.
Minsc,It does not work on Minsc because Minsc does not know what the word means.
Minsc,If you are telling Minsc that it would be right to plant his boot on the hindquarters of a thousand tiny orphans in order to save the city...
Minsc,"Who adorned these walls? Better to have hung a mirror, and taken a good long look at themselves."
Minsc,"Quickly now, before you grow roots!"
Minsc,Heh - pay Minsc no mind!
Minsc,Boo is just deciding which of your corpses would be best to loot.
Minsc,Sword at my side and hamster at hand.
Minsc,"Justice, truth, and the virtuous boot."
Minsc,"Steel sharp, hamster hungry."
Minsc,"Life is simple, and so is Minsc."
Minsc,The city reeks of evil! Or perhaps Boo just needs to bathe.
Minsc,"Another day, another dajemma."
Minsc,Boo says the tadpole thrives on our misery - to think dark thoughts is only to feed the darkness.
Minsc,"Yes, Boo. I know you miss her too."
Minsc,"That is what I remember, more than any battles against Bhaal and his spawn."
Minsc,"In the meantime, perhaps we can find a way to bring Lord Gortash back. It would be good to kill him a second time - for Boo, I mean."
Minsc,"In the meantime, perhaps we can find a way to bring Lord Gortash back. Perhaps it would lift Karlach's spirits to kill him a second time."
Minsc,This is why you have Minsc. He knows that the knowing matters not - only the doing!
Minsc,"Wyll Ravengard! Eh - Boo usually advises Minsc in matters of politeness, but he is uncertain whether we ought to bow, or simply squeak an oath of allegiance...?"
Minsc,"I would gladly be a babysitter again, to see her smile."
Minsc,"Evil hides, and Boo seeks!"
Minsc,"Not long after, Minsc and Boo were captured, and Dynaheir was dead."
Minsc,Minsc frowned and complained. He felt more like a babysitter than a berserker.
Minsc,"Sorcerous Sundries. Dynaheir fell in love. Dragged poor Minsc there every day, and made him stand watch while she browsed the shelves."
Minsc,"Then, one day, we walked past a shop full of wonders. Tiny magics fizzed in the air, and wizards from every corner of the world bickered and bartered."
Minsc,"She complained of the smell, although she complained of Boo's smell too and he smells of fresh honeycakes, so Minsc believes her nose was confused."
Minsc,"She hated the city at first. Too busy, she said, too noisy. Too many people. "
Minsc,"Gorion's Ward, Imoen, Jaheira, Minsc, Boo... and Dynaheir. My witch."
Minsc,"Eh... the first step is difficult, of course. Minsc could throw you in, if you prefer?"
Minsc,"When Sarevok's butt had been kicked so hard that we thought he would never return, we settled in Baldur's Gate for a while."
Minsc,Justice walks on four feet. And sleeps in my boot.
Minsc,My boot craves the crunch of unvirtuous nethers.
Minsc,"Sleep with one eye open, evil. Maybe both."
Minsc,"Every kicked buttock, another step on the path."
Minsc,Boo thinks you have had every chance to change your ways. Count yourself blessed it is not he who judges you today.
Minsc,Pay Minsc no mind!
Minsc,But how Dynaheir smiled.
Minsc,"If you say Minsc must swing the goblin a little longer, then that is what he shall do. "
Minsc,Justice is not so gentle.
Minsc,No butt is safe from Boo!
Minsc,This encounter has left me a little confused.
Minsc,"Forgive my hamster. His cunning mind was made for the depths of space, not the depths of the ocean."
Minsc,Boo... I have been having the strangest dream... Boo...?
Minsc,RAAAAAAH!
Minsc,"I am Minsc of Rashemen, Boot of the Absolute!"
Minsc,"Array your end-parts before me, evil. The Absolute has given me boots enough for all!"
Minsc,"Lord Boo is most pleased to make your acquaintance, my lady! Word of your grace has spread far and wide among the hamster houses."
Minsc,"Some battles, even Boo is not brave enough to fight."
Minsc,Really?
Minsc,One of the perils of travelling with Jaheira.
Minsc,"Jaheira, our friend has put their trust in us. Boo thinks it only right to return the gesture, no?<br>"
Minsc,"Pin your eyes to the treacherous she-drow. Do not focus on the many, many others - Boo will handle them.<br>"
Minsc,"Eh, Boo? Can this Netherbrain sprout Nether-lice?"
Minsc,There - let us try the stones on the tyrant's tiara!<br>
Minsc,"You do not look well, wizard. Beyond even your daily feebleness."
Minsc,"Alone, wizard? I thought you were of the clever kind. Boo and I are here, and here we -"
Minsc,There is something strangely familiar about this place. Almost as if Minsc and Boo have walked these halls before...
Minsc,"Well yes, Boo, the horseless chariots of Avernus are impressive too - but that would be no kind of name, would it?"
Minsc,"A noble chant, is it not? Hail Wyll, Blade of Avernus! "
Minsc,"What we did might feel an evil thing, I know."
Minsc,But I will take the head of the largest Watcher we can find. Boo may have need of a chamber pot.
Minsc,"A noble chant, is it not? Hail Wyll, Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate!"
Minsc,"Step soft, my friend. Such places are full of traps, and Minsc is too often finding them with foot and face."
Minsc,"You and Jaheira whisper much together, eh? You have grown close. Minsc is glad to see it - every hero needs hamster and hathran both."
Minsc,"A sad thing, to raise a child down in the darkness. Small wonder Shadowheart is so pale. And smelling of damp."
Minsc,"I am truly sorry, Shadowheart."
Minsc,No! NO more listening to brains!
Minsc,Tell it to split its own seams - end this!
Minsc,NO! We will NOT let this come to pass!
Minsc,Why?
Minsc,The city taverns offer ale much like the squeezings of an ogre's small-pants. That does not mean Minsc must drink it.
Minsc,"Two or three tankards at most, for avoiding of offence. I will bring you to such a place, to wash the tyrant from your tongue."
Minsc,Minsc hears. He does not heed. Boo keeps only the company of heroes - and so none among our company could be anything else.
Minsc,"Minsc finds that the less thinking he does, the easier the trusting comes."
Minsc,"But none like this! Whatever happens, show no fear, and stay your hand. Trust in Minsc!"
Minsc,"My friend. From our brief sharing of skulls, I know you have faced many strange beings."
Minsc,You hurt Jaheira's family - you might as well strike at Minsc and Boo themselves!
Minsc,...Goodbye.
Minsc,Jaheira has left your side - and so Boo and I must go to hers. I only lingered long enough to say goodbye.
Minsc,I did not want it to be true. But Boo sees the evil in your eyes - he knows what you have done to Jaheira.
Minsc,"Jaheira, too, will wish to leave your side when I tell her of your foulness."
Minsc,"Set yourself to rights - should our paths cross again, my hamster will not show such restraint!"
Minsc,Boo has phrased it much more harshly - but just as true! We will walk with you no longer!
Minsc,"Minsc and Boo have watched you for some time, and one thing has become clear:"
Minsc,HRAAAAARGH!
Minsc,"But that anger sours into something gloomier, I think. Go comfort her, Boo - I can ask Aylin to demonstrate her skills another time."
Minsc,Hoho! That move - the wizard's twiddly little spell-fingers availed him little against Dame Aylin's anger.
Minsc,"I might have called it an evil thing, once, to raise your hand to those who love you.<br>"
Minsc,We will not speak of this again.
Minsc,Night-time raids are the height of rudeness in Rashemen. Could they not have attacked by morning?
Minsc,Come! We've cracked through the Brain's city-shell. Boo would like a nibble at its soft and squishy centre.
Minsc,"It sounds like strange advice, but it has served me well in the past."
Minsc,"You did well to spurn the devil's contract, my friend. Minsc's teachers always said he was better at bleeding than reading."
Minsc,"Jaheira, littering the streets in broad daylight? I swear - sometimes, it is as if she does not care for this city at all.<br>"
Minsc,"The Stone Lord had his chance. So shall the Bhaalspawn, says Boo."
Minsc,"Now I wonder if it was not done to hide them from Mystra, and the snares she sets for young and prideful boys, hm?"
Minsc,"It is an old custom, not well-observed. In truth I thought it born of caution, after some catastrophe wrought by wizardly men-folk of old."
Minsc,Minsc has crossed blades in the Blood War. Blown bubbles in the River Styx. He is no stranger to the Hells.
Minsc,Hmm. Boo remembers the scent of this place well. Watch for the wrinkling of his nose - and know that evil is near.
Minsc,"Bah. Pick your moment, then - and when you do, Minsc will pick wicked teeth from betwixt his fingers."
Minsc,"You wish to show Minsc the ways of patience? Jaheira once tried, before it set her hair to greying."
Minsc,A soulless monster.
Minsc,"But, if you must be certain, he will wriggle into a different bedroll each night. The first to complain, well - there you have it."
Minsc,"NO, BOO, YOU WILL NOT TELL HER! MINSC SAID NOTHING!"
Minsc,"Perhaps we will see him again, when we walk into his master's trap."
Minsc,"Astarion's brother is known to me, I think. He once bought me drinks at that very bar, and was most eager to hold Boo."
Minsc,Everyone else saw the large and leathern githyanki woman. Yes...?
Minsc,You will not suffer beneath the devil's yoke for long. Mizora thinks herself protected by her paper - but Boo needs new scraps for his bedding.
Minsc,"The Gur are honoured in Rashemen. They may have been blinded by grief, but still... they deserved better.<br>"
Minsc,It can only be a good thing when gith war against gith. Minsc and Boo are simply grateful to be included.
Minsc,"This Mizora is quite pleased with herself, for one who stinks of the Hells."
Minsc,Hah! The heart of a berserker beats in the cleric's chest! Shar thinks this pain is a punishment? No!
Minsc,"Night-time raids are considered the height of rudeness in Rashemen. We shall find them, and retrieve Astarion. "
Minsc,Do not mourn Astarion. The Gur are known to be a just and righteous people among the Rashemaar.
Minsc,"Astarion still has the look of a pale and puny child to me. And he had best mind his appetite, lest Boo take to some night-time nibbling of his own."
Minsc,"You still have the look of a pale and puny child to me, Astarion. And you had best mind your appetite, lest Boo take to some night-time nibbling of his own."
Minsc,"A few nonsense words, some slain beasts, and one becomes some all-powerful being? No - I do not believe it."
Minsc,"A clever ruse, my friend - the wizard will not think to flee. And when Aylin descends on him, he will have time to conjure naught but a puddle in his pantaloons."
Minsc,"Astarion may borrow Minsc's muscles whenever he is needful. Brave, powerful, puny Astarion!"
Minsc,But Lae'zel is still here. Will you not join them? 
Minsc,"See how the dragons flee you, Boo? Now they know you stand as this plane's protector."
Minsc,Wyll shall not suffer beneath the devil's yoke for long. Mizora thinks herself protected by her paper - but Boo needs new scraps for his bedding.
Minsc,Lae'zel - what are you doing!?
Minsc,Wherever you lead. But remember:
Minsc,"Guide us well, lest Boo take the reins and whip our butts back to the path of virtue."
Minsc,Of course not. Boo is.
Minsc,"Minsc bent the knee, as you asked. But all four of Boo's little legs remain upright, and primed for Sarevok's tender parts."
Minsc,"Of course I trust you, my friend. But remember:"
Minsc,"My hamster mislikes this, but I have assured him - you have some purpose to this play-acting. "
Minsc,"Minsc does not have the words. But Boo has warmth, if Wyll will let him share it a while."
Minsc,"I am sorry, Wyll. I do not have the words. But Boo has warmth, if you will let him share it a while."
Minsc,Boo did not doubt us for a moment. Not during any of our many failures.
Minsc,To lose someone you love... Minsc and Boo know this feeling well.
Minsc,"May I borrow this hammer, and beat whoever named it about the brains?"
Minsc,"Oh, damn it! To end a devil in the hells is to end him for true. Boo was hoping to make a hobby of killing Raphael over and over again."
Minsc,"Yes, Orin has taken little Yenna. But she is relying on us to save her - and so that is what we are going to do."
Minsc,My blade will be the decider of sides!
Minsc,"You may borrow Minsc's muscles whenever it is needful. Brave, powerful, puny Astarion!"
Minsc,WAIT!
Minsc,"An infernal contract. Sounds nice and cosy, does it not?"
Minsc,It was unwise of you to sign yourself over to Raphael. Everyone knows that a devil binds you by your name.
Minsc,It is exactly this off-ness I seek to address. A berserker must enter battle with an empty mind.
Minsc,It is exactly Karlach's concerns which concern Minsc. A berserker must enter battle with an empty mind.
Minsc,"When dark thoughts invade, it is a friend's duty to dislodge them. Be it by exercise, or repeated blows to the skull."
Minsc,It will be a good chance for our friend to empty her mind of the news she just heard.
Minsc,Do not hold back during our sparring. A berserker must enter battle with an empty mind.
Minsc,"Pin your eyes to the treacherous she-drow. Do not focus on the many, many others - Boo will handle them."
Minsc,"Should I be so honoured, I will wear the boot-print of Karlach Demonsbane with pride."
Minsc,Boo says he will take that wager!
Minsc,Karlach can press flesh to flesh again! Do you know what this means?
Minsc,Hah! Do not be alarmed to find him toasting on your engine some cold camp night. But that is not my meaning.
Minsc,You can press flesh to flesh again! Do you know what this means?
Minsc,"My friend, I could lift this smith and rain little kisses upon his brow! "
Minsc,But... never before to make him feel so sad. There is no justice in this. None at all.
Minsc,You would be parted from Boo so soon? Before he has even given his victory speech?<br>
Minsc,"This place could use a little sunshine. Keep a close eye for curtains, Boo!"
Minsc,"That city is a sizzling boil of corruption, with fiends 'round every corner. Boo cannot wait!"
Minsc,"There are fallen to honour, as well. So many that we may never learn all of their names - but that is no reason not to try."
Minsc,Astarion...? Boo says you are beginning to smell like a festival-day feast...
Minsc,"We will find you, Astarion! AND BOO WILL BRING A SUNFLOWER!"
Minsc,"Heroically spoken! We must find an inn. Minsc has been banned from his share of ale-halls, but I am sure you and Boo can speak for me."
Minsc,I am not sure it is a call that Boo can answer.
Minsc,"It is an injustice, that those you saved will not see the goodness behind an evil face. But Boo and I - we will visit!"
Minsc,Boo thinks you are very wise. He only wishes to remind you that his brain - while vast - would not make much of a meal. 
Minsc,"We will drink for Gale. Boo and I are banned from most of the inns in the city, but you may order for us. "
Minsc,"But... never before to make him feel so sad. Minsc and Boo... they can only pity you, cleric. For now."
Minsc,"No, Boo, I still do not understand what it means."
Minsc,"A noble chant, is it not? Hail Wyll, Blade of Frontiers!"
Minsc,Boo likes him.
Minsc,"No, you're right Boo. That is a stupid, stupid name."
Minsc,"Shadowheart? No. Sharess! No, that was the name of the tavern. Tavern? Tav!"
Minsc,"Minsc has flattened parts of the city before. The masons, they seem to prefer he stand and watch."
Minsc,"Yes, Orin has taken the loathsome drow. But she is our comrade - and so we are going to save her."
Minsc,"You gaze into Minsc's soul and see his foul crimes! You smell the stench of evil upon him, pointy claws primed, ready to scratch out his eyes!"
Minsc,No? You are certain?
Minsc,"Your leader is not wrong. The Guild is a band of treacherous scoundrels, and Nine-Fingers the worst among them!"
Minsc,"MY HAMSTER WILL COUNT TO THREE! LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS, ZHENTARIM, AND BOO WILL SPARE YOUR LIVES!"
Minsc,Enough of your filth. Cover your ears Boo. The cracking of the necks of evil will be louder than the mating cries of a snow tiger.<br>
Minsc,"Even now, your tongue twists the truth. When you were young and ten-fingered still, Minsc and Boo were stone - enstatuated on a city square!"
Minsc,"Like a berserker lodge of my homeland. No army or militia, serving the local lords - but heroes, working for the common good!"
Minsc,Very well - Minsc and Boo accept!
Minsc,"Boo and I will be your berserker lodge, taking the ugly ways of your Guild and beating them into a more virtuous shape!"
Minsc,Boo?
Minsc,"What say you, Boo? When the Absolute is slain, shall we join Nine-Fingers Keene and show her the ways of goodness?"
Minsc,Calm can not fight evil! Only Minsc can fight evil.
Minsc,"My friend, I am touched by your kind words. And now I must be equal to them!"
Minsc,"You have planted a burr in my brain, guildmaster. Once I have dislodged the worm and redeemed myself in my hamster's eyes... we will return to this matter."
Minsc,No. Minsc has not always done what is right - but evil is evil. It is a choice - and Nine-Fingers made hers a long time ago.
Minsc,"That story you told... if it be true, then... I am sorry I could not save you then."
Minsc,"But when Minsc thinks of those villains tormenting our gentle moon-witch, he wants to kick them in the cloisters!"
Minsc,I do not like this bendy battle-stance.
Minsc,It is difficult to charge from down here.
Minsc,"Stand, quickly, lest your failure stain Minsc's hands."
Minsc,"What, am I to carry you on my back?"
Minsc,"Yes. I may not be able to trust my mind, but I trust my friend. Evil is evil - it is a choice and you made yours a long time ago."
Minsc,"Minsc does not sneak, queen cutpurse. He follows a direct line from boot to butt."
Minsc,"Minsc has no such style. We are here to cleanse the Zhentish taint, not to rub it all the deeper."
Minsc,"Hm. Boo intended to taste Zhentish flesh first, but... so be it. It would be greedy to seek out more skulls to crack when we have not finished the one in front of us."
Minsc,Oh? Minsc is wanting is to close your mouth with a kick. And you?
Minsc,"You! Boo would have recognised your foul scent, if not for all this evil Sharran incense."
Minsc,"A GHOST! Wait, no. A projection, says Boo."
Minsc,"I will help you to your feet, but you may dry your OWN britches."
Minsc,Ugh. It is only charming when BOO shows his belly!
Minsc,"If you must die weeping, then do it on your feet!"
Minsc,"... on this, we agree."
Minsc,... 
Minsc,"My hamster can smell your lies, villain. Foul not his little nose."
Minsc,Oh? Minsc is wanting to close your mouth with a kick. And you?
Minsc,No trap. Almost certainly no trap.
Minsc,"I do not know all of those words, but it is clear that Boo likes Shadowheart best of all."
Minsc,"Not just safe - she is among friends. Minsc is her friend, you are her friend, and most important of all, Boo is her friend."
Minsc,Boo wants a little look inside.
Minsc,"Of course! Boo could use an extra friend to play 'chase the Boo', seeing as none here are quick enough."
Minsc,"If there be teeth, Minsc will be upset..."
Minsc,"Ah, forgive me, Jaheira. But it is just so good to be together again!"
Minsc,"Oh, no. I speak of how they sealed Boo away, so that he would not remind me of the man he has taught me to be."
Minsc,"Jaheira, Minsc has been thinking, and Boo agrees - you are owed an apology."
Minsc,"Yes. Minsc should have charged in all the sooner - and brought a second sword, so that he might have cut all his captors down in one blow!"
Minsc,"Of course! Eh... it is the name of one of those thick histories you have given Minsc to read, yes?"
Minsc,"Now! Where is it you lay your head, so Minsc and Boo may find a spot nearby?"
Minsc,You have found fine companionship while we were apart. It is no common soul with the strength of arms to best Minsc in combat.
Minsc,"Or the strength of heart, to take his hand in friendship afterwards! Though I think this perhaps had something to do with you, yes?"
Minsc,I will save you - but only because my hamster's heart is soft.
Minsc,The hunter stalks his prey. The hamster naps until the action starts.
Minsc,"Quick Boo - sit on my skull, so the light does not betray us!"
Minsc,Yes. It is working. Evil is unnerved by the righteous composure of Minsc!
Minsc,Enough of this place. Boo wishes to sun himself once more - and now you may join him.
Minsc,"Fly, Astarions! Return to this city, and you will answer to BOO!"
Minsc,To die by the sword is just. But to end so many with only rhyming and words... Boo wonders if this is truly what you wanted?
Minsc,"Now you have had your fun. End the vampire, says Boo - and this foul magicking with him."
Minsc,Enough! We can still stop the nonsense words in his mouth!
Minsc,"To end so many with only rhyming and words... the sword would have been messy, yes. But cleaner too, thinks Boo."
Minsc,"We have no love for beasts. But to slaughter so many like chickens in coops, without even a fair hunt... it does not sit well with Boo."
Minsc,"There will be much trading of threats and insults, no doubt. But Minsc will be ready when it is time for boot to meet butt."
Minsc,"But if Minsc can become calm, perhaps evil will learn to fear his serenity."
Minsc,"She has you in her thrall, Jaheira. Minsc will still her serpent tongue, before it has a chance to twine around your thoughts!"
Minsc,The Stone Lord is no more. Boo and Jaheira and my friend would not let me stay cursed. 
Minsc,And the only terms we offer are between my boot and your treacherous buttocks.
Minsc,Boo - say BOO!
Minsc,Move! Or Boo shall get to biting!
Minsc,It is well for you that Boo's heart is as soft as his rump.
Minsc,You are no statue - with that face? Ugh. Move.
Minsc,"Done, says Boo!"
Minsc,You are not dead! You only LOOK dead!
Minsc,"Boo would squeeze through, but he just had lunch."
Minsc,Jaheira... smarter than you... smarter... than Minsc...
Minsc,...Boo...?...
Minsc,...Boo...
Minsc,Kill... Nine-Fingers... seize... Guildhall...
Minsc,...Boo! BOO!...
Minsc,...Boo... BOO... BOO!...
Minsc,Zhentarim... precious... treasure...
Minsc,Minsc... of... Rashemen...
Minsc,Such a hurry to our final moments. May I face death as bravely as you do.
Minsc,"My friend - only cowards lay traps, and Minsc is no coward, so there can be no trap. Yes?"
Minsc,"To glory, or glorious death."
Minsc,"You point, I poke."
Minsc,"Your party remains full, and Boo is shy. But we shall sniff out your camp and meet you there."
Minsc,"Truly? But... you have seen my hamster, have you not? His stern countenance, his mighty claws, his pointy teeth!"
Minsc,"To camp, then! For his heroics here today, Boo has earned the most vigorous of back-scratchings."
Minsc,"Boo and I are most adept in the doing of things. But, as you wish."
Minsc,"You have a great many companions already. There is no room for little Boo, or slightly larger Minsc."
Minsc,"You are not the leader of this merry band, I think. Meaning no offence - Boo is the boss of me, after all."
Minsc,I hope this brings you comfort.
Minsc,"He says we will join with you, and cleanse Baldur's Gate of evil together!"
Minsc,"...Once more, my hamster proves himself my greater half, and makes the path clear when my mind is fuzzier than his tiny bottom."
Minsc,"Now we are together again, all will be exactly as -"
Minsc,"Those villains locked Boo away, lest his righteous gaze cause their tadpole to flee in terror."
Minsc,Of course. How else was I to break through these walls?
Minsc,"A miniature giant space hamster. Fear not, you will learn the difference in time."
Minsc,"I have a new face to show you. But it is not a villainous one for the clawing, understand?"
Minsc,"You are right, of course. There is still much evil for Boo and Minsc to stamp out - but we need not fight it alone! "
Minsc,"As you wish. But Boo and I hope you will change your mind - before the worm changes it for you, eh?"
Minsc,"I am sorry, my friend! I am at the mercy of your faultless justice!"
Minsc,"You point, I poke!"
Minsc,Boo will do the honours.
Minsc,"Ignore them, Boo. Let them gaze deep into their own abyss, and wonder just what it is they are trying to achieve."
Minsc,I begin to grow annoyed. It is well for you that Boo does not let me learn the bad words!
Minsc,I am armed! Armoured! And entirely sick of your foolishness.
Minsc,Are you perchance a squeaky wheel in need of a kick?
Minsc,It is one thing to shame yourself in battle. But to shame Boo? I WILL NOT ALLOW IT.
Minsc,Simple is as simple does.
Minsc,"Bite it, Boo!"
Minsc,Boo will do the honours!
Minsc,Minsc would rather poke at enemy entrails.
Minsc,Boo says there is a better time - but very well!
Minsc,"Woe, Boo, our friend has fallen! Oh. You're fine."
Minsc,Now is no time for the napping!
Minsc,Dust yourself off and let Boo have a look at you.
Minsc,Stand and deliver!
Minsc,"Give it a sniff, Boo."
Minsc,A little help from my hamster.
Minsc,"Are you well? Are you well? Shall I poke you some more, to be sure that you are well?"
Minsc,"We're only looking, Boo!"
Minsc,A little shake just to see what's inside.
Minsc,I would sooner open an ogre's innards!
Minsc,"Only a flesh wound! Oh, wait - Boo sees bone."
Minsc,The knock-knock does not work. Perhaps the knock-down?
Minsc,"Feel better, says Boo."
Minsc,"Open, says-a-Minsc!"
Minsc,"Ye gods, have you no witch to heal your wounds?"
Minsc,Do not worry - Boo licked my hands all sparkling clean.
Minsc,Feel my hamster's healing touch!
Minsc,"What, Boo? Would you sooner I loot their corpse? Oh - you would?"
Minsc,"Bah, no hard feelings - for soon you will be dead!"
Minsc,My old friend Keldorn told me that the righteous must end their rage when the battle is done.
Minsc,Boo demands that you be well!
Minsc,"Yes, Orin has taken the bear-druid. But he is our comrade - and so we are going to save him."
Minsc,"Simple enough, no? So let us be about it!"
Minsc,Boo wants to reassure you that the boom was not him. It was the sound of Gale blowing up the brain. 
Minsc,"Thrice-laced, in the Rashemaar style, so that a berserker might split skulls without fear of splitting britches, too."
Minsc,"We both fight evil, wherever it is found. The who and where are less important than the hamsters you meet along the way."
Minsc,"The bards, says Boo. They conspire not to safeguard our trousers, but to rid the world of pants entire."
Minsc,"So still that wandering eye, my friend. You have met your match in the tailors of Rashemen."
Minsc,"Hah! So thought my first teacher in the berserker arts. I gulped air like a greedy ox, so she set me pulling her cart until I learned better."
Minsc,"On this matter of sharing memories, I see no reason for us to worry at one another's worms."
Minsc,"If there is more we wish to know, we can simply... ask, no?"
Minsc,I saw you - casting covetous glances at my hamster!
Minsc,"Hamster, meet hind!"
Minsc,"Is it power? True, it has made Minsc strong - Boo can scarcely get comfortable, so firm has my physique grown."
Minsc,"But what does the parasite take in return? It is a horror, wrapped in honey - stay your sweet tooth, says Boo."
Minsc,"Exactly so! If I must peer into the mind of my enemy, I use an axe. For friends, there is ale."
Minsc,I do not understand.
Minsc,"No, my friend. If you fear you have a question that Minsc cannot answer, then you can simply ask Boo."
Minsc,No!
Minsc,There is a very ancient and very wise saying that Minsc lives by.
Minsc,"To battle, Boo! Or at the very least, a brawl."
Minsc,"He who would try to control evil must beware lest evil tricks him, steals his clothes, and kicks his backside with his own boots."
Minsc,I read it on the privy wall in the Blushing Mermaid many years ago.
Minsc,Minsc does not trust it.
Minsc,"I do not think our new friend wishes to see me blubbering, Boo."
Minsc,"Minsc is normally the strong and violent type, but if you insist on hearing a sad tale, he can tell it."
Minsc,This Emperor played a very cruel trick - it made me believe that something lost had been found.
Minsc,"It came to me in dreams, wearing a face I never thought to see again."
Minsc,"You point, I punch."
Minsc,"Dynaheir. A witch of my homeland. She was to be the greatest of them, and I her protector."
Minsc,It was not easy. She was a fierce and independent cub - she did not think she needed mother-bear Minsc to protect her!
Minsc,"And she was right. The elders sent us out into the world, thinking it would teach her to bow a little."
Minsc,"But it was the world that bowed to Dynaheir, wherever she went, and Minsc blundered along behind."
Minsc,My pants.
Minsc,Oh? The mind of Minsc is a simple place. Of what strangeness do you speak?
Minsc,"Ohoho! This iciness, it will not withstand the forging fires of friendship. You will see!"
Minsc,Ah. Distressing.
Minsc,Those words are more soothing than the salve Minsc applies to the places the armour chafes. You are a kind and gentle soul.
Minsc,"You hear what our friend says, Boo? Viconia is gone for good this time!"
Minsc,"Argh! I am sorry, Boo. I will stop up my clumsy mouth and would tear out my hair if any remained!"
Minsc,"So dark an alliance sealed with Zhentish contracts, cultish vows, and a dragon's shining hoard! You think Minsc could forget?"
Minsc,Once again? In smaller words?
Minsc,This truth you seek. Boo believes that Minsc is knowing more than Minsc knows. But - it is a difficult thing.
Minsc,"There are memories of this time that Minsc does not remember. And Boo suggests that, just as he helps with tricksome itches in awkward places..."
Minsc,You must reach what Minsc cannot. The parasite - you can use it to tickle free whatever truth you seek.
Minsc,I - !
Minsc,"I much prefer your methods, my friend, but Boo is resolute. The worm it must be."
Minsc,The worm has already whipped me around the city like a slack-backed pony. I have no wish to saddle myself a second time. But...
Minsc,"If it cannot be Boo who pops inside my skull for a rummage, then I trust you."
Minsc,Or Jaheira - but she is currently possessed of an empty head.
Minsc,Argh!
Minsc,"And in the end, it was she who died - protecting me."
Minsc,"The Guild. The Stone Lord hunted them. Peeled away their rotten ranks one by one, to lay bare their corrupt heart:"
Minsc,"If you cannot believe his words, then watch his doings! We will foil the Zhentish plot - and then we will show Nine-Fingers the five-fingers of Minsc! Yes?"
Minsc,What does it matter? Cultish thinking has occupied Minsc's mind for long enough - now it is time for doing.
Minsc,And this talk of evil overthrowing evil - pah! Like a many-headed hydra biting at its own throat.
Minsc,"Bring forth the hydra, says Boo - more faces for the punching! First we pop the Zhentarim plot, then we show Nine-Fingers the five-fingers of Minsc. Yes?"
Minsc,"Until Minsc arrives, the battle is not even begun."
Minsc,"I do not often go against the advisings of my hamster, but... as you wish."
Minsc,Perhaps you might speak to the corpses you left behind. I'm sure Boo can scare a soul back into it long enough to answer some questions.
Minsc,"Does it? You have seen all there is to see of Minsc, short of stripping me down to my stitches. Perhaps I can -"
Minsc,"But no, Boo has only just made himself comfortable. Let us leave the inspection for camp."
Minsc,"Then you have a sword at your side and a hamster at hand, whenever you need them."
Minsc,Unless I die. Or you die. Or you do anything at all to upset Boo.
Minsc,"Now - does Boo see a question in your eye, or just the parasite poking through?"
Minsc,"My friend, I promise you this - you have nothing to fear from Minsc."
Minsc,"Should any of us show the slightest sign of weakening to the worm, Boo will slaughter us all in our beds."
Minsc,Nine-Fingers Keene. That is what the Absolute bought black Zhentish steel to do - to kill the guildmaster!
Minsc,"No, my friend. It is not the past I saw. But Dynaheir as she would have been. Should have been."
Minsc,"That... is in the past. It showed me Dynaheir not as she was, but as she would have been. Should have been."
Minsc,It told Minsc exactly what he wanted to hear.
Minsc,"Please, my friend. Your noble tears will not make the confessing any easier."
Minsc,"So I wonder. If Minsc can be a villain, and Nine-Fingers call herself a hero: must it be so with all creatures? Is there good and evil within us all?"
Minsc,"So I wonder. If Minsc can be a villain, and Nine-Fingers a hero: must it be so with all creatures? Is there good and evil within us all?"
Minsc,"She sometimes pets Boo a little too roughly. Or denies him the breakfast broth, so that I must dip him in the pot when she looks the other way."
Minsc,Which is why I am asking you.
Minsc,"Live by the word, die of boredom."
Minsc,"What shall we say, Boo?"
Minsc,"Catch the clicker, Boo!"
Minsc,"Where Minsc plants his boot, goodness grows."
Minsc,"Stand aside, evil! Legend coming through!"
Minsc,Boo is most adept at talking small.
Minsc,Minsc has many words.
Minsc,"I see. I ask only because... this throwing of our lot in with the Zhentarim. I can see the good in it, if I stop and squint for a moment."
Minsc,"Evil might be turned to virtuous ends. Like hoisting a goblin by the toes so that you might use him to club another, larger goblin."
Minsc,Never has Boo been more proud of my failures.
Minsc,"But a word of warning, if Minsc may: no matter how mighty the warrior, you cannot swing a goblin forever."
Minsc,Minsc's metaphor could not have been clearer.
Minsc,Then Minsc is satisfied to swing the goblin a little bit longer.
Minsc,"New friends, Boo!"
Minsc,I will speak. Boo's breath still reeks of evil's rump.
Minsc,"Die, or do not. What is this in-between foolery?"
Minsc,Minsc thought you were stronger than this. Boo did not.
Minsc,"If you must cower, then do it on your feet!"
Minsc,Come on. Jaheira said I must bring you back alive...
Minsc,I can do that. Probably.
Minsc,Easy enough!
Minsc,As if my hamster himself had told me.
Minsc,Minsc will make it so.
Minsc,"Turn the other cheek, evil - so Boo might bite this one also!"
Minsc,Says Boo - even a dull blade will break your bones!
Minsc,"Sooner or later, it comes time to set the dizzy little demon down and do battle with him all the same. Do you understand my meaning?"
Minsc,"Yes, Orin has taken the rude githyanki. But she is our comrade - and so we are going to save her."
Minsc,"My friend. Now we have settled the matter of the Guild, I fear there is something I must tell you. You and Boo both."
Minsc,A little butt-kicking before breakfast. No better way to start the day!
Minsc,"Dynaheir, hers was more the habit of teaching Minsc many new ways to say the word 'fool'."
Minsc,"Bah, I think on what she would say to Minsc now, cowering from a creature in his own skull. Fine! If you say this tadpole is a weapon, then let us wield it."
Minsc,"So long as it is still our hearts that guide us, yes? Or better yet, my hamster."
Minsc,"Minsc has made many mistakes, but he has learned from every one of them."
Minsc,The lesson is always the same - carry a bigger sword!
Minsc,"Minsc feels no shame in sorrow, mind. It is as much a part of life as breathing, or picking goblin teeth from your knuckles."
Minsc,You'll hear no argument from Boo!
Minsc,Or from Minsc. That mind-tickler has already caused me a great upset.
Minsc,"Shhht, friend. Boo does not like worms. They make his butt go itchy and take his mind from butt-kicking. We do not need these tadpoles..."
Minsc,You should stop listening to this Emperor. Minsc trusts it less than a Thayan Red Wizard.
Minsc,"On this matter, I have held small council with Boo. If the worm is lodged within our skulls, should it be not be possible to simply -"
Minsc,"Ah... pay that noise no mind. Boo has not feasted on evil's flesh in some time, and it has set his gut to bubbling."
Minsc,"None at all. Though, Boo is tiny. Perhaps he could just crawl into our ears, and - "
Minsc,"Bah. Fine! Minsc will dine on the little rock-worm, if that is what you truly wish."
Minsc,"A moment, my friend. Minsc needs to think."
Minsc,It is not a matter of Minsc trusting you. It is his stomach that might prove treacherous. But...
Minsc,It is not a matter of trusting you. It is... more a matter of trusting Minsc's stomach. But his steel and strength are still yours to command.
Minsc,"Minsc does trust you. It is only his stomach he doubts. But his strength and steel - these are still yours to command, my friend."
Minsc,Now let us speak of something else.
Minsc,"Minsc and Boo surely would, but you have so many followers already that Boo cannot pick your scent from the pack."
Minsc,Boo likes all of our party well enough - but return when there are not so many of you.
Minsc,"Minsc shall be your shadow, as Boo is his."
Minsc,As you wish! Eh... Boo? Do you know the way back...?
Minsc,"Here we stay, then. But if Boo grows restless and chews holes in all your delicates, you have only yourself to blame."
Minsc,"To camp, then. But if Boo grows restless and chews holes in all your delicates, you have only yourself to blame."
Minsc,That would take the heart from even my hamster.
Minsc,Minsc would have a word. That word is 'hello!'
Minsc,"All the better, then!"
Minsc,What is it you want?
Minsc,"Hello, friend. But forgive me - my hamster has his heart set on speaking to the other one."
Minsc,Hmmmm. Ehhhhhh. No. Thank you.
Minsc,...
Minsc,Boo forgives. You may speak.
Minsc,"Boo breaks the hearts, Minsc breaks the bones!"
Minsc,Did you think yourself abandoned?
Minsc,"You can stand a little taller than that, eh?"
Minsc,"Do not be sad, mind flayer. Even out of sight, Boo will remember you. And I will make sure he reminds me to remember you also. "
Minsc,"Why do you furrow your brow so, wizard? Boo says your abominable bat-cat has probably survived."
Minsc,"Well, my friend? What do you say?"
Minsc,"But, let the wizard wet his robes in the river, if that is his wish."
Minsc,"And all to impress a former lover. Gale should do as Minsc did, and stop at the face tattoo."
Minsc,"Well and good, but enough of that. What now? My hamster is hungry."
Minsc,"No one else wishes to say it? Very well, then. DRINKING!"
Minsc,"Though first - what of you, wizard?"
Minsc,"Minsc thinks she is owing you this much, at least. We look forward to your return - healed and pure of chest!"
Minsc,"Minsc and Boo wish you well, my friend - but think this is perhaps the way into Mystra's bad books, not back into her heart."
Minsc,"Down here, my friend!"
Minsc,A soft word.
Minsc,"Up, or Boo shall have to go a-biting!"
Minsc,"And where Jaheira goes, so too go Minsc and Boo. Goodbye, my friend."
Minsc,"Boo, he is squeaking your praises."
Minsc,I hope they carry no pocket-protector. That ferret nearly took my finger.
Minsc,My hamster made me do it.
Minsc,"Do you hear that, Boo!? Karlach lives! And this new form will make her all the slippier to grasp in our berserker bouts - a battle for another day."
Minsc,"Where Boo leads, Minsc follows."
Minsc,"My hamster, he is sticky-pawed."
Minsc,Boo's battle cry is too high for your hearing - but you should tremble all the same.
Minsc,"This is why Boo never allows such silence to fall. Prick your ears, and there is always another buttock crying out for a kick."
Minsc,Boo says it was perhaps a den of denial rather than a den of evil. Minsc says one thing is very much like the other.
Minsc,Someone hold Boo! He does not enjoy the bumpings to come.
Minsc,Someone hold Boo! He will not enjoy the bumpings to come.
Minsc,"Cometh the hour, cometh the hamster."
Minsc,"Boo says smite! That means I must hit you very hard, I think."
Minsc,"Boo is napping - so die in silence, evil!"
Minsc,"Where Jaheira goes, so follows Boo. And so follows Minsc. Farewell, my friend."
Minsc,"Silence and secrecy grow evil just as a cellar grows mushrooms. Big, plump, stinking evil!"
Minsc,That is why Minsc always speaks his mind. LOUDLY.
Minsc,MINSC IS COMING! MINSC WILL HELP!
Minsc,And the worm squirms no more! Boo need not worry that his seat on my skull will grow suddenly stickier with mind flayer juice. 
Minsc,Boo will be sad for Gale. He was the best wizard Boo ever knew. The only wizard close to Boo's power. 
Minsc,Boo will raise a statue in Gale's name. It will be the size of a planet to honour the size of Gale's courage. 
Minsc,"Yes, Orin has taken the wizard. But he is our comrade - and so we are going to save him.<br>"
Minsc,"I... do not understand your concern. Perhaps once again, Minsc is missing something?"
Minsc,Suit yourself. But Minsc will stomp his bedding down each night all the same.
Minsc,No matter. Things are not so dire.
Minsc,"Bah. When Minsc catches hold of her, it will be his kicking that shifts her shape. Unless... could she be my boots...?"
Minsc,She might have been your pillow. Or Minsc's pillow. Or Jaheira's pillow!
Minsc,On your guard! Who knows how long that slipskin serpent was hiding in our camp.
Minsc,Ugh. I have no wish to see what floaters will break about the water after out little visit down below.
Minsc,Hah! It is the heart of a berserker that beats in your chest! Shar thinks this pain is a punishment? No!
Minsc,"Now, Karlach - Boo still shivers from the sea. May he toast himself against your... Karlach? Where has she gone?"
Minsc,"We must find her, before it is too late - to camp, quickly!"
Minsc,"To camp, says Boo! She may have slipped into a new skin, but her scent still singes my hamster's nose."
Minsc,"Don't do it, friend!"
Minsc,"Don't do it, my tentacled friend! "
Minsc,No dying until the work is done!
Minsc,You are not wicked - so no rest for you!
Minsc,WAKE! UP!
Minsc,Shall I shake you some more?
Minsc,You are not alone!
Minsc,"Do not despair, my hamster is at hand!"
Minsc,Feel the backhand of justice!
Minsc,"First, the pick. Then the boot."
Minsc,Hm? Boo would know the meaning of your meaningful glances.
Minsc,"Well done indeed! Though now you will never see a god of death cower before a miniature giant space hamster. Every choice has a cost, I suppose."
Minsc,"Oh, do not be such a cynic, Boo."
Minsc,But... this boasting does not become you. 'Claim godhood'? This will make you any less a man with a half-mended heart?
Minsc,"But... his boasting is unbecoming. 'Claim godhood', he says? Will this make him any less a man with a half-mended heart?"
Minsc,"Hide, Astarion! I do not think you are going to tan!"
Minsc,"Who among us has not been spurned by a lover? But a word of advice, if Minsc may be so bold:"
Minsc,My hamster has dined on god-flesh! You are but a tiny crumb!
Minsc,"We will find a way to save her, will we not?"
Minsc,"Swallow your battle cries, fiend - and wash them down with steel!"
Minsc,Do you see the pity in my hamster's eyes?
Minsc,Good. Boo will tell you when it is good that you talk again.
Minsc,Boo will hold his nose and help.
Minsc,"Nothing personal, but Boo does not like the look of you."
Minsc,"Another Bhaalspawn, buried by our hand. Bhaal should learn better than to send his offspring against us - they might as well be babes, dropped bare-bottom into the Rashemen winter."
Minsc,"Why do we stop, my friend? There is evil somewhere with its small-pants yet unsoiled."
Minsc,"Stop wriggling, Boo, and prick up your ears."
Minsc,"Yes, my friend?"
Minsc,"Do you feel it, Boo? The path of virtue beneath my boots once more! Boo and I - we are in your debt, my friend."
Minsc,"Boo is overjoyed with our victory. Another den of evil vanquished, and an old foe defeated!"
Minsc,"Yes, Boo - a most wicked witch!"
Minsc,The very mention of her name gives him nightmares to this day.
Minsc,"Boo and Minsc have travelled far and wide, and met many fine and not-so-fine people."
Minsc,It will surprise you to learn that even the wisest of friends do not always recognise Boo for what he is.
Minsc,Exactly!
Minsc,A miniature giant space hamster.
Minsc,Boo! Do not listen! Our friend has lost their mind!
Minsc,"The drow was a cruel witch, but a clever one."
Minsc,"She knew what Boo was right away, and she had never seen his like before! She wished to inspect his handsome magnificence!"
Minsc,"And so she did! One night, while he lay asleep, twitching his whiskers in happy dreams, she crept upon his tiny bedroll holding a knife as slim as a toothpick."
Minsc,She meant to spill his miniature guts and study them!
Minsc,"Thankfully, he preserved his guts heroically."
Minsc,I did not get the chance!
Minsc,Ha! Minsc did not stop her - he did not need to.
Minsc,"Boo never sleeps deeply while evil is near. He sprang into action, and almost blinded the witch!"
Minsc,"She had fled from our camp by morning, when Boo told me the whole tale over a breakfast of berries and nuts."
Minsc,Of course! But also -
Minsc,Minsc is soft of heart. Do not make him regret it.
Minsc,"Do not be afraid, Boo! She is not here."
Minsc,"Make sure you are refreshed before we set out again, friend. The road to justice is paved with kicked buttocks."
Minsc,"What is it, my friend?"
Minsc,She is a Sharran no more - and free of her wretched and evil fellows!
Minsc,"But, like Boo, after a great struggle within, I think Shadowheart has finally brought that coin to earth."
Minsc,"Ah, forgive Minsc. It has been said that his mouth sometimes frolicks in fields far ahead of his mind."
Minsc,"You are right. The shame bubbles deep in my gut, as Boo will bear witness to."
Minsc,"As does Minsc. We are both misshapen in our own ways, but Boo loves us still.<br>"
Minsc,"Minsc and Boo would recommend a statue on the Wide, but it is not always the honour it seems.<br>"
Minsc,"You wear the flayer's face, and yet your noble soul has not fled before it! I do not know if Boo or I would have your courage.<br>"
Minsc,"I will be serious for a moment. Often Minsc speaks for his hamster, but now he speaks from his own heart, too - thank you. You saved us."
Minsc,"Boo is conflicted. He liked Orpheus, but he likes you more, and killing him seems to have made you happy. "
Minsc,"The githyanki will find they have a noble prince in Orpheus. If they do not slaughter him on sight, at least."
Minsc,"The princeling deserved a better end than this. We shall remember him, Boo."
Minsc,She hangs split between her two sides - like a flipped coin that Boo once ate while it was still in the air.
Minsc,Boo wonders if I should perhaps be carrying you instead.
Minsc,I have missed this. The adventure. The danger. The kicking of butts!
Minsc,"You will live, Karlach! It will take some time to restore your muscles to their former glory, but Minsc and Boo shall train with you, every day!"
Minsc,"Go for the eyes, Boo!"
Minsc,"You will grow to like Jaheira's incense in time. Like - chewing herbs and soap, yes?"
Minsc,Ugh. UGH!
Minsc,"You come to speak of the last time Minsc stood watch? The snoring, it was Boo! "
Minsc,"A little rest to brush the road from Boo's fur, and then back to our adventuring."
Minsc,HEY! Do not roust Boo when he is COMFORTABLE!
Minsc,"Go for the eyes, Boo! Go for the eyes!"
Minsc,Weep if you wish. Minsc will not judge.
Minsc,"You have done enough, Boo! Come and rest in my pouch."
Minsc,To glory! Or glorious death.
Minsc,Can we fight now? Boo is not used to this taking of turns.
Minsc,"To arms! Wait, no - to swords!"
Minsc,"Butt-kicking, for goodness!"
Minsc,"SHHH! Can you not see that Boo is resting? Poke again tomorrow, you monster."
Minsc,And you! Bite your tongue until your eyes water and your hairs curl!
Nightwarden Minthara,"Peel back the surface, and her madness lay beneath. She could not hide that, no matter what form she took."
Nightwarden Minthara,It was only the surface that she imitated though. The skin and the muscle and the bone.
Nightwarden Minthara,"No matter how perfect the surface imitation, few would see themselves reflected in Orin's madness. In her soul."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps I will be, one day."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now that you have your father's dark blessing, you are the master of your urges, and together we can win this fight, and become as gods ourselves."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And, of course, you saw yourself there too. She was your sister after all, bound to you by Bhaal's blood."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Orin could make herself a mirror to anyone she met. A perfect physical replica, down to the slightest blemish or imperfection."
Nightwarden Minthara,We are their doom.
Nightwarden Minthara,You know me well.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will leave you to enjoy her attentions. I hope you are strong enough to survive them.
Nightwarden Minthara,Then I am glad that you are no longer mine. You do not have the strength to satisfy both of us.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Amusing. I am not sure you have the strength to satisfy either of us, let alone both."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The wizard hoped to weave a spell around you, and make you his."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Baldur's Mouth is truly remarkable. I had thought the purpose of a broadsheet was to inform the people, but I see now that I was mistaken."
Nightwarden Minthara,I need to think on what happened.
Nightwarden Minthara,We can talk later.
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not have time for idle chatter.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hard to believe she is dead after all that she did to me.
Nightwarden Minthara,So - Shadowheart has attracted your attention. Are you not worried that the little amnesiac will forget you by morning?
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you do slip from her mind, do not come scurrying back to my bed.  "
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will be with my weapons. Come find me, if you need me for the fight."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am sure you do. It is a fine thing to build a future with somebody who does not know their past.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you are careful and cunning in your manipulations, you can make them into almost anything you wish."
Nightwarden Minthara,I think Shadowheart will require all of your attention. I suspect she is rather needy once you break past that cold exterior.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you are inclined to rekindle whatever affection there was between us, spare yourself the shame."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Young Wyll planned to court you, and to win your heart."
Nightwarden Minthara,Shadowheart hoped to share her heart with you - what little of it she understands well enough to share.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Tell me - when you kissed the wizard, could you still taste Mystra on his tongue?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Go unpick the weave with him. I will be with my weapons.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It might be a very short future. If you show him any of the tricks I taught you, he is liable to explode."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever the case, it seems Lae'zel has left her mark on you, and claimed you as her own."
Nightwarden Minthara,I think his ardour would fizzle as quickly as his spells often do if he saw us together.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Either your face is decorated with fresh bruises, or you are blushing like a lovesick youth. "
Nightwarden Minthara,Then go. There is nothing more to say.
Nightwarden Minthara,You do not need to apologise. You will be scarcely capable of satisfying my appetites - the vampire may be more easily nourished.
Nightwarden Minthara,All I ask is that you do not let your roving lusts distract from our goals.
Nightwarden Minthara,I suspect that would puncture his fragile ego far more savagely than his fangs puncture your neck.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Astarion likes to put on a show of nonchalant decadence, but he is as delicate as a flake of snow."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Besides, that arrangement would not suit me either. I am not delicate, but I do not share what I desire."
Nightwarden Minthara,And I did desire you.
Nightwarden Minthara,You will be much sorrier if you continue to talk. Go. There is nothing more to say.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We enjoyed one another for a while. Sometimes that is enough.  Now go, there is nothing more to say."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A little, but it will fade."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you should not have begun another.
Nightwarden Minthara,"In Menzoberranzan, I had a thousand suitors. Some were only attracted by my status, many only wanted my body - a rare few wanted all of me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The more they pursued me, the less I desired them. I tired of them all. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Here, with you, I enjoyed that there was no pursuit, and there was no status. We simply were."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then you must tell the wizard you belong to me. I am sure he will survive - after all, he has been rejected by a goddess in the past."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You have your charms, but you are far from divine."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you must wound poor Karlach's heart. As if it were not broken enough already.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Good. Do not stray again - you belong to me, and I to you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then you must tell Lae'zel of your decision. If she is displeased, I will gladly teach her not to touch my property again."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you must give up any hopes of marrying into the Ravengard family. Tell Wyll of your decision.
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you must tell Shadowheart of your decision. Do not worry - the sorrow of loss may be a fulfilling religious experience for her.
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you must tell Astarion you are no longer on the menu.
Nightwarden Minthara,You have nothing more to say? Fine.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If he does bite too hard, do not come whimpering to me. He can drain you for all I care."
Nightwarden Minthara,"While we breathe, we must fight. No surrender."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Embracing your illithid self may give us the greatest chance of dominating the brain, and taking control."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would like to test both aspects of your character when next you find yourself alone at night.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I cannot tell if you are more a deviant or a debutante, Shadowheart."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I may not weep for my home, but I would take a mushroom over a flower any day."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am a daughter of House Baenre. I obey no authority except my own desires.
Nightwarden Minthara,The excess of refugees outside the city walls could easily become a surplus of labourers.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The Ducal Council must have sprung a leak, for we seem to find barrels of the stuff everywhere."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Amusing as it is to provide children with such lethal toys, surely there are better uses for this powder?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Good - you are awake. I want to taste your fear.
Nightwarden Minthara,No. I'm a survivor.
Nightwarden Minthara,It's time - kill them!
Nightwarden Minthara,It is time! Kill him!
Nightwarden Minthara,It is time - kill her!
Nightwarden Minthara,It is time - kill them!
Nightwarden Minthara,You've played your part. The glory for this victory will be mine alone.
Nightwarden Minthara,"But you will be, and soon. I am curious to see if you survive."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then you have chosen. Whatever you truly are, you will die before you can do anymore harm."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you do not belong to the Absolute.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I take no pleasure in what I must do. In another life, I would have taken you as my consort in Menzoberranzan."
Nightwarden Minthara,I believed for a moment that we might share a path. But I still sense that absence inside you... and I fear it.
Nightwarden Minthara,"In time, I believe we may be together."
Nightwarden Minthara,I wish that were true. But I still sense that absence inside you... and I fear it.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I must admit, some of the items here are quite marvellous."
Nightwarden Minthara,To become a mind flayer while retaining your sense of self would not be a sacrifice - it would be an evolution.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They can also make people more protective, guarded, paranoid, and jealous."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I shall be careful not to ask you then, child."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When we return to the surface, there is no telling what carnage the brain will have wrought. We must be ready for all-out war."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But do not think of endings - think of the glorious battle to come, and rejoice that we have a part in it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We are in the midst of a battle against a being that can kill worlds with a thought, and we are still standing."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am faring exceptionally well given the circumstances.
Nightwarden Minthara,I think our odds have improved greatly now that you have accepted your full illithid potential.
Nightwarden Minthara,I have felt your mind at the edges of my consciousness ever since we met.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is no longer confined to the edges. Now, it is an immensity that surrounds me. My tadpole hungers to join with it, and I envy the power that it gives you."
Nightwarden Minthara,Nothing can stop us.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I know that we can. If you have doubts, rid yourself of them - they are infectious.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,The way is open. Let us go to war.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Does your blood sing as mine does, my love? There is no time for words - let us join the battle.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"While we still draw breath, we cannot lose hope, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,There is little time for words - we must join the battle.
Nightwarden Minthara,Apologies if your heart raced more than it normally does after our last kiss. A trace of toxin clung to my lips.
Nightwarden Minthara,I take small doses of various toxins with my meals to build immunity. You should do the same.
Nightwarden Minthara,A mild poisoning is the least of the risks you take when choosing to share your body with me.
Nightwarden Minthara,She will see her failure to seduce you as a stain on her honour. I know I would.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your devilish patron is a delight, Wyll. Have you ever lain with her?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"You confound me, Wyll. You have all the illustrious iniquities of a warlock, and you choose to impress your partner with dancing?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"That was due to your insipid conversation, half-elf."
Nightwarden Minthara,What sweet relief to shelter from the sky for a while.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I break them, it will be in the pursuit of pleasure, and they will die smiling."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am surprised to see you standing. I thought Astarion might have sucked you dry by now.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Astarion is so used to playing the nocturnal hunter, he thought you would make for easy prey."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is always thrilling to know that something you own is desired by another.
Nightwarden Minthara,"My oath is broken. I still hold to the tenets of vengeance, but I am no longer bound by any word of vow."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am more interested in power than penitence.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Not true. While our bond holds, and we have a common enemy, I serve your cause too."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Free of my oath, I am more capable than ever of achieving our goals."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Once I have had my vengeance and the Absolute is ours to control, people will pledge an oath to our cause. Conquest, and dominion."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then speak.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Not directly. My memories were not removed, they were obscured by the Absolute's voice - by its presence."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The tadpole is a conduit for that voice, not its origin, and while the Prism protects us, the Absolute cannot reach us."
Nightwarden Minthara,"As for the tadpoles themselves, for the moment I do not believe they are malevolent. They are incubating within our brain-matter, not feeding on it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If they were, we would all spend our days in a berserk rage, and our nights talking to hamsters."
Nightwarden Minthara,Is there a reason you chose me as your confidante in this matter?
Nightwarden Minthara,"I take pleasure in harming my enemies, but I do not kill for the joy of it. Only when it serves my ambitions to do so."
Nightwarden Minthara,As you should. But I am not sure that I can trust you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They are the mad, lost to all reason, and subservient to nobody. Even Lolth, malicious and brutal as she is, cannot abide them."
Nightwarden Minthara,"They kill, and cannot say why. So they are destroyed, for the greater good."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When you speak to me of yearning and urges to kill, I fear you are like them - controlled by a bloodlust that you do not comprehend."
Nightwarden Minthara,Killing is necessary. It is good that you can take pleasure in it.
Nightwarden Minthara,Just be sure that your urges do not lead you astray - we have enemies enough for you to sate your lusts on. 
Nightwarden Minthara,We do not need to make more because you indulge your every murderous whim.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would kill you without hesitation.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If it ever takes you, I will be there to put you down."
Nightwarden Minthara,We are all that stands between this world and annihilation.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If it is, then your own death may be the only cure. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Abandon your preconceptions of who I am and why I act, and know this - my fight against the cult is righteous."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is not noble, it is necessary. If we do not destroy the cultists, they will destroy everything."
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes. I only know it through history books and hearsay - a city of murder and grief.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is already living up to the legend.
Nightwarden Minthara,I expect it will live up to its legend.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You did not falter, you freed yourself. Your oath is a burden - let it go."
Nightwarden Minthara,Not before time. 
Nightwarden Minthara,How do you feel?
Nightwarden Minthara,You are a survivor.
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. I sensed you had the courage to find your own strength - I am glad you have proven me right.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We stand against gods and abominations, and so far we have proved their equals. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Unshackled from whatever redundant principles held you back, we can transcend them."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I took up my oath  long ago, when I swore bloody vengeance against any who defied Lolth. Now, I myself have sinned against the Spider Queen."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Though my faith is shattered, my oath endures. I am sworn to destroy all those who serve the Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I have had my vengeance on the cult, I do not know if my oath will still hold."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do know that when I take the Absolute's power, I will not lose control of it as our enemies have. I will harness it to create a more perfect world. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Any who object to the laws of that world will have no place in it, of course, and I will gladly eradicate them."
Nightwarden Minthara,"What of your oath, paladin? Are you true to it?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Then break it. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"We are threatened by murderous gods, and otherworldly entities that despise our very existence."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When you made your oath, you could not have predicted this dark path we now follow, or the things that would be asked of you."
Nightwarden Minthara,You cannot allow yourself to be held back by an ideal.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do you think me a fool? If it were blood I wanted, I would choose easier victims rather than challenging gods and cosmic aberrations."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But for you to even speak of this to me shows that if there is a madness in you, it does not own you yet."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If it ever does, I will kill you without hesitation."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not have violent urges, I have violent intentions."
Nightwarden Minthara,Karlach will take pleasure wherever she can find it. Her life is too short to do otherwise.
Nightwarden Minthara,I can afford to have stricter expectations. I do not share anything that I desire.
Nightwarden Minthara,"In times of crisis, it is not wise to horde resources - everything must be put to immediate use."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Has Wyll proposed marriage yet, or are you just one more frontier for his blade to tame?<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever the case, I suggest you slip back into his arms and out of my sight."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps he will sheathe his blade, and dedicate himself to your happiness one day."
Nightwarden Minthara,"For all his rugged charm, Wyll is a man of tradition. He would not share you with a Duke's daughter, let alone an exile from the Underdark."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And besides, I do not share what I desire."
Nightwarden Minthara,I cannot imagine it was an easy thing to reject Lae'zel's advances.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are bold to seek me out after sharing your affections with another.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Are those bite-marks on your neck, or did you contract some unpleasant rash from the vampire?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Of course I am. But you no longer have me, and you never will."
Nightwarden Minthara,"As long as you do not let your lusts distract you from the fight, we do not need to speak of this again."
Nightwarden Minthara,Hurt me? You aren't capable. But you have disappointed me.
Nightwarden Minthara,A poor choice.
Nightwarden Minthara,I can understand why you would choose a Duke's son over an exiled daughter of Menzoberranzan.
Nightwarden Minthara,You were incapable of raising yourself to my standards - perhaps you will have better fortune lowering yourself to Karlach's.
Nightwarden Minthara,What little I know of githyanki courtship suggests Lae'zel will not wish to share you. And nor do I.
Nightwarden Minthara,The wizard? Of all people?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Shadowheart likes to keep secrets, but the two of you could not keep this from me."
Nightwarden Minthara,I advise you to walk away while you still can.
Nightwarden Minthara,"She will die, you will grieve, and then you will be alone."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you intend to be with her, do not fool yourself into thinking it is more than a brief dalliance before her fire is extinguished for good."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Unlike Karlach, I will recover."
Nightwarden Minthara,You should hurry back and warm your hands on her heart. Mine is altogether colder.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If somebody angers me, I hurt them not because I lose control of my temper, but because it teaches them not to anger me again."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If somebody causes me sorrow, I remove their ability to do so again. If that involves removing their head, so be it."
Nightwarden Minthara,But I do not lash out or strike without reason.
Nightwarden Minthara,A mistake. I am your most valuable asset.
Nightwarden Minthara,Of course. I belong in battle.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When you realise your mistake, I will be ready to join you again."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Celebrate our victory. We have earned the Absolute's favour, but She will ask more of us soon."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Begone, insect. I have found somebody more deserving."
Nightwarden Minthara,The goblins are your responsibility tonight. I have other matters to attend to.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Wait until morning, True Soul. All will be revealed."
Nightwarden Minthara,"She will test you. If you fail, you will break; if your faith is strong, you will become something greater than yourself."
Nightwarden Minthara,How disappointing for you. I could have shown you ecstasy.
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. I will join you when you go to your bed. You are mine.
Nightwarden Minthara,Give your body to me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you already have doubts, you would only have disappointed me. Get out of my sight."
Nightwarden Minthara,Are you ready to give yourself to me?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Celebrate as long as you please, but save your strength. There will be no rest tonight - your body is mine."
Nightwarden Minthara,Already regretting your decision? I hope you're ready to beg for my company.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Cast off one of the lessers who trail behind you, and I will gladly stand at your side."
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. I do not like to stand idle. 
Nightwarden Minthara,You look well. Are you ready to pursue our enemies?
Nightwarden Minthara,I thought you might be in flames the next time I saw you. Karlach's touch has that effect on people.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"You have already chosen a distraction for the night, I see."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then steel yourself. If you are uncertain, you will not even survive the journey."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When we next meet, we will be together in the Absolute's presence, and She will make us Her champions."
Nightwarden Minthara,Go to him when you are ready. I will lead what remains of my forces to Moonrise ahead of you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Though I am proud, I prefer exile to death."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I want you as much as I ever did, but our bond is based on ambition as much as affection. I am not sure that our goals still align."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We can survive this together, but I want more - I want us to rule together. To master the brain, and to become Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,Do you have the courage and conviction to do what is needed when the time comes?
Nightwarden Minthara,I do. But I also know that what I am asking of you is not an easy thing.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When the time comes to take control of the cult, there will only be me and you. Everyone else is expendable."
Nightwarden Minthara,That is how it must be. You cannot think otherwise.
Nightwarden Minthara,I cannot. Too often you lack the conviction to make the hard choices.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Show me your resolve in actions, not words."
Nightwarden Minthara,"What would we be then? Survivors, with nothing to show for our struggles but trauma and scars?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Since Moonrise - since you saved me from the cult - I have made it clear to you what I want.
Nightwarden Minthara,Control. Power. To become Absolute. 
Nightwarden Minthara,I have been open about my intentions because I cannot work with those I do not trust.
Nightwarden Minthara,And I cannot love those who lack ambition.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you do not feel the heat of my passion, it is because you no longer ignite it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am not cold when I spill the blood of our enemies, or when I dream of conquest. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Be part of those dreams, as you once were, and you will taste my fire again."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And when the fighting began, he led his troops from the front and cut through the enemy like a scythe through stalks."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Blows and arrows rained down on him, and before long his face was a mask of blood. But he did not fall - he did not even falter."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When we won the day, Ketheric's armour was bent and shattered, but his flesh was unmarked."
Nightwarden Minthara,I have lived long enough to know that few things are impossible in this world.
Nightwarden Minthara,"For my people, to reject Lolth is to reject life. I am apostate, and would be executed."
Nightwarden Minthara,Ketheric's power is a rare thing though. I have never seen its like.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you had seen my city's splendour, you would not ask the question. I will miss it until they day I die."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes. My House trained me to be a soldier in Lolth's service, and my mother showed me how to survive the perils of society."
Nightwarden Minthara,You have my sympathy.
Nightwarden Minthara,I had hoped my influence would help tame your chaotic mind. It appears not.
Nightwarden Minthara,A disturbing admission. I would rather die than lose control of myself again.
Nightwarden Minthara,You have never visited?
Nightwarden Minthara,Most likely.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are of aristocratic blood? I thought as much.
Nightwarden Minthara,"But whatever House matron you sprang from, your upbringing cannot compare with mine."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am a Baenre, born into the city's most ancient and powerful house. My life was one of privilege and danger."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Like you, I lived in Qu'ellarz'orl, high above the city's sprawl."
Nightwarden Minthara,Nonsense.
Nightwarden Minthara,"From the still, dark waters of Lake Donigarten to the black academies of Tier Breche, it is a city of wonders... and terror."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But it is not my home anymore. If I were to return, I would be denied all of its wonders, and shown only the terror."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am a daughter of Menzoberranzan's most ancient and powerful House, the Baenre. I lived a life of privilege and danger."
Nightwarden Minthara,"My home was at the tallest point of Qu'ellarz'orl, the Place of the Nobles, a plateau high above the city's sprawl."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I enjoyed every luxury, whether harvested in the Underdark or stolen from the surface, and I survived my first assassination attempt while I still suckled at my mother's breast."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I tasted her blood that day. She covered my body with her own, and a blade bit deep into her chest, almost puncturing her heart."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I came of age, she tried to take my life herself, and I gave her fresh scars to match those she earned protecting me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I expect so. If the world were to end, I think my mother would survive to rule over the ruins."
Nightwarden Minthara,"She taught me to be resilient, and to guard my heart from those who cannot be trusted. Literally and figuratively."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I choose to let somebody close, I do not do so lightly. "
Nightwarden Minthara,That gives a great depth of meaning to the bonds I do share.
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes. Particularly when the home was so magnificent.
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is a connection to this Nighsong of Balthazar's, whatever - or whoever - it might be. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"We must find it, and destroy it."
Nightwarden Minthara,The necromancer Balthazar is Ketheric's chief advisor. One who has mastery over the dead may well be able to help the living cheat it. 
Nightwarden Minthara,We had barely begun to eat when she spoke for the first time. I only caught one word - my name.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then, quick as lightning, she climbed onto the table, a dagger in each hand, and skipped toward me, slicing the throats out of my men as she passed them."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If it had been an option, I would have."
Nightwarden Minthara,Few things frighten me. Orin is one of them.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ketheric held me still. His hand on my shoulder, the grip tight enough to crack the bone. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"When Orin stood before me, she touched the dagger to my eye, drawing out a tear of blood."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You've seen the horrors of the colony. Orin kept me there for days. She forced me to watch as my men were processed; some for food, others as thralls."
Nightwarden Minthara,And then she placed the tadpole in my eye herself.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I was. I deserved what happened to me, for my passivity, for my weakness. For my pride."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You know the rest as well as I do. There were massacres before the Grove - religious communities, mostly. Those who refused to convert."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then there was you, and now there is freedom."
Nightwarden Minthara,Soon there will be vengeance.
Nightwarden Minthara,That is certain.
Nightwarden Minthara,Perhaps I deserved what came after the welcome as well.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is a mistake I hope never to repeat.
Nightwarden Minthara,"No. I was prepared for combat, but I intended to strike subtly."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I thought so too. This world is full of fools, after all."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But in this instance, I was mistaken. Our visitors were not fools - they were bait."
Nightwarden Minthara,Recruited. You could call it that. I intended to wage war on their god and the rest of its presumptive followers.
Nightwarden Minthara,One part of it.
Nightwarden Minthara,A smaller part than I had hoped.
Nightwarden Minthara,It was the pale woman at the foot of the table - Orin the Red.
Nightwarden Minthara,It was not the food I should have been wary of.
Nightwarden Minthara,"He invited me to the head of his table, as his guest of honour. I was wary, of course. If I had been in his position, the food would have been poisoned. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ketheric proposed an alliance between Moonrise and Menzoberranzan. I admit, I was captivated by him. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"He is usually in his laboratory, elbow-deep in offal, or clinging to his master's side. If he left Moonrise, his mission must be urgent."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We should ransack his chambers, and see what secrets he keeps for the great General."
Nightwarden Minthara,"No, we need to hit him smarter. This battle, like most, will be won or lost before the fighting begins."
Nightwarden Minthara,Every chance once he is stripped of his power.
Nightwarden Minthara,"A true soul came to my city preaching a message of togetherness, accompanied by two novices."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Menzoberranzen is not fertile ground for such messages. I killed them, and hanged their bodies in my garden."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would have picked prettier corpses if my intentions had been aesthetic. This was a warning against heresy.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I was not content with the warning though. I intended to wage war on their insolent god, and the rest of its followers."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even as the flesh sagged and sloughed away from their eyeless skulls, their audacity infuriated me. I had to know where they came from."
Nightwarden Minthara,And whoever sent them was counting on my curiosity overcoming my caution.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would rather die than endure it again.
Nightwarden Minthara,Indeed. A man you know all too well - General Ketheric Thorm.
Nightwarden Minthara,The dead cough up their secrets just as well as the living.
Nightwarden Minthara,"All it took was a simple act of necromancy, and the corpses told me where I needed to strike - Moonrise Towers."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is never safe to point out my shortcomings.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"But in this instance, you are correct. Moonrise is the site of my greatest failure."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Despite Ketheric's best efforts, so are we. And we shall outlast the immortal general, and his tower."
Nightwarden Minthara,But he had the upper hand when we first met. I was arrogant enough to believe I had the better of him.
Nightwarden Minthara,"As it turned out, to my shame, I was defeated without even drawing my weapon."
Nightwarden Minthara,I came to Moonrise with a retinue of warriors and assassins - the best House Baenre had to offer.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I expected a battle, but found a fully-laden feast table, and a welcome befitting a house matron."
Nightwarden Minthara,I recognise my flaws - pride is certainly among them.
Nightwarden Minthara,"In a manner of speaking, I did."
Nightwarden Minthara,It was. But it has left a bitter taste.
Nightwarden Minthara,And I do not need lectures on responsibility from somebody who does not know their own mind.
Nightwarden Minthara,They were not my actions.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you tire of their company, come to me. I may have other uses for you yet."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When you tire of their company, come to me. Tonight, you are mine."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You fought well. And so did these creatures, thanks to our leadership."
Nightwarden Minthara,The githyanki should encourage relations between their soldiers. It is a proven tactic for morale.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You fight harder than ever now that you have a lover to protect from harm, Lae'zel."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Next time, tie them to the ground, and do not release them until you are both satisfied."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A few pointers, Lae'zel. I heard you and your lover locked in combat, but the test you set was not rigorous enough."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am yours. Come to me.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are exquisite.
Nightwarden Minthara,I have never needed anyone. But I want you.
Nightwarden Minthara,You give me courage.
Nightwarden Minthara,What a wonderful distraction you are.
Nightwarden Minthara,I could lose myself in you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Enough. We still have a war to fight.
Nightwarden Minthara,"He is rather fond of himself. If he truly intends to be the saviour of Baldur's Gate, perhaps he has reason to be."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even if I personally faced down the Army of the Absolute, and drove it from the city single-handedly, I would not be welcomed as a saviour."
Nightwarden Minthara,"No matter what I do, the people of Baldur's Gate will always see me as an enemy."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A faultless observation, Lae'zel. Are all githyanki so quick to come to the essential point?"
Nightwarden Minthara,How curious. The shadow curse has not touched this place.
Nightwarden Minthara,Extinguish it? I intend to seize it. Power exists to be wielded.
Nightwarden Minthara,We drow are sensitive to psionic power. And this place throbs with mental power such as I have never known.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Wake up, True Soul. We must talk."
Nightwarden Minthara,They seek to promote peace between species through mutual understanding. Ha.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I watched over you as you slept, peaceful and silent, and I spoke to our god. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is something missing in you, and I do not understand it. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"I warn you - he is quite mad, but he knows the path to Moonrise better than anyone."
Nightwarden Minthara,"His minions will wait for you at the mountain pass, on the threshold of the shadow curse."
Nightwarden Minthara,"He was a drow once. Now he is an abomination, a victim of Lolth's cruelty."
Nightwarden Minthara,"This harp will summon him. Play it when you are in the shadows, and he will come to you and know that you are a friend."
Nightwarden Minthara,But I can protect you. A wretched creature in my service can guide you through the curse.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,The land around Moonrise is cursed. Travelling there will sap your strength and your sanity.
Nightwarden Minthara,With difficulty - but I can help.
Nightwarden Minthara,"She will test you. If you fail, you will break; if your faith is strong, you will become something even more beautiful."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I know a way, yes. Soon, you will be in the Absolute's presence."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Wrong. The Absolute brought you to me, and now She will take you into Her presence at Moonrise."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The Absolute has spoken to you already, in whispers, but at Moonrise you will be in Her presence."
Nightwarden Minthara,"To gather our forces in this region. They're ill-disciplined - without a strong hand, they'll disperse."
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not know - but I do know that She allowed me to spare you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When you meet Her at Moonrise, She will show you Her design, and your part in it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If She wanted you dead, I would not spare you. You live by Her grace."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Travel to Moonrise. We will meet again there, at the heart of the Absolute's power."
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. I believe you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"She told me to decide your fate, to determine if you are worthy. If you are, I am to send you into Her embrace, at the seat of her power. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"But then a miracle happened. As I took out my blade, Her voice returned to me... and She told me what I must do to purge myself of doubt. "
Nightwarden Minthara,And so I decided that you must die.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When the Absolute failed to answer me, I feared that you had somehow infected me with that same absence."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I asked Her why She had chosen you, made you one of Her faithful, when you are so clearly broken. Beautiful, but broken."
Nightwarden Minthara,The Society of Brilliance! These preposterous fools love to meddle in Underdark affairs - they are most amusing.
Nightwarden Minthara,"On this plane, the story always ends the same way. Order collapses, and shadows take the light."
Nightwarden Minthara,"These people seem soldiers by their bearing. What say you, Lae'zel?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ominous, yet austere. This place has its charms."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not want to be tolerated, I want to be feared. Don't you?"
Nightwarden Minthara,From the cult and the illithids? Of course. And then I suspect I want exactly what Gortash wants.
Nightwarden Minthara,To be feared. Isn't that what you want?
Nightwarden Minthara,"When we have all three Netherstones and control the elder brain, all of Faerûn will have reason to fear us."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes they would. But I am the lesser of several evils, for now at least. I want more - don't you?"
Nightwarden Minthara,I agree. What matters is that they respect us... and fear us.
Nightwarden Minthara,Was Baldur's Gate enjoying a golden age of prosperity and peace before Gortash rose to power? I think not.
Nightwarden Minthara,This city is like a wild beast. It needs a strong hand to choke it into obedience.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Gortash may have that strength, but he chose the wrong allies to rule alongside him."
Nightwarden Minthara,True. His mistake was choosing the wrong allies.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ketheric was reliant on his god instead of his own strength, and Orin does not understand power and control. Only blood."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps you should rule in his place. Your choice of allies is exemplary, after all."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am reluctant to share power, but if he is amenable to it, an alliance with Gortash may be beneficial."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Together, we can teach this city to fear us, and that is just the beginning."
Nightwarden Minthara,Given his position in the city's power structure that may be easier said than done. I advocate for caution.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I was the Absolute's dagger. I remember every throat that it held me to, and every drop of blood it forced me to spill. "
Nightwarden Minthara,I take no responsibility for the lives I took. I did nothing in the Absolute's name - I was merely a weapon that it wielded.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The tadpole... the Absolute... they work together like a drug. I did not feel I was compelled to act against my will, I felt ecstatic to serve."
Nightwarden Minthara,Every action seemed a deliberate choice - the best choice - even though I could no more have resisted its commands than flesh can resist decay.
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute can make the impossible seem inevitable.
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not blame him. It is not the sort of place servants or spawn should sully with their presence.
Nightwarden Minthara,Devoured by the darkness. They should have retreated while they had the chance.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You do not need luck to survive, Astarion. Not when you have me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Did you expect to survive Myrkul's wrath, little spawn?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"And what do we do with rats, Lae'zel? We hang them by the tails, and burn their warrens."
Nightwarden Minthara,There is no true authority in this city. The guards are more degenerate than the criminals.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Have you ever been afraid, Karlach? Truly afraid?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Better to shut off the carnal desires than indulge them. They are distractions.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You allowed that smith to meddle with your heart, Karlach, simply so you can be touched?"
Nightwarden Minthara,This place is foul. Drow would not tolerate rivers of waste flowing so close to their residences.
Nightwarden Minthara,You have the aura of a third child about you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"In Menzoberranzan, after a house has two sons, every subsequent male-born child is slaughtered at birth, as it is useless, even for breeding."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do you have elder siblings, wizard?"
Nightwarden Minthara,All I will say on the matter is that you were wise to lower your standards from the godly to the ghastly.
Nightwarden Minthara,You have been protected from the worst of the Absolute's influence. Understanding what was done to me is beyond you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You've been smiling like a fool of late, wizard. Explain yourself."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Our illithid warns us away from what lies beyond that gate, but perhaps it underestimates us."
Nightwarden Minthara,The rashes and sores you may have contracted over your decades of philandering are not the kind of curse that concerns me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The shadows have lingered here so long, the land itself is corroded. A most persistent curse."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If they have prevented your eyes and fangs from wandering to other necks, it must be a special bond indeed."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Would you ever consider sharing the gift of immortality with me, Astarion?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Are you a better man now that you are loved, Astarion? Did they mend your ways?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Hrmmph.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You would fit right in with them, Astarion."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Half the men of Menzoberranzan are pleasure-servants. Weaklings, whose beauty is their only redeeming quality."
Nightwarden Minthara,Greater horrors await us in Baldur's Gate. Best sharpen your fangs.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Watch your tongue, spawn. I need the illithid alive - you are expendable."
Nightwarden Minthara,Even rational minds like ours cannot reject such a powerful influence.
Nightwarden Minthara,I have been told that I am special since my mother first held me in her arms. The burden of expectation.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your family is a little too cut-throat, even for me, child of Murder. But we can certainly rule together."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We do not need to trust Viconia, we only need to know which side she will take in this conflict, and that is clear. "
Nightwarden Minthara,She will take our side because it best protects her interests.
Nightwarden Minthara,Neither the Zhentarim or the Guild are capable of running this city as they should.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Once we have conquered the Absolute, perhaps we can turn our attention to dissolving the criminal elements of Baldur's Gate, and replacing them with our own candidates."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Hear me, wizard. You cannot go through with Elminster's ludicrous plan.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,Destroying the Absolute before we fully understand it would be madness.
Nightwarden Minthara,"To serve the gods is always a choice, and to martyr oneself for them is insanity."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are a wizard, are you not? Surely you have an obligation to learn about the world and all of its mysteries rather than destroying them."
Nightwarden Minthara,I'm glad you see reason. To martyr oneself for the fickle gods is insanity.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are welcome to explode wherever and whenever you please, as long as you do not destroy anything of value."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I, for one, will miss the shadow curse. For all the pain it caused us, it did at least obscure the incessant sun."
Nightwarden Minthara,This place is wondrous. A shame it is not ours to command.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I must ask you something. First, let me make it clear that I do not object to the killing of Isobel, or the loss of Last Light."
Nightwarden Minthara,Sometimes I think you are quite mad. Other times I think you still hold on to a slim fragment of your sanity.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will be watching you - and watching for this 'butler' of yours as well.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We paid the price for your thrills when the shadows surrounded us. If you must kill for the pleasure of it, select your targets more carefully."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would prefer if you informed me of your intentions before striking in future.
Nightwarden Minthara,I prefer strategy to instincts and impulses.
Nightwarden Minthara,I see. The end does justify the means. Be that as it may...
Nightwarden Minthara,Your father - the Lord of Murder - offered you all of the powers of death and carnage. Powers that we will need before this fight is through.
Nightwarden Minthara,And instead you have chosen to sever yourself from the legacy of blood that was your inheritance. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"If she were here, Shadowheart would remind you that we are hardly trustworthy ourselves."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I was ready to rule by your side, Slayer. But you have given up a most glorious and dishonourable birthright. We are finished."
Nightwarden Minthara,She has been exiled from the Underdark for more than a century. She would not have survived if she were not willing to fight.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You insult me. Viconia left the Underdark to rule a clergy of mournful waifs, and peddlers of secrets. I have far grander ambitions."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is better to accept that, and to make sure she is ready to fight to the last."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Unnerving though it is, if we are to face an elder brain, we could have no better ally than an illithid. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"The Emperor is the reason we have made it this far, and if the gith prince's suffering is the price of our survival, so be it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is sad to see how Jaheira has neglected her family. They should be prepared for the battle that is coming, or they may not survive it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If any child of mine spoke of me as disrespectfully as Jaheira's offspring speak of her, their lives would be exceedingly short."
Nightwarden Minthara,"My mother taught me to talk, to walk, and then to kill. I still hope to thank her by teaching her how to die one day."
Nightwarden Minthara,"All things considered, my relationship with her may not be the best model to follow."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Gothic. Decadent. Vulgar. I can see this place had quite the influence on your tastes, Astarion."
Nightwarden Minthara,Gothic. Decadent. Vulgar. This place clearly had quite the influence on Astarion's tastes.
Nightwarden Minthara,I had thought Cazador little more than a decadent slave-driver and stalker of the night.
Nightwarden Minthara,This is it. The end of everything - or our moment of triumph.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Patricide is often the first step toward greatness, but I hope Wyll does not regret sacrificing his infernal powers."
Nightwarden Minthara,"No matter how desperate the fight becomes, stay the course. We will not fail. We will dominate."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Myrkul, Bane, Bhaal, and now Shar? Are there any gods who do not want the Prism?"
Nightwarden Minthara,No matter - they will all be disappointed. Lord Ao the Overgod could not take it from us.
Nightwarden Minthara,Bhaal should be begging me to join his ranks.
Nightwarden Minthara,I was unsure of our alliance with the Sharrans - betraying Shadowheart seemed a steep price to pay - but I accept the wisdom of it now.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Despite my antipathy to Viconia, I am sure she will aid us when the time comes."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Two hundred years ago, she disgraced her family - the DeVirs - by refusing to obey a divine order from Lolth. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"It was quite the scandal, and I was young enough that it left an impression on me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I admire those who challenge authority, but Viconia fled from her troubles rather than facing them."
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not mean to diminish her achievements entirely though.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You have seen a god reanimate the bones of his Chosen, you have seen an entity capable of commanding legions with a thought."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You have seen the fires of the Hells, and the devils who dwell there."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you believe love is a greater power than all of that, you are stupider than I feared."
Nightwarden Minthara,Vengeance is a bitter pill for kind souls. I pity Karlach that she could not savour Gortash's death.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Indeed. When my time comes, I will not go quietly."
Nightwarden Minthara,"For her sake, we should not. And besides, celebrations can come later - our fight is not over yet."
Nightwarden Minthara,"She will be ready to right when we need her, I am sure of it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If the devil truly holds an artefact that can free Prince Orpheus, we cannot ignore it. Any ally who can aid us against the brain is worth having."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even when the faithful abandon them, sacred places do not lose their power. Be on your guard."
Nightwarden Minthara,The darkness here reminds me of home - so does the danger. Be on your guard.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Z'rell said we should begin our search at the Thorm Mausoleum. It is north of the House of Healing, deep in the shadows."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would advise a thorough search of Balthazar's chambers at the tower before delving into the mausoleum. Any knowledge we can find may arm us for what is to come.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If we meet again, kill me quickly if you can. I prefer oblivion to enslavement."
Nightwarden Minthara,"No... worse than death. If I leave, if I am not protected from the Absolute's voice as you are, then it will take me again. Body, mind and soul."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I leave, I die."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Lolth has discarded me, and the cult of the Absolute abused my mind, and stole my body. If you stand against them, you stand with me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Spare me your sanctimony, druid. You kill to preserve your natural order, do you not? Or are the claws and fangs simply for show? "
Nightwarden Minthara,I have no quarrel with you.
Nightwarden Minthara,It was the Absolute that directed my hand toward your grove - the same Absolute that I am sworn to destroy now that I am free of its influence. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"Doubtful. Like everything else in these lands, its original purpose has been corrupted by the shadows."
Nightwarden Minthara,Something lingers there. Something that inspires terror among those cultists unfortunate enough to have glimpsed it while patrolling the area.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They dare not enter. Naturally, anything that frightens them intrigues me. We should investigate."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ketheric himself was entombed there for decades. An undying man, sealed in darkness with the bones of his ancestors."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would have thought he'd seen enough of the place for several lifetimes, but he still visits on occasion."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You will realise, soon, how little you need her. Or you will die, mourning a loss that has no meaning."
Nightwarden Minthara,"She infests your notion of the weave, just as the Absolute's voice infested my thoughts."
Nightwarden Minthara,"She has made you believe that you need her. That is what the gods do. In truth, she is not so different to the Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now stop sulking and practise your spellcraft. We have a city to save, and an elder brain to master."
Nightwarden Minthara,It would have been a mercy - at least I'd have been spared this drivel.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you have any strength left, bring it to the battlefield. You certainly do not have enough to share my bed anymore."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is the perfect time for whatever was between us to die.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You rejected the extraordinary, and for what?"
Nightwarden Minthara,The only reason you ever lost control is because you resisted the truth - rejected the glory of your true self.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Bhaal gave you an opportunity to embrace your savage birthright, and to tame it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The relationship between gods and mortals will always be one of subservience, but you could not hope for a finer master than Bhaal."
Nightwarden Minthara,He gave you an opportunity to embrace your savage birthright and to tame it.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Without the promise of your blood, I fear you have lost part of your strength that you can never regain."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you need a pat on the head and a scratch behind the ears, I am sure Minsc will provide. Boo has him well-trained."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Hope lives in the imagination. I prefer to deal in reality, and in our reality, Karlach is dying."
Nightwarden Minthara,Talk to Jaheira if you wish to hear tales of heroic Bhaalspawn and their past victories. She likes filling peoples' heads with noble ideals.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would prefer to cut your throat, and finish what Bhaal could not."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But you may still be effective, even in your diminished state, and we have precious few allies in this battle."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If it's congratulations you want, I am sure Karlach will provide. The language may be foul, but the feeling will be fair."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you want mindless praise and affection, find Scratch. He will nuzzle your hand and follow at your heel no matter how disappointing you are."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I deal in reality, not idealism, so you will have to seek praise elsewhere. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"I hope Elminster's message has not left you feeling dejected, wizard. It is better for you to be free of Mystra."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now, return to your books. We have a city to save, and an elder brain to master."
Nightwarden Minthara,Oh? Are you suddenly incapable of touching the weave? Do your spells fizzle before you can cast them? I think not.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are Gale, Wizard of Waterdeep, and with or without Mystra, you are as great a practitioner of magic as anyone I have ever known."
Nightwarden Minthara,There has never been a need to.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you want empty platitudes and a rousing, gallant speech, young Wyll Ravengard may be able to provide it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps a particle of sentimentality remains in Ketheric, and he mourns for his family. I do not know."
Nightwarden Minthara,You cannot seriously believe that?
Nightwarden Minthara,"She is a fierce ally, and has survived great torments and challenges already. We would be fortunate to have her with us until the end."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would like to be among them - I think there is much we could learn from one another.
Nightwarden Minthara,The wizard? No.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is pointless. In my experience, the moment they leave their libraries, wizards have the life expectancy of a gnome in a war. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Either the enemy recognises they are a threat, and kills them swiftly, or their curiosity leads them to combust while experimenting with the limits of magic."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Present company excluded, of course. I am sure you will live to a ripe old age."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Gale, however, is already in a state of suspended combustion thanks to that orb between his ribs."
Nightwarden Minthara,I suspect it is only a matter of time before he goes up in smoke.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will reserve my social graces for those who might live long enough to appreciate them.
Nightwarden Minthara,Our wizard is already in a state of suspended combustion thanks to that orb between his ribs. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"Don't sulk. I admire your mastery of the weave, but I have known many wizards."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Their mastery of the weave is commendable, but they are poor conversationalists. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"In my experience, they do not usually live long enough to make the effort of befriending them worthwhile."
Nightwarden Minthara,"He is exceedingly self-righteous. Amusing, considering he bound himself to a devil."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Wyll doesn't just have blood and dirt on his hands, he has stains on his soul. Those last more than a lifetime."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is as it should be. Purity of soul and deed will not help us to survive the Absolute.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would rather be allied with a warlock than the spoiled son of a noble who has more experience with diplomats than devils. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am not judging, I am making an observation."
Nightwarden Minthara,The devil makes Wyll strong. What would he be without her?
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will take your word for it. I only care that he is a good soldier, and he has not disappointed me on that front."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then do not suffer him. You do not need to like a man to fight alongside him effectively - and Wyll is a good soldier.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have never known anyone so ferocious and unassailable in battle, and yet so fragile and impermanent in their very being."
Nightwarden Minthara,"For now, I will continue to observe you in battle. There is a precision to you approach that I admire."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I often think of mortality as a curse. In time, all that I am and all that I have known and learned will be lost. In time, our cities will be dust."
Nightwarden Minthara,"In time, I would know your poetry, your art, and your philosophy."
Nightwarden Minthara,Meeting you and Lae'zel makes me wish I knew more of your culture.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Rebels swarm to my cause, and even if it takes centuries, I will reclaim my House in Menzoberranzan, and make the Spider-Queen bleed."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Were I to take a lover from the Faerûnian pantheon, I assure you it would not be the runt of the litter."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Greetings. Does your cloister thrive, Shadowheart?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you ever need advice, do let me know. I have experience leading treacherous cults."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The key is to ensure your followers rely on you, but cannot rely on one another. That way, they cannot unite against you."
Nightwarden Minthara,I need do nothing to ensure you are no threat to my ambitions.
Nightwarden Minthara,I tire of feuding with the gods. 
Nightwarden Minthara,You and Lady Shar may claim the souls of Baldur's Gate. I will focus my attention on material things.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I like you, child, but I will not give my allegiance to a god."
Nightwarden Minthara,But I promise not to interfere with your activities.
Nightwarden Minthara,You need not thank me for advice.
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you have been chosen by the wrong goddess. Poor child.
Nightwarden Minthara,I offer it freely. Do with it as you wish.
Nightwarden Minthara,There is a fanaticism in the Lolthsworn that lends itself to chaos. They turn their blades on one another as readily as on outsiders.
Nightwarden Minthara,The gith have stricter hierarchies and stronger commitment to a single cause. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever culture you and I once shared, it no longer has a hold on me, Lolthsworn."
Nightwarden Minthara,You still listen to the whispers of the Spider Queen's web. I only obey my own heart's desires.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Most gith do not seem to know their own hearts, nor do they need to. They have strict hierarchies, and commitment to a single cause."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Some, like Lae'zel, question that cause. But even so, she retains the discipline of her training."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even now, infected and far from home, Lae'zel stays true to the cause. That shows resolve."
Nightwarden Minthara,I no longer listen to the whispers of the Spider Queen's web. I only obey my own heart's desires.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes. Even separated from your people, you have the habits of a soldier. I see it in your stance, and in the way you care for your gear."
Nightwarden Minthara,Karlach does not seem to have such anxieties. Perhaps because she cannot afford to. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"She exists in the moment, and she will burn out and be gone in a moment. There is something very beautiful about that."
Nightwarden Minthara,"She is intelligent, strong, and capable as both a leader and a fighter. An impressive woman."
Nightwarden Minthara,We have done Umberlee's will. Now let us stay far from the depths of her dread domain.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If we stop to talk, we will be food for the fish."
Nightwarden Minthara,"While she lives, Orin will continue to terrorise us, and soon she will make good on her threats. She thinks we are weak, afraid, vulnerable."
Nightwarden Minthara,We need to prove her wrong.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Despite my antipathy toward Shar and her devotees, I feel honoured to fight alongside a Dark Justiciar. Their power is legendary."
Nightwarden Minthara,Even the intervention of their gods can't save these chosen from our vengeance. We defy divinity. 
Nightwarden Minthara,We are unstoppable. I feel like we could conquer the hells.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We came here to find Ketheric and the Absolute, not Wyll's devil-mistress. We must press on."
Nightwarden Minthara,This city has one too many self-righteous Ravengards. I would have preferred Wyll cut his family ties.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Our victory is at hand. We cannot falter now, no matter what is required of us."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will fight alongside Minsc, but if he so much as refers to my butt, let alone attempts to kick it, I will skewer that damned hamster of his."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am loathe to admit it, but if we can pacify Minsc he may be a worthy companion."
Nightwarden Minthara,Any man who can resist being digested by a mimic may even give an elder brain food for thought.
Nightwarden Minthara,We cannot allow Gale to go through with Elminster's ludicrous plan. Destroying the Absolute before we fully understand it would be madness.
Nightwarden Minthara,The Orphic Hammer may be the key to our survival. I for one would be glad to avoid complete ceremorphosis.
Nightwarden Minthara,I have been watching you more closely than ever since the night we were forced to restrain you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I believe you have your urges under control, for now, and that you may become the master of them."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But if you so much as think about harming me, I will pluck the thought from your mind, and then your heart from your chest."
Nightwarden Minthara,That is all.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am concerned for Karlach. She is strong, but even her courage may falter now that she knows how little time remains to her."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then that is what we must do. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"I only survived Orin's sadistic games because she allowed me to. Even if we find her soon, I doubt the child Yenna will be in one piece."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will gladly help Astarion to destroy his enemies, but I hope he does not expect me to call him Lord.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will gladly help destroy your enemies, Astarion. But do not expect me to call you Lord."
Nightwarden Minthara,My sense of self-preservation outmuscled it on this occasion.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is a shame that she devotes all of her talents and experience to the futile cause of the Harpers. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Their devotion to preserving 'balance' is pathetic.
Nightwarden Minthara,That notion is a lie amplified by the weak to preserve their feeble grip on the world.
Nightwarden Minthara,"There are organisations like the Harpers in every realm, and every culture. I despise all of them. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"They fear change, and would rather maintain mediocrity than face the risks and challenges that progress demands."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would rather break the world and build it anew than be satisfied with its imperfections.
Nightwarden Minthara,Precisely. Preservation and balance are an excuse for inaction and stagnation.
Nightwarden Minthara,"He would despise me if he had the wits to understand me, but as long as he believes we have a common cause, he does not see beyond that."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am not so sure.
Nightwarden Minthara,I think he is happier than we are - it is his enemies you should pity.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is not sentimental to appreciate a warrior's strength, or a companion's courage."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I did not have my schemes, I would hardly know where to aim my boot."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Slaying as great an enemy of my people as Minsc would normally be a great victory, but he was just another puppet of the cult."
Nightwarden Minthara,There was no honour in killing him while he did not know himself.
Nightwarden Minthara,We have done Umberlee's will. Now let us never return to the depths of her domain again.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Karlach is willing to become illithid so that we need not make that sacrifice. We should not stand in her way.
Nightwarden Minthara,Killing one's parents can be an important rite of passage - a usurpation of their place in society.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Though she does not remember what she has done, the child Shadowheart became a proud woman today. And a strong leader."
Nightwarden Minthara,My memories of this place are grim. The reality is worse.
Nightwarden Minthara,That was horrendous. I would rather yank Tiamat's tail than travel beneath the water again.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have something of a feline nature. I do not like getting wet, and I will gladly scratch out your eyes if you annoy me."
Nightwarden Minthara,Agreed. Leave the waters to the fish and the aboleths.
Nightwarden Minthara,"As we saw when he acted as the Stone Lord, Minsc is a dangerous tool - a powerful weapon without a mind to guide it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps it was. If so, it is a madness that fits me well."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But if Balthazar's mission has taken him to the Mausoleum, we will find more there than bones and memories."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ketheric recognised me as a soldier, and took me into his army immediately. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Despite the destitution, there is profit and opportunity to be found in such places if one is willing to wade through the squalor."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I take its head, how will it learn from its mistakes?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even here, a child deserves a second chance."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It would have been prudent to ally ourselves with Gortash. While Orin lives, she is the greatest threat to our survival."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I had hoped the wizard may be intrigued by the arcane power of the shadow curse, but it seems he rejects it."
Nightwarden Minthara,Would that be the same Mystra that is responsible for his plight? I am sure she has his best interests at heart.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is frustrating that he is so incurious. I believe he is capable of greater things than he realises.
Nightwarden Minthara,Our young cleric would have us believe she has found joy now that her parents are free.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I see her grimace when Shar wracks her soul though, and I see the doubt in her eyes as the pain causes her to doubt the path she has taken."
Nightwarden Minthara,Every breath here is painful - do not waste effort on idle words.
Nightwarden Minthara,"In destroying the scroll, Jaheira has shown her readiness to give up the fight. We must not follow her example."
Nightwarden Minthara,Raphael can beg for a deal all he wants - the Crown will be ours.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Be cautious. The slightest mistake here could cost us our freedom, or our lives."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Not in the tower itself. There is more here than we see, but my mind only holds fragments of my time here."
Nightwarden Minthara,The memories are as dark and elusive as a cloaker.
Nightwarden Minthara,"His chambers are on the upper level of the tower, but he rarely occupies them. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"I think he is beyond the need to sleep and dream, just as he is beyond death. His time is occupied in higher matters."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When he is not with his troops, he is usually at the rooftop chapel, where he communes with the Absolute, while surveying his army from above."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Access is forbidden to all but his closest advisors. Even if we were among them, it would be suicidal to approach him while his power holds."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If not here in the tower, then close by. Surely you can feel its presence too?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I was held in the prison, I felt an overwhelming hunger, as if I were suspended above a great maw, eager to consume and absorb me."
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't be naive. Half of the people here have been greedily eyeing our belongings since we arrived.
Nightwarden Minthara,"That was the Absolute, and I sensed it is powerful enough to swallow the tower whole if it chooses to."
Nightwarden Minthara,Half of the children here are already mutilated by poverty and starvation. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"Shadowheart was a fine cleric, but if her obsession with Shar is more important than the task at hand, we are better off without her."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Devils, Dukes and Blades all must, as common people come to dust. Farewell, young Wyll. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"We must press our advantage while we can. Slaughter every cultist, and clear a path to the rooftop."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have rarely dealt with devils, but Raphael does not seem dissimilar to the aristocrats of Menzoberranzan."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Like them, he will be true to his word, should we do as he asks, but he will stand to gain more than he gives."
Nightwarden Minthara,What fun I would have if I could play with Wyll as Mizora does.
Nightwarden Minthara,I thought the vampire spawn would have needed an invitation to enter.
Nightwarden Minthara,"That is no excuse for letting my guard down though. We must follow their trail back to Cazador's estate, and save Astarion while there is time."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We should hang up their remains as a warning to Cazador that you are under our protection, Astarion."
Nightwarden Minthara,We should hang up their remains as a warning to Cazador that Astarion is under our protection.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If our travelling companions continue to make poor choices, we will soon have every god in this plane and the next hunting us."
Nightwarden Minthara,Lae'zel risks everything with her childish rebellion.
Nightwarden Minthara,Wyll would be wiser to leverage his family name for a position of power in Baldur's Gate than to roam the wilds like some errant ranger.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Vengeance can be a bitter pill for a kind soul such as yours, Karlach. I pity you, that you can not savour Gortash's death."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Indeed. When my time comes, I do not think I will go quietly. Nor should you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I understand. If I had been told my death is close, as you have, I would rage. "
Nightwarden Minthara,Do as I would. Spend what time remains punishing our enemies.
Nightwarden Minthara,We need your strength to survive what is coming. I vow that you will have mine for as long as you can draw on it.
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. I have little of it to spare.
Nightwarden Minthara,The Crown of Karsus will be ours - the devil cannot have it. We must negate our deal with him by any means possible.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You embrace your illithid self. Good - to deny it is as foolish as denying any other possible advantage, whatever the source."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The shadows will take this place eventually, with or without our interference."
Nightwarden Minthara,The next urchin that tries to pick my pocket will lose its hand.
Nightwarden Minthara,We walk on unholy ground.
Nightwarden Minthara,Must we talk? The heat is unbearable - my mouth is as dry as a dust devil.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Lae'zel risks our safety. If she attracts the ire of Vlaakith, we will all suffer."
Nightwarden Minthara,Who would dare oppose the Slayer?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Loving another is not soft, wizard. It is one of the hardest things a person can do."
Nightwarden Minthara,Indeed. I have been dosing my partner while they sleep by my side.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They refuse to take it in their food, but I must build up their immunity in case we ever visit Menzoberranzan together."
Nightwarden Minthara,An astral projection. It is just like a DeVir to avoid facing danger in the flesh. They always were a family of cowards.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I stayed with her while the poison did its work, and whispered words of comfort as she slipped away."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I adored her, and had been sharing her bed for some time when the order came that she must die. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"She was a high priestess of House Vandree. Beautiful, elegant, ruthless."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I took my first lover before you were a spark in your father's eye, child."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Here on the surface, gender does not define one's role so strictly. There are weaklings of every sort."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We are all dust or ash in the end. Make your enemies burn while your heart still beats, and it will be a good life, no matter how brief."
Nightwarden Minthara,"In Menzoberranzan, romance is commonly a luxury enjoyed between women. Men are mostly present for propagation."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Take the power you are owed, Astarion. Whatever the cost."
Nightwarden Minthara,No different than burning out an infestation of vermin. It was well done.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you release those ravenous starvelings, the city's poorer quarters will be their feasthall.<br><br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes, Astarion. Take the power you are owed, whatever the cost."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your scars are exquisite, Astarion. A dangerous weapon, and a work of art."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Claim your due, Astarion, no matter the cost. Kill them all."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You have unleashed a horde of monstrous starvelings. Have no doubt, the city's poorer quarters will be their feasthall.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,The spawn will not feed in the Underdark - it will eat them alive. Good riddance.
Nightwarden Minthara,Come - we have exhausted the limited charms of this place. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Such power.
Nightwarden Minthara,Duk-tak. You are wondrous.
Nightwarden Minthara,Sometimes you disturb me. And I am not easily disturbed.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You ruled this place once,  and you shall rule it again."
Nightwarden Minthara,It does not surprise me that your faith in Shar was based on a lie. You will have your vengeance.
Nightwarden Minthara,It does not surprise me that Shadowheart's faith was based on a lie. Deception is the sum of Shar's design.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am surprised you have time to bother me, wizard. You seem to be spending most of your hours pining after Mystra again."
Nightwarden Minthara,You would do better to harness the power of that shadow magic than to destroy it.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The gods are fickle. Mystra will tire of you again, as she did before. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"While we travel together, your business is my business. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I see you squandering your talents to serve a god rather than indulging your intellectual curiosity, I cannot help but be disappointed."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then we have something in common.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have been spurned by two gods, and am an exile from my homeland. I needed a home, and hoped you could be that for me."
Nightwarden Minthara,But I was mistaken. To stay with you would be death.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Shadowheart may not have gained status from her parents' death, but she has freed herself from Shar's influence. There is comfort in that."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am accustomed to leading, not following, and your decisions of late make me regret ever joining with you."
Nightwarden Minthara,Your idea of leadership is intolerably naive - your decisions will lead us to ruin.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Correct yourself, or you will wake to find me gone, or to find my knife at your throat once more."
Nightwarden Minthara,Gortash controls the population with words as well as steel. Most cunning.
Nightwarden Minthara,A bastion of blood. This can only be the home of Bhaal.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Dark, gloomy, blood-scented. It is almost like home."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I presume this is where the real business of the city is done, while the politicians squabble above."
Nightwarden Minthara,Shar's followers are a little too solemn and grim even for my tastes.
Nightwarden Minthara,"These wretches should be put to use building new homes, not occupying those that already exist."
Nightwarden Minthara,That machine is exquisitely engineered. I have never seen the like before.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever horrors lurk here, Orin will be their vile mistress."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you continue to disappoint me, I will find my own path. Alone."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Some True Souls are not fit to go to war. They act as guards in these lands, or spread the cult's influence through more insidious means than conquest. "
Nightwarden Minthara,It is amusing to hear that the Legendary Ranger has become as much a terror in his own city as he is in the Underdark.
Nightwarden Minthara,My people tell tales of Minsc and his ferocious hamster Boo to frighten our children.
Nightwarden Minthara,I believe we are only beginning to understand what he is capable of.
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes. And also more intriguing.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes, but I know your name. His often escapes me."
Nightwarden Minthara,I always thought wizards were curious beings. Your attitude is rather dull.
Nightwarden Minthara,I agree. It is a wizard's curiosity that drives them to greater heights.
Nightwarden Minthara,I have heard much of the cunning and caution of the Harpers. Clearly those tales were exaggerated.
Nightwarden Minthara,Their entire network in the city has been infiltrated and undone by a handful of imposters.
Nightwarden Minthara,Little wonder the surface world is in such disarray if they are among its protectors.
Nightwarden Minthara,We need to get out of here. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Astarion was a powerful ally. It was foolish to sacrifice him for the favour of the craven Gur.
Nightwarden Minthara,A monster may be precisely what we need if we are to survive what is coming.
Nightwarden Minthara,We will regret his absence.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am not opposed to killing an ally who has outlasted their use, but Astarion had become a formidable weapon."
Nightwarden Minthara,When am I not?
Nightwarden Minthara,"We can trust Karlach to do what is needed, but she must do it quickly."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your past is revealed to us, Chosen of Bhaal. How does it feel, to know who you truly are?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Allow me to process it for you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We believed we were all victims of the cult of the Absolute, but now we learn that one of us was an architect of this grand religious hoax."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You helped to create this conspiracy. That means you may be the best person to help us control it, and the key to our victory."
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. We will both have our vengeance on Orin. All that we need argue about is which one of us has the pleasure of opening her throat.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Once she is dead, we can seize control not only the Temple of Bhaal, but the cult of the Absolute as well."
Nightwarden Minthara,"What you call 'corruption', I call 'empowerment'. "
Nightwarden Minthara,Are you so afraid that you cannot see what an opportunity this is? You could be our salvation.
Nightwarden Minthara,The wizard has become slightly less insipid and a little more insidious of late. The change suits him.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Shar was right to punish your transgression, child, but she should not have discarded you so cruelly."
Nightwarden Minthara,"First, I fought alongside him, and then I was given a command of my own. That is where we first met."
Nightwarden Minthara,That I was willing - honoured even - to lead a pack of goblins in the Absolute's name is proof enough that I did not know my own mind.
Nightwarden Minthara,Ketheric is working from the same principle. He raises his army in shadow so none may know the extent of his power until it is too late to resist.
Nightwarden Minthara,"To kill Ketheric, we must strip him of the power that keeps death from claiming him."
Nightwarden Minthara,We know that power has its source in a relic - the Nightsong - and we know that Balthazar was responsible for its creation.
Nightwarden Minthara,He was looking for the Nightsong inside the temple. We should return there and see what we can discover.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Allying with that maggot-infested wretch makes my skin crawl, but if he can help us to secure the relic, so be it."
Nightwarden Minthara,We must pick up his trail at the Thorm Mausoleum.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The relic Balthazar seeks may be the key to this. He is not only Ketheric's closest advisor, but an accomplished necromancer. "
Nightwarden Minthara,The necromancer Balthazar should be our next target.
Nightwarden Minthara,The kind of man who sees death as a problem to solve rather than an inevitable truth.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We should return to Moonrise and search his chambers thoroughly - if we can learn anything of the relic there, it may arm us for what is to come."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ah, the wizard. I could not help but notice that you have been exploring new avenues of knowledge recently - I approve."
Nightwarden Minthara,Fascinating.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Continue to indulge your curiosity in the pursuit of new power, and I might deign to remember it."
Nightwarden Minthara,I could not agree more. The pursuit of knowledge and power should always be our goal.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not let the laws or scruples of inferior minds stand in your way.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then we have something in common, wizard, for I do not care about yours."
Nightwarden Minthara,Something is different about you. Did you change your diet?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Shadowheart looks different. A change of diet, perhaps?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Wyll would be wiser to leverage his family name for a position of power in Baldur's Gate. The hells can have him for all I care.
Nightwarden Minthara,Shar has discarded young Shadowheart like a broken toy. The gods are ever fickle.
Nightwarden Minthara,This rite of ascendance suggests he is far more impressive and ambitious than I realised.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Does your ambition match his, Astarion? You have risen from slavery already - perhaps you can complete your ascension."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am suggesting that you consider the possibility.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever her reasons for doing so, Jaheira's choice to keep the scroll shows that she is not ready to give up her fight."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Lae'zel was wise to slay the githyanki rebel. We have already angered enough gods, we need not anger Vlaakith as well."
Nightwarden Minthara,Show no mercy. We must cleanse this place.
Nightwarden Minthara,Speak quietly. Shar's agents will be listening.
Nightwarden Minthara,We have attracted Umberlee's wrath. Let us be sure not to take any long sea voyages in the near future.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Where Ketheric has gone, madness and horror await. Steel yourself - we must follow."
Nightwarden Minthara,The elder brain is close. Be ready for anything.
Nightwarden Minthara,Lorroakan's the type to cower behind contraptions and cantrips rather than facing danger. He has about as much spine as a grey ooze.
Nightwarden Minthara,Dame Aylin is likely to tear him in half if she learns of his plans. We should tell her immediately.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Orpheus believes it is his destiny to prevent the Grand Design. If he is willing to become illithid to do so, who are we to stand in his way?"
Nightwarden Minthara,It is good to have friends in high places. We should keep the future Grand Duke Ravengard close.
Nightwarden Minthara,The gith god-queen is dreadful to behold. I understand now why Lae'zel admires her.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We should not have held you back from your destiny, child. I am sorry.<br> "
Nightwarden Minthara,Shadowheart could have been so much more than we have allowed her to be. This was not the time to hold her back. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"This place is almost untouched by the squalor of the surface. If I ruled this city, this is where I would make my home."
Nightwarden Minthara,"This better be important. Every time I open my mouth, I taste the feculence of this place. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"We were wise to ally ourselves with Gortash. While Orin lives, she is the greatest threat to our survival - we must hunt her down and eliminate her."
Nightwarden Minthara,An underground city of villains. It's almost like being home again.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Murder, oppression, conspiracies. This city has its charms after all."
Nightwarden Minthara,I never believed her until now.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you cannot see the appeal of bloodshed and danger, perhaps you should retire from adventuring and farm root vegetables for the rest of your days."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would live forever if I could. Death is not rest or relief, it is only ever a form of defeat."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do what must be done. Become illithid, and we can end this."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We must destroy him in his lair before he completes the rite, and becomes a threat not just to Astarion, but to our own designs on the city."
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes I am. It is the bats that would make a meal of her.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then you should reacquaint yourself with the taste of rat-blood, since you may well be a spawn again before long."
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not be craven. He stole your life. You deserve more than revenge - you deserve to take everything from him.
Nightwarden Minthara,Explain yourself. Or is your tongue too-scorched from exploring that hellhole to form words?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Lies. If you were so easily manipulated, I would never have admired you as much as I did."
Nightwarden Minthara,Leave. I have killed greater lovers for smaller betrayals than this.
Nightwarden Minthara,There would be no more 'you' if I were not containing my anger.
Nightwarden Minthara,I no longer care what you want. You had me - and now you have lost me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would enjoy punishing your body almost as much as I have enjoyed loving it, but I need you intact for the fights to come."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I were being dramatic, I would take a knife to your most sensitive parts, and ensure you could never use them again."
Nightwarden Minthara,Would it be a mistake if my dagger were to find your heart? I think not.
Nightwarden Minthara,"'Beware loud men with purple scalps and ugly rodents, for they think of you as evil, and will kill you on sight.'"
Nightwarden Minthara,"More than a little. I would love to see her naked body bound to yours by barbed chains, as you both bleed out in a spider-pit."
Nightwarden Minthara,Tedious labour does not only suit the dead. Plenty of surface-dwellers are suitable for little else.
Nightwarden Minthara,Ketheric's undead legions carve paths through the foliage when they pass. It grows back stronger though.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You're young, child. If you survive as long as I have, you will witness greater horrors than this. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"The hierarchy of command is not yet clear, child. Can you be sure the illithids are in control?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Efficient. We have much to learn from one another.
Nightwarden Minthara,Tell me about these methods.
Nightwarden Minthara,The sensation is contagious. Which should we oppose?
Nightwarden Minthara,The moment it can hold a blade. It may even test its resilience against some common poisons while it is still in the womb.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They did not do it for love. They did it for my prowess in combat, as well as coitus. I excel in both."
Nightwarden Minthara,"In the Underdark, we have packs of winged hounds to deal with vermin like your precious Tara."
Nightwarden Minthara,The devil might just be the last 
Nightwarden Minthara,I feared that returning to the Underdark as an apostate of Lolth would be an act of madness. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"Either way, the city's future is assured. I will make it my home, and in time, Waterdeep, Neverwinter and the rest... they will be my vassals."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You may observe my works, if you lack sufficient occupations of your own. But do not interfere, unless you wish to learn how fleeting divinity can be. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then I have misunderstood you, and myself."
Nightwarden Minthara,Go. We will not speak of this again.
Nightwarden Minthara,I did not expect to meet another outcast from the Underdark who understood me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Until my time in the cult of the Absolute, I had spent little time on the surface, except to raid and pillage."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I did not expect to find any outside the Underdark who saw the world as I do, and wanted from the world what I want."
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not need to - I want to. You fascinate me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When we first met, I did not think we would ever share anything more than an uneasy alliance, born of our mutual enmity for the Absolute.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,I agree.
Nightwarden Minthara,A feeling.
Nightwarden Minthara,Wait. Let me speak.
Nightwarden Minthara,A disparate collection of vagabonds and strays. Did you have anyone particular in mind?
Nightwarden Minthara,"She is tolerable, but her faith in the Lady of Loss is poisonous."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your divine puppeteer is just as toxic as Shadowheart's, my little marionette."
Nightwarden Minthara,"One day, the strings will snap. And then you will either learn to walk without aid for the first time, or you will rot where you fall."
Nightwarden Minthara,The Nightsinger has some admirable qualities - far more than her insipid sister - but her followers are repressed.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Take the child, Shadowheart. She does not even know who she is, but still manages to pity herself."
Nightwarden Minthara,The very concept of Sharran worship is self-indulgent. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"They would have you think every whispered word and hidden thought is of value, but it is not so."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have performed a thousand interrogations, squeezing out the most-guarded secrets held in heart, mind and soul."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I can tell you this - when the trivial parts have been whittled away, and I have sifted through what remains, in most cases a person amounts to nothing at all."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It would have been better for us had she embraced Shar, and claimed the power of the goddess."
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not need to like myself - and you need not like me either - for us to exact vengeance on those who infected us.
Nightwarden Minthara,But it is better for Shadowheart to be free of that poisonous influence.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then perhaps you are right to keep it from me. I may not know what I am, but I know what I want."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Fine. Perhaps it is for the best that your thoughts stay hidden. I may not know what I am, but I know what I want."
Nightwarden Minthara,You are different - a pleasant surprise. One of the first in my long life.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Before the Absolute, I lived a life of certainties. I knew that I was destined for greatness because I was born to it.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,I also knew that my inherited privilege came with a cost - that the bonds of fellowship and family could be broken by envy and ambition.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I could not enjoy the taste of food for fear of poisoning, and I could not enjoy the company of lovers and friends because I feared they hid knives behind their smiles."
Nightwarden Minthara,"In spite of the danger, I was happy. I knew myself, and I understood the world around me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now, nothing is certain."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Without Lolth, without the Absolute... without my home. I do not know myself. But you do, I think."
Nightwarden Minthara,Show me myself through your eyes - let me see what I am to you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have never lacked confidence, but this conflict seems so much bigger than the two of us... it frightens me. I do not know if we will survive it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But whatever life remains to us, I would gladly spend it fighting at your side. And lying with you at night."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Tonight there will be no voices, no orders, no gods... I belong only to you.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,As you wish. It is a rare occasion when I do not get what I want - but you have shown your worth in many ways.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will be satisfied to have you as an ally.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We need one another as allies, but I want more from you than that. I want all of you."
Nightwarden Minthara,Now you can have me instead.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We need to trust one another if we are to survive, but I want more from you than that. I want all of you."
Nightwarden Minthara,We are both survivors. But I hoped you saw me as more than that.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I must be a greater monster than the Absolute to survive it, then I shall be. Perhaps one day, if you survive too, you will realise that I had no choice."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even honest words can obscure meaning. Thought and feeling are pure, without artifice."
Nightwarden Minthara,Let me see.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not think anyone can be the mirror to their own soul, and even if I could, it is your view of me that I want to see."
Nightwarden Minthara,That is enough.
Nightwarden Minthara,He's been deprived of freedom and strong blood for so long that he is addicted to both.
Nightwarden Minthara,"While those addictions have their hold on him, he is still a slave."
Nightwarden Minthara,No. He is well aware that I would exsanguinate him entirely if he flashed his fangs at me.
Nightwarden Minthara,That is wise. None of us would have survived the battle against the Absolute if we had not stood together.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Once the fight is won, of course, you must dispose of those allies who threaten the new order."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Never you, Lae'zel. That is all you need to know."
Nightwarden Minthara,"That is why your victory is assured, and why it will usher in a new age for your people."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I did not think you an idealist, child. You can be sure that some of those who stand with you already have their hearts set on Vlaakith's vacant throne."
Nightwarden Minthara,"They will not hesitate to claim it, and your strength is already a threat to them."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You will learn this, or you will die."
Nightwarden Minthara,"As do I. Some would think it impossible to challenge the githyanki lich-queen, but I know you are equal to it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Nothing is beyond you, and if Vlaakith has any sense at all, she will dread your coming."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is earned. The young warrior I first met was desperate for the approval and favour of her queen. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"The woman who stands before me now will strike down that same queen, and win the favour of her entire people."
Nightwarden Minthara,You will become a legend.
Nightwarden Minthara,If you were not afraid you would be delusional. Harness that fear. It can make you strong.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You may not realise it yet, but when you were a young warrior desperate for the approval and favour of Vlaakith, you knew nothing but fear."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Fear of rejection, fear of failure, fear of not living up to the impossible expectations of a mad queen."
Nightwarden Minthara,That fear was imposed on you. The fears that you have now are yours.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When bards sing of our victory against the Netherbrain, those who hear it will think the story is an exaggeration, or a work of the imagination."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Is this world truly your home now, or do you still dream of a life among your own people?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Only the fortunate and the bold are able to live the life they choose. I am happy for you.
Nightwarden Minthara,You may try.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You earned their trust, their affection, and their loyalty. That is your strength, child."
Nightwarden Minthara,Tell me - how goes your war against the tyrant queen?
Nightwarden Minthara,"You look well, Lae'zel. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"You may be right, but I cannot help but wish we had tried. That is in the past though."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We can write our own stories now, and leave our mark on these Realms."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Free? What purpose does he have that does not involve his Master? He fears him, he hates him, he dreams of him - and he will either kill him, or die trying."
Nightwarden Minthara,Astarion is no more free of Cazador than you or I are free of our tadpoles.
Nightwarden Minthara,He will only be free when Cazador is dead. And that is as it should be.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When the time comes, we must hope that he does not only take Cazador's long life, but the power that has sustained him as well."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But Astarion is not only bound to his needs and desires, he is still bound to something more powerful - his Master."
Nightwarden Minthara,I have encountered few githyanki in my life. Those that I did were raiders - they croaked out pleas for mercy in their alien tongue as they died.
Nightwarden Minthara,Meeting Lae'zel makes me wish I knew more of their culture.
Nightwarden Minthara,I did. She told me that she has nothing to teach that cannot be learned through observation of her prowess in combat.
Nightwarden Minthara,Perhaps she is right - she certainly cuts a striking figure in battle. There is a precision to her ferocity that I admire.
Nightwarden Minthara,"To one who only sees the surface of things, perhaps. You should look deeper."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You should be. On those rare occasions when people have surprised me in the past, I received new scars to remember them by."
Nightwarden Minthara,"In spite of her youth, there is a patience and precision in Lae'zel's thoughts and actions that I admire. "
Nightwarden Minthara,I think I am beginning to.
Nightwarden Minthara,"So here we are. A gathering of allies at a cold campsite, with no servants to attend us, and few luxuries to enjoy."
Nightwarden Minthara,We could have been conquerors... we could have ruled these Realms as gods. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Do you ever regret that we did not take control of the Netherbrain?
Nightwarden Minthara,Do you think of all rulers as monsters? Conquest need not end in blood and ashes. You could have built a greater world than this.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I shall not dwell on the past though. The future is unwritten, and rich with possibilities."
Nightwarden Minthara,True. But what better revenge could there be than enslaving the abomination that was the author of my torment.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Hmph. If your mind is still so rigid after all it has suffered, there is little point in trying to change it."
Nightwarden Minthara,Regrets are of little value unless they are fuel for future victories. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Few mortals have stood against gods and monsters as we have and lived to tell the tale. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Those qualities will strengthen as she matures.
Nightwarden Minthara,You do not need to thank me for speaking the truth.
Nightwarden Minthara,It would be wise to return to him and pledge an oath of allegiance before he declares us enemies of the peace.
Nightwarden Minthara,I did not expect to meet one still sworn to Lolth who would understand me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you sense my fear, be sure that she does too. It is her greatest weapon."
Nightwarden Minthara,She had me in her clutches once before. Promise that you won't let it happen again.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Thank you. Together, we will survive her."
Nightwarden Minthara,Against Orin? I have my doubts.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We need to watch over each other, now more than ever."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am not intimidated, I am terrified. You should be too."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I doubt it. Her father is murder incarnate, and she is a devoted daughter. To please Bhaal she would butcher the world."
Nightwarden Minthara,"She has the scent of our blood, and she wil tease and toy until she tires of the hunt. Then she will obliterate us without a second thought."
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not presume to know how I feel.
Nightwarden Minthara,Her aim will be to erode our trust in one another. We cannot let that happen.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You see through my Minthara-mask, pretty little flesh-thing."
Nightwarden Minthara,A joke. I am no more Orin than you are.
Nightwarden Minthara,If she is watching - and she may well be - she will delight in seeing suspicion spread among us so quickly. We cannot let that happen.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If we kill every suspicious person in Baldur's Gate, we will have more blood on our hands than Bhaal."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Nervous? Don't be preposterous. I am on alert, as you should be too given who hunts us."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have faced Orin before, and she left scars on me that will never heal. She will enjoy adding to them, and she can strike whenever she pleases."
Nightwarden Minthara,She could be anywhere... could be anyone.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not often doubt myself, but surviving Orin took courage and strength I was not sure I had."
Nightwarden Minthara,I could not have faced her without you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are trying to raise my spirits. I appreciate it, but any joy the sight of Orin's corpse brings me is but a speck of comforting shade."
Nightwarden Minthara,There is little relief to be found from the heat of the storm we are caught in.
Nightwarden Minthara,Orin could be anywhere... could be anyone.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Correct. I am glad that you see things as I do - no matter what victory we have won, we cannot afford to relax our guard."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am not on edge, I am alert, as you should be too."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But I will never forgive him for handing me to Orin. For that, I hope Myrkul hollows out his bones, and lets them be dust."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I was like her once, when we first met, and before you ever knew me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Oh, but I am. Given what we learned of her mother, I see how similar we truly are."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A madwoman, butchering prey in the name of a god who would discard me without a thought once I was no longer of use."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Bhaal, Lolth... the Absolute. They do not have followers - they only have victims, and they reward devotion with death."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is only because of you that I did not meet the same fate as Orin. Lost to madness and blood.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you had killed me when we first met, I would have been just one more casualty of your crusade against the Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,And nobody would remember me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Given what we learned of Orin's mother, that is painfully accurate."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We were both born of trauma, both raised by parents who protected us with one hand and tormented us with the other."
Nightwarden Minthara,"That was true, once. When you first knew me, I was no different to Orin."
Nightwarden Minthara,As you wish. There is little use fretting over spilt blood.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I take no pleasure in his passing. Whatever faults he may have had, Ketheric was a great leader."
Nightwarden Minthara,Of course. He ruled Moonrise for centuries. That in itself deserves respect.
Nightwarden Minthara,Life was crueller to him than death. It is no great wonder that he found his strength in Myrkul.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I believe he was an honourable man, but the gods used him as their plaything. First, Shar and her sister, then the Three behind the Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,I sympathise.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is a sharp mind that feels sympathy for one who suffers unnecessarily, not a soft heart."
Nightwarden Minthara,I saw strength in Ketheric that had been diluted by pain.
Nightwarden Minthara,"As are we, and if the coming battle breaks us, I hope that someone will mourn our passing despite the bodies we have left in our wake."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A meaningless question. If he had killed us, and conquered the Sword Coast, I would envy him."
Nightwarden Minthara,"As it is, he lost, and I pity him."
Nightwarden Minthara,No more than you or I.
Nightwarden Minthara,"While the brain is still free, and we are still infected, we will never be safe."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But we can talk of this later. For now, let us be glad that we still draw breath. And that Orin does not."
Nightwarden Minthara,Like a dream half-realised. Our fight is not done.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hmmm. The weak and the elderly perhaps.
Nightwarden Minthara,The young would be better used as a labour force than as a source of nutrition.
Nightwarden Minthara,"That is your gift to me, and we are bound together until it is done."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps longer, if you wish it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"While Orin lives, I fear we will not last long at all, whether together or apart. We must find her, and kill her."
Nightwarden Minthara,You see a future for us once our enemies are dead? I am not so sure.
Nightwarden Minthara,I hope so too.
Nightwarden Minthara,It may become more - I hope that it does - but it may also become the cold ash that follows the flame. Or another story written in scars.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever the case, it will be a short story if Orin has her way. We must find her, and kill her."
Nightwarden Minthara,Indeed. We should make haste.
Nightwarden Minthara,Sorry. Old habits.
Nightwarden Minthara,I did not ask permission.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When we first met - before Moonrise - I intruded on your thoughts without hesitation, and took what I needed from your memories."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would not do that again unless I had reason to think you were hiding something from me. And I do not.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I did not think we would ever share anything more than an uneasy alliance, born of our mutual enmity for the Absolute.<br><br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,I was wrong. A deeper bond has grown between us.
Nightwarden Minthara,I trust you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"But I would like to touch your thoughts again, now that my mind is my own. May I?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Of course. I do not hide anything from you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Curiosity.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When the Absolute fell silent, I thought I would be alone. I expected to spend my days among surface-dwellers who knew nothing of my culture."
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not disagree. But to turn them away would be wasteful.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If they are weak, they will die, whether it is on the road or in the defence of the city. And if they are strong, they will find a way to survive."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes. And if they work hard enough for long enough, the city might allow them to earn their freedom one day."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps you think it would be better for them to starve or be slaughtered here, while the citizens hide behind their walls?"
Nightwarden Minthara,The tadpole you harvested is not a curiosity to be pickled and studied - it is a weapon that can unlock the potential of our own parasites. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you will not use it, give it to me."
Nightwarden Minthara,All I ask is that you do not waste it.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I see the change in the shimmer of your skin, and hear it in the hum of your blood. You are evolving."
Nightwarden Minthara,You absorbed a tadpole's essence to accomplish this change. Do you have more?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Free of the Absolute's influence, the tadpole is a boon. It has expanded my mind, and improved my body."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am no longer simply its host - I am its mistress.
Nightwarden Minthara,All I ask is that you do not waste them.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you ever hesitate to indulge your illithid potential, remember that I will not."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ink and paper are not as insidious as the voice of the Absolute, but they send out their commands all the same. "
Nightwarden Minthara,I did not expect you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Is that so? I suppose it explains why they allowed a tyrannical servant of Bane to take control of their city.
Nightwarden Minthara,Is that so? I suppose that is why they have allowed a tyrannical servant of Bane to take control of their city.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Truly, the citizens of Baldur's Gate are a model of shrewd wisdom that we should all hope to emulate."
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes. I am surprised the house matrons of Menzoberranzan have not discovered the power of the printing press yet.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Paper spun from spider-silk, Everdark ink drawn from dragon scales, and nefarious lies dreamt in darkness."
Nightwarden Minthara,To kill one's enemies with a well-rounded phrase... that is true power.
Nightwarden Minthara,An excellent question.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would use the Mouth to ensure the people did not trust one another. Suspicion creates doubt, and doubt creates dependency. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"And they would know that they could depend on me. Feared, venerated, adored. I would be everything to them."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I was not suggesting they be allowed to roam free. They should be put to work - the city needs labourers, and fodder to protect it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am suggesting they be fed and sheltered, and that they work in return. Call it whatever you wish."
Nightwarden Minthara,Perhaps it is why they will allow us to rule in his place when the time comes.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then we are more alike than I realised. Even though you chose this life, you will always be an exile while your heart belongs in another home."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have already returned... though there is little luxury there for me anymore, only war and madness."
Nightwarden Minthara,"One day, I may return to Menzoberranzan, as a conqueror or as a sacrifice. But my fight is elsewhere for now."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Tomorrow we return to the Underdark, and our campaign against my House continues. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Of course not. I was simply playing my part, and trying to have a little fun."
Nightwarden Minthara, Your affection is the only thing that matters.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then they are fools. You are the best of them, or I would not have chosen you."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is the only thing.
Nightwarden Minthara,Let us finish our socialising and be done.
Nightwarden Minthara,I have hosted gatherings of House Matrons and High Priestesses who wanted nothing more than to murder one another before the night was done.
Nightwarden Minthara,I have negotiated the handover of hostages and smiled politely while sensing a dagger at my back.
Nightwarden Minthara,I thought I was equal to anything. But this is all so... pleasant. And I am not even sure anyone here likes me.
Nightwarden Minthara,The great vampire lord. Tell me - where is the best feeding ground in Baldur's Gate?
Nightwarden Minthara,Hmm. I expected too much meat and wine might cause the blood to curdle like day-old milk.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I wish you well, Lord Astarion."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Just remember, if you are ever tempted to taste my blood, you may enjoy the taste, but not the toxins."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Oh, and Astarion - the next time you throw one of your infamous masquerades, I would be delighted to attend."
Nightwarden Minthara,Excellent. It will save me the effort of sneaking in under a false name. It is tiresome to masquerade before the ball even begins.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you can not recognise my qualities, you can wear Cazador's title and squat in his palace for as long as you like."
Nightwarden Minthara,You will always be a scared little spawn.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Of course. But next time, a formal invitation if you please. "
Nightwarden Minthara,I shall see you in the city.
Nightwarden Minthara,A varied diet is indeed the key to a long life.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If the inhabitants taste anything like they smell, you have peculiar taste indeed."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Tomorrow we return to Baldur's Gate, and our campaign to control the city's undesirables continues."
Nightwarden Minthara,This night shall be done sooner than any of us would like. I hope we meet again.
Nightwarden Minthara,I always have strength enough for you. Do not make me wait long.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Tomorrow we return to Avernus, and our campaign against Zariel continues."
Nightwarden Minthara,"That is troubling. Just as great tapestries begin with a single stitch, the most treacherous plots begin with a few whispered words."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I fear you are engaged in a grand game of Lanceboard, young Wyll, and you are already four moves behind."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I were causing trouble, surely your Flaming Fist would have paid me a visit in these last six months?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"In fact, when I pass them in the street, they wish me 'good day' and 'good fortune'."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not forget, young Ravengard, that I too am one of the saviours of Baldur's Gate. I stood with you when the city was on its knees."
Nightwarden Minthara,"To peace and prosperity. You will make an excellent Grand Duke, Wyll Ravengard."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If the city should fall, I will be here to raise it again. I am many things, but I am not a fool."
Nightwarden Minthara,"While Baldur's Gate is my home, I would see it stronger than its neighbours, and I will do everything in my power to make it so."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am wounded.
Nightwarden Minthara,We do not need to trust one another. Just stay out of my way.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If that day ever comes, I look forward to seeing how much the wine and good living has dulled your blade."
Nightwarden Minthara,Make sure it is the good one.
Nightwarden Minthara,"As you wish. I have business of my own to attend to, after all."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes, my love? Are you done talking to your friends? Can we leave?"
Nightwarden Minthara,I think not.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They may respect me or fear me, but I do not think they like me."
Nightwarden Minthara,What makes me so? My quick wit? My cold heart? My cutting insights?
Nightwarden Minthara,"In truth, I have never enjoyed parties... although they do present the perfect opportunity for a poisoning."
Nightwarden Minthara,You assume I am joking?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Taste my lips. They are already laced with toxins - none shall be spared tonight, not even you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now go - mingle, carouse, indulge."
Nightwarden Minthara,We will need all of our strength.
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is more to you than I recognised at first, young Ravengard."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I thought you vainglorious, and saw your adventures on the frontiers as little more than an excuse to grow your legend."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now you fight in the Hells, where there is little to be gained, and much to be lost."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And it is only your ascension to godhood that makes you so. As a mortal, you were scarcely fit to look at me."
Nightwarden Minthara,Bah.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not tell the others, or I'll burn down the first Galerian temple I see."
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is no mark you could put upon me, or proclamation you could make against me, that would make my life more hazardous than it already is."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have survived this much of my exile, but I have few friends left in this world. Or any other."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are many things, Gale. The man who became a god, the Wizard of Waterdeep... but a keeper of secrets you are not."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I expect everyone will know of my affection for you by morning, but it does not matter. Tomorrow, I will be far from here."
Nightwarden Minthara,I always thought you had a sharp mind - your misreading of me suggests otherwise.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Given where I tread, I would not survive if my heart were not as hard as my blades are sharp."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now that Karlach and I are united against Zariel's legions, Avernus burns hotter than ever."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I fear there can be no victory in the war that has chosen us, but every moment we spend together is cause for celebration."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And every foe we vanquish makes me glad to be alive, for however many days remain."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Baldur's Gate needs fresh leadership, and I am only too happy to provide. I keep to the shadows, of course, for the sake of my complexion."
Nightwarden Minthara,"With our adventures behind me, it is good to engage with the intrigue of politics again. "
Nightwarden Minthara,Even the most cunning Baldurian conspirator would struggle to survive a tenday in Menzoberranzan.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They will learn from me, or they will bow to me. "
Nightwarden Minthara,An intriguing proposition. To harness the powers of the heavens as I once harnessed you...
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will think on it, but I make no promises. "
Nightwarden Minthara,We do not know yet what calibre of god you will prove to be.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would no more allow a god to shape my destiny than I would a pigeon.
Nightwarden Minthara,Naturally. A fledgling god is of little use where my plans are concerned.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I bow to nobody, wizard, and you should not expect me to. We defeated the Absolute together. We are equals."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then we are fortunate there is nobody fitting that description here. My fortunes have only improved since the defeat of the Netherbrain.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your godhood will have a much stronger chance of staying intact if you only smite those who do not smite back.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are correct, no doubt. I have seen more terrors than wonders since we last met."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is courageous, or it is foolish, but it is certainly not self-serving."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then it is courage that drives you. And love.
Nightwarden Minthara,Better to be a fool with a purpose than an idle politician. Better to be a devil-slayer than a Duke.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Everyone in these Realms is afraid of something. Wolves, sunlight, beasts, fiends, death... loneliness."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But those who fear themselves travel the most difficult road to find their courage. You have done so, Wyll."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Well, then you are a greater fool than I thought. There is no glory in the Hells."
Nightwarden Minthara,But at least you have risen to a greater challenge than slaying goblins and bugbears.
Nightwarden Minthara,You have become a better man than you were.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will never understand why people thank one another for making honest observations.
Nightwarden Minthara,But thank you for listening.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Baldur's Gate is her home now, thanks to you, and she cannot profit from a city in decline. She will see it flourish, and she will share in its prosperity."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Not by my estimation, but you do not need to concern yourself with that."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes, Wyll. I am a paragon of virtue. I volunteer at a local orphanage, and rehabilitate wounded owlbear cubs."
Nightwarden Minthara,"All so that the children and cubs alike can be moulded to my purpose, raised in my image, and made willing to die in my name."
Nightwarden Minthara,Heh heh heh.
Nightwarden Minthara,And you have no sense of humour.
Nightwarden Minthara,Dekarios the divine graces us with his presence. I hope you do not expect me to bow or utter a prayer in your honour.
Nightwarden Minthara,The only thing more insufferable than a wizard is a god.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Better gods than you have tried.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am glad to hear that smiting is in your divine repertoire though. I feared you would be a dull kind of god.
Nightwarden Minthara,There is the wizard I remember. Finding the dreariness in divinity.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is good to see you, Gale."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are correct, but our differences are unimportant when it comes to this matter."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Neither of us can profit from a city in decline. We will see it flourish, and we will share in its prosperity."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Just as I have the best interests of Baldur's Gate at heart, so does Mizora."
Nightwarden Minthara,Of course she does.
Nightwarden Minthara,Have you?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then your adventuring days are not behind you. That is good. You are young yet, and these Realms are wide and full of wonder."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps. But do not be surprised if you hear the howl of the wolves one night, or see a sign flashing across the stars, and leave your hearth behind."
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not think your adventuring days are behind you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Tranquility will always be waiting, at the end of your journey. Wherever it takes you."
Nightwarden Minthara,Young Ravengard. My sources tell me you have returned to your former career - terrorising the Frontiers.
Nightwarden Minthara,Can you ever be sure though? How many of the monsters you kill are simply defending their way of life from those your blade protects?
Nightwarden Minthara,I doubt those you turn your blade against would agree.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The devil is a subtle creature. She will do as she always has - select victims that resemble monsters, and use your talents to dispose of them."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you are wiser than I thought. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"Well met, young Ravengard. May your blade strike true more often than not."
Nightwarden Minthara,Impressive. She has taught you to deceive yourself so adeptly that perhaps she does not need to direct you at all.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You could choose to lay down your blade, to lay down your life, to give up your soul. That you do not tells me which life matters most to you."
Nightwarden Minthara,Your own.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Well met, young Ravengard. I do not think our paths shall cross again."
Nightwarden Minthara,I did not expect you of all people to be a devil's lapdog for the rest of your days.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am sure that being slain by a heroic blade is of great comfort to your victims.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have been both victim and monster. Whichever you saw me as, if your turned your blade on me, there are still those who would grieve my passing."
Nightwarden Minthara,And I would bleed like any other.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I was taught that any man who spoke out of line, or above his lowly station, should be punished. I called that justice."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not think there is such a thing as justice anymore, and I do not find my comfort at either end of a blade."
Nightwarden Minthara,Any who survive the torments of the gods deserve peace. Most never find it.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Shar inflicted such misery on you. Most would find it unbearable, but you have shown resilience."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Fresh from the farm, Jenevelle? It is good to see you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will have a palace soon enough, and when I do, I shall make you my jester."
Nightwarden Minthara,Why not leave?
Nightwarden Minthara,"A word of advice? If there are those who would be hurt by your departure, do not slip away without saying goodbye."
Nightwarden Minthara,They may be willing to follow and leave their world for you.
Nightwarden Minthara,And if not... good riddance.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Which sewer did you crawl out of to join us here today, spawn?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Hmph. I am surprised you have survived there so long. Your face shines like a sickly beacon even in this light.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Oh, but I wish I could see it. You must spend your nights cursing your cowardice, and wondering what might have been."
Nightwarden Minthara,Cazador really did teach you to ignore the stars in favour of your gutter.
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes - my life is rich. A night without an assassin is a dull night indeed. 
Nightwarden Minthara,I think we're done here.
Nightwarden Minthara,"In this world, the two roles go hand in hand more often than not."
Nightwarden Minthara,Dawn will be breaking soon. I need to guard my complexion... you need to guard your life.
Nightwarden Minthara,Cazador sends his regards.
Nightwarden Minthara,Ha - of course not. I am teasing you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Then it would fit well with that ludicrous hairstyle you're so fond of.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ha. Do not do anything that you would regret - I am, how do you say, pulling your limb."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I ever meet that ancient fop, Cazador, I will reduce him to dust."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I do you that service, I will expect something in return."
Nightwarden Minthara,Where else but the Hells?
Nightwarden Minthara,"The city, of course. The site of our triumph."
Nightwarden Minthara,My homecoming has begun.
Nightwarden Minthara,Grotesque.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Oh, but one more thing."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When we first met, I could not have chosen that future. I could choose nothing. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Call yourself a slayer of monsters and be proud, for that is what you are."
Nightwarden Minthara,I have seen you without a smile. It is a poor sight indeed.
Nightwarden Minthara,Exquisite.
Nightwarden Minthara,Wizard.
Nightwarden Minthara,Human.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your tressym is called Tara and she dislikes your beard. She is wrong - it is a fine beard. Dashing, even. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"You enjoy travel and adventure, but miss Waterdeep whenever you are away. This is because your mind is restless, and can only find peace in familiar places."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your ambition is not cruel, but you fear that if you indulge it, you will lose yourself in the mysteries of the Weave and unravel the world."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are afraid of so many things, and it is that fear that keeps you true to yourself."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I know a great deal about you, Gale Dekarios. And that is precisely why I know how enjoyable it is to tease and befuddle you."
Nightwarden Minthara,And you're still the same charming blend of pompous and naive. It is good that there are some constants in these maddening Realms.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not tell the others, or I'll clip your pussycat's wings."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are many things Gale: the Wizard of Waterdeep, a man who has touched divinity, and the owner of a rather dashing beard."
Nightwarden Minthara,But a keeper of secrets you are not.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not tell the others, or I'll set fire to your library."
Nightwarden Minthara,Hmph.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Is that the smell of brimstone I detect, young Ravengard?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Of course. And to ensure I do not break protocol... should I refer to the lady Mizora as your Grand Duchess?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Of course. The city's prodigal son, returned as a saviour, and yoked to a devil - it is such a perfect satire, who could help but laugh?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Oh, but I have upset you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Baldur's Gate doesn't have an aristocracy. Your Council of Four is a rogues gallery of merchants, politicians and adventurers."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And then of course there's your lady Mizora, to make a Council of Five."
Nightwarden Minthara,Poor Wyll. What does the devil ask of you?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Of course. On this occasion, you need not even earn it, my sweet."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We will spend the rest of our lives together. Go, be with the others."
Nightwarden Minthara,We - and they - need not adjust. We need only endure until we can claim the position we deserve.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We undid the Grand Design, and saved Baldur's Gate from annihilation."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am still establishing a foothold in Baldur's Gate, but soon I will have strength enough to aid you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When that is the case, I will gladly come to Avernus to fight by your side once again."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have a war of my own to fight, against my mother and her people, and there is every chance I will not survive it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But if I do, I will gladly bring my strength to Avernus to fight by your side again."
Nightwarden Minthara,You are most welcome.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If the tadpoles still allowed us to share ourselves, I could show you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even then, you may not understand. As it is, you never will, because there are no words in my language or yours to explain such mysteries of the heart."
Nightwarden Minthara,Helping an ally is its own reward. But I can think of few greater challenges than battling across the Hells.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Besides, what else would you have me do? Lay down my weapons and spend my last centuries growing plump? I think not."
Nightwarden Minthara,You must.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am glad to see you, Karlach. Your heart can survive the Hells, but I feared your spirit would not."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have no doubt, but you need not fight alone."
Nightwarden Minthara,How is the view from the Upper City?
Nightwarden Minthara,How could it not with you to guide the reconstruction?
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is not only dukes and partriars who are doing their part though. I am helping too, in my own way."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Given your position, there are certain things that must go unsaid, but let us just say I do what you cannot to keep the city strong."
Nightwarden Minthara,"By toxin, blade or word, I weed out the weak and the untrustworthy. You may not like my methods, but our goals align."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not have a 'spot', I have a network. Our eyes see a city that needs help from the top and the bottom."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We can help, but we need your people to stay out of our way."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is good to see you, Jenevelle. How do your parents fare?"
Nightwarden Minthara,To endure the agonies Shar inflicted on them for so long shows resilience. They deserve peace.
Nightwarden Minthara,What is 'normal'? You and I were born to do extraordinary things - we have challenged the gods and live to tell of it.
Nightwarden Minthara,Young Ravengard. An honour as always.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am glad you recognised the benefits of that approach. If he proves troublesome, we can always kill him later, when his guard is down."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Listen, worm."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even as the elder brain tears at the foundations of the city, he stands strong, and looks for solutions."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would have thought this entire conspiracy of gods and monsters to be impossible if I had not seen it for myself.
Nightwarden Minthara,But Baldur's Gate is a mere bauble. We have the chance to seize something much greater. Surely you see it?
Nightwarden Minthara,"What I propose is nigh on impossible, but if anyone can succeed, it is us. We have the Prism, and we have the courage to slay gods."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you misunderstand me. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"I expected you would be, but know this..."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is as if you read my mind. Perhaps you did.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will find her, I will murder her. And I will smile."
Nightwarden Minthara,"There was no god. Orin held me down in a cocoon of flesh, while a mind flayer forced a parasite into my brain. And she laughed at my fear."
Nightwarden Minthara,Now I know that those memories are lies.
Nightwarden Minthara,"She is the one who brought me to Moonrise, and into the presence of her so-called god - the Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If there is a way to turn this design toward slaughter rather than control, she will take it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"She is fierce, vicious, and cruel. In those respects, we are alike - but she is dangerously unpredictable. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"And for that I am sorry. I will commit all future atrocities for my own gain - and yours, should we stand together."
Nightwarden Minthara,Orin was by my side. She told me that god had chosen me to be a True Soul. Blessed and adored.
Nightwarden Minthara,It was more of an idea than an entity. Pure love. Total power.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We may fail, but we must try."
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I first visited Moonrise, I stood before the Absolute in awe. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Patience. If we do not prepare, Baldur's Gate will be our tomb."
Nightwarden Minthara,"First we take the Netherstones, then the brain, then the world."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Those who kill without motive cannot be trusted. I would not like to wake with your knife at my throat, and never understand the reason why."
Nightwarden Minthara,That troubles me. 
Nightwarden Minthara,I am satisfied.
Nightwarden Minthara,"A wise ploy, and it was successful, to an extent. We did not find a cure, but we found our purpose."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I jest, but it is as good a reason as any. I have done much more foolish things to win the respect of far inferior people."
Nightwarden Minthara,I'm flattered. Will you be bringing dead rats and birds to my tent now that we share a camp?
Nightwarden Minthara,So I ask again - why kill the inhabitants of the Grove?
Nightwarden Minthara,"I don't care about them, I care about you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is yet one thing about you that troubles me, though. Something I need you to explain."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We are bound, then, to travel together, even if we do not yet agree on our ultimate purpose."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are not stupid. When we reach Baldur's Gate and face the other Chosen, you will see that my way is the right one."
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is violence in your future regardless. With me, you can at least be sure the violence will lead to glory."
Nightwarden Minthara,Nothing worthwhile ever came without loss. But together we have the strength to decide who loses. And to make sure it is not us.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We have a purpose and a bond. By my oath, I will fight with you while that purpose holds."
Nightwarden Minthara,And then we will need no gods. We will be their equal. We will be Absolute.
Nightwarden Minthara,"But if we are wise, it will be our dominion."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies."
Nightwarden Minthara,"He favours her, and she is one of the founders of this insane cult."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would prefer to put my faith in your strength than the favour of your god. After all, it is Orin and this grand deception that he chose - not you."
Nightwarden Minthara,You killed the dead man. I'm impressed.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hmph. It is better to kill for it.
Nightwarden Minthara,These Harpers of yours. Would they die for you?
Nightwarden Minthara,"An exile from Lolth, much like myself. There is no love for her in the Underdark."
Nightwarden Minthara,This place has been used to make slaves of those who should be masters.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever experiments Balthazar performed here, I fear he made more than thralls and ghouls."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A splendid device. All the benefits of a cleric, no gods required."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Fresh recruits for Ketheric's army. To a necromancer, a morgue is a muster yard."
Nightwarden Minthara,Some who worked here were not thralls or undead. They were loyal to Ketheric and his grim cause.
Nightwarden Minthara,The elder brain uses the infected like puppets. Such tremendous power.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is good to meet somebody who recognises our talents - better still if they reward us for doing what comes naturally. 
Nightwarden Minthara,You are wasting my time.
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't let down your guard.
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. Continue your patrol.
Nightwarden Minthara,Get ready. We'll leave before they can flee.
Nightwarden Minthara,And now your path takes you to Baldur's Gate. I shall walk that path with you.
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not have a home there anymore - my own siblings would slay me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I go where my enemies are, and they are not here in the shadows. They are in Baldur's Gate."
Nightwarden Minthara,And they will pose a greater threat than Ketheric.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If the gods stand in our way, we will tear them down. Nothing will deny me my vengeance on Orin."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You make it sound so simple. She is the Chosen of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, and one of the cult's founders."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Jealous? You needn't be -  when Orin is in my hands, her agony will nourish me. "
Nightwarden Minthara,To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"We must be free if we are to rule - and to be free, we must destroy this cult, and Ketheric's co-conspirators along with it. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"During my time in the cult, I came to know one of his co-conspirators all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps in time, I can help direct your violence. Until then, I will watch my back."
Nightwarden Minthara,Power always has. But I shall not get too comfortable here. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is clear, now, that he was not working alone."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But I will satisfy my war-lust soon, for there are greater challenges than Ketheric ahead of us."
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes - although I wish we had collaborated on the killing itself. 
Nightwarden Minthara,My blood ran hot when we broke Ketheric's bones together. But we have greater challenges ahead of us.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will never tire of sitting on dead men's thrones.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Feisty little creature. If you hold it down, I will slice off its trunk."
Nightwarden Minthara,We should not tarry in this charnel house long.
Nightwarden Minthara,Indeed. And now we know that he was not acting alone.
Nightwarden Minthara,Finally.
Nightwarden Minthara,Now. I am ready to leave this damned place whenever you give the word. The city awaits.
Nightwarden Minthara,"But you had the Prism, did you not? So the Absolute was not the cause."
Nightwarden Minthara,"They are put to death, obviously."
Nightwarden Minthara,The goblins! They failed me. They failed us all.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Mine! It's - it's my fault. I failed you, my lord. Please, forgive me."
Nightwarden Minthara,Of course it is not the General's fault -
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes - no!
Nightwarden Minthara,If I had been given drow warriors instead of goblin trash -
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will not be slandered! General, you saw my reports - you know it's not my fault."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Shipments of parasites, bound for Baldur's Gate. Half the city may be infected already."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Converts, pilgrims, mercenaries. They all seek power, but will find only death."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will never serve the Absolute again, Z'rell, and I will take your prattling tongue as a reminder of this moment."
Nightwarden Minthara,"There will be no retribution, Z'rell. Only vengeance - and that shall be mine."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The Absolute's regard is poison, Z'rell."
Nightwarden Minthara,We should infiltrate the devil's home. I have always dreamed of visiting the hells. 
Nightwarden Minthara, Baldur's Gate awaits. 
Nightwarden Minthara," Ketheric is defeated, but his army marches on. To rid ourselves of this parasite, we will have to give chase. "
Nightwarden Minthara,NO!
Nightwarden Minthara,Murdering Orin... raising my daughter...
Nightwarden Minthara,"No. Please, mercy! Please!"
Nightwarden Minthara,"I await your judgement, General."
Nightwarden Minthara,Minthara Baenre.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Queen of Spiders, I beseech of you the strength to destroy my foes."
Nightwarden Minthara,We must leave quickly - I cannot hold my fury for long.
Nightwarden Minthara,Their death is merely delayed - we will return and kill them all.
Nightwarden Minthara,You really do have a way with words.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hmph. I would have preferred to bleed them.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Break them, before they call for help."
Nightwarden Minthara,Let us free them of their god - and of their lives.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You should have let me pass - now, you'll die."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You dared scar my mind, I will gut you."
Nightwarden Minthara,Security is tight here. Z'rell made this library her command post. 
Nightwarden Minthara,This is where the great General Thorm rests his bones? We should ransack it.
Nightwarden Minthara,This chamber is unlike the others here - it does not reek of death.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hold your tongues in General Thorm's presence.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Allow me to explain, General."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I - yes! It's the goblins' fault. They failed you, General, not me."
Nightwarden Minthara,The commander I was... not the slave... I became...
Nightwarden Minthara,Menzoberranzan...
Nightwarden Minthara,To find a home... for myself... and my child...
Nightwarden Minthara,"Why come to Moonrise, where the cult's power is strongest? Why not walk away?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"No god commands me now. But out of respect for what you have done for me, for my salvation, I shall follow you whatever your beliefs."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You describe me well, but you deceive nonetheless. You chose to spare me, I am sure of it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do have one more question though, before we continue."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I should not lose myself in these thoughts of what might have been. I live, and I am grateful."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If Ketheric had ordered me to slay you to prove my worth, I would have. Or died trying."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Sparing an enemy's life is a great risk. Even though I owe my life to the part of you that showed me mercy, it concerns me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"So might any other True Soul, and yet Gut and Ragzlin do not stand with us, under your protection."
Nightwarden Minthara,You chose to incapacitate me rather than killing me when you eradicated my minions. Why?
Nightwarden Minthara,"We can travel together, but there can be no trust between us."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you are no different than I once was.
Nightwarden Minthara,"That will do. For now. We should speak more of whatever afflicts you, but there will be time for that."
Nightwarden Minthara,I like the deliberate nature of the lie even less than the disorder of your actions.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Good. Whatever afflicted you, we can leave it in the past, like the corpses in the Grove."
Nightwarden Minthara,Are you in control of your actions now?
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. That is as it should be.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Drought, famine and warfare are threats to the world as well. Do you intend to eradicate them?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"True. But do not lose yourself to despair and fatalism. They tried to make victims of us, but we can take this opportunity to become gods."
Nightwarden Minthara,The elder brain is the only thing that has ever managed to change my mind. You're welcome to try.
Nightwarden Minthara,For the Absolute's lie...
Nightwarden Minthara,Destined to be... matron mother... House Baenre...
Nightwarden Minthara,We should not linger here. The cult's army is on the march.
Nightwarden Minthara,You survived. Good.
Nightwarden Minthara,We must talk of the horrors you saw below.
Nightwarden Minthara,Is Ketheric truly slain?
Nightwarden Minthara,The Harper may know more - her precious Baldur's Gate was the soil that nourished his growth.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Me too, but I am keen to find joy in the consequences of the killing as well as in the act itself."
Nightwarden Minthara,That he has enslaved illithids to fulfil his ambitions strongly suggests he is the latter.
Nightwarden Minthara,And we have the chance to seize the greatest advantage of all. Surely you see it?
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is no limit to my ambitions. I will enjoy killing Orin, but unlike her, I do not kill for pleasure alone. I kill to gain advantage."
Nightwarden Minthara,"In the long history of these Realms, few people have attempted anything so bold."
Nightwarden Minthara,Madness would be to let the Absolute's potential go to waste.
Nightwarden Minthara,Fine. All I ask of you is that you keep an open mind.
Nightwarden Minthara,My time will come. With or without you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Without you - without the Prism - I cannot risk going to the city. The Absolute would take my mind again.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Only that he serves Bane, which could make him a petty lordling, or a despot capable of bending the world to his will."
Nightwarden Minthara,Break his bones instead. Start with the fingers.
Nightwarden Minthara,Tell them to stop cutting him - we need him alive.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The child Shadowheart can be irritating and naive, but what do you hope to gain by handing her to DeVir?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Your thoughts are veiled. Are you protecting these creatures because they share your blood? 
Nightwarden Minthara,Your thoughts are... veiled? Why do you protect these devilkin?
Nightwarden Minthara,I see only fragments. Your mind is confused - do what you must to clear it.
Nightwarden Minthara,Fine. I will share what I have. But keep it to yourself; the goblins would squander it.
Nightwarden Minthara,For the Absolute.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will gather my warband and reach the grove by next light.
Nightwarden Minthara,What greater reward could there be?
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes. I suppose I might offer you passage. But first you will raze the grove and honour our mistress.
Nightwarden Minthara,"And when they are dead, the Absolute will reward your faith. As will I."
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute brought you here for a reason - to throw open those gates so we can crush our enemies.
Nightwarden Minthara,Control yourself - you are as uncouth as the goblins. The slaughter at the Grove will not begin until you have prepared the way.
Nightwarden Minthara,We will cleanse the place of infidels and burn it to the ground in the Absolute's name.
Nightwarden Minthara,You will open the gates from the inside when the time is right to strike.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will gather a raiding party and move into position.
Nightwarden Minthara,Exquisite. The Absolute chose well when She chose you.
Nightwarden Minthara,You defy me... You defy the Absolute! Traitor!
Nightwarden Minthara,A drowning creature will cling to a blade if nothing else is offered. Be that blade.
Nightwarden Minthara,That is hard to believe - your mind is a maze of misdirection. 
Nightwarden Minthara,No. There is intent behind this deception - and you will pay for it with your life.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now - let us hunt together, sister. In Her name."
Nightwarden Minthara,Why do you ask? Surely you feel the Absolute moving through me - just as I feel Her in you. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Join my hunt.
Nightwarden Minthara,"This tribe is mine to command. If you have business here, then you report to me."
Nightwarden Minthara,The thief whimpering in our dungeon tried to flee to their sanctuary.
Nightwarden Minthara,Worshippers of a false god. Their existence is an insult to the Absolute's claim on this region.
Nightwarden Minthara,You need to prove your value before I give you anything. Join my hunt - that will show your worth.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Take it - I do not need a guide, I need a hunter. Will you join me?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Destroying it will demonstrate our power. Soon, all false gods will cower before the Absolute. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would expect nothing less. Together, we shall burn it to the ground."
Nightwarden Minthara,You are sure? Show it to me. Be my eyes.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Speak, True Soul. The hunt must begin soon."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Praise be. And now, through Her will, you can be my eyes."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your allegiance should be to me and the Absolute. While you hold on to your past, you are worthless."
Nightwarden Minthara,Assist the goblins with their interrogation - the prisoner can tell us what you cannot.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Purge yourself of these intoxicants, and come back to me when you are capable of serving as you should."
Nightwarden Minthara,They're half-devil refugees... Nobody wants them.
Nightwarden Minthara,Go to their refuge and make your way inside. As a friend.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If the inhabitants do not realise you are the knife at their throats, we can use that against them."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The last I sent did not return. Dead at the hands of those they seek, no doubt. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes, sister. Together, we shall burn it to the ground."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Enough. Speak only to me, True Soul. The hunt must begin."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I intend to find it, and destroy it."
Nightwarden Minthara,The druid makes his home in a nearby sanctuary where his followers worship a false god.
Nightwarden Minthara,Here are your new orders.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you were sent here to hunt him, perhaps you can help me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have not seen this druid, but he harbours worshippers of a false god in a hidden grove nearby."
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is no power except for the Absolute. If you are sick, speak to the goblins' priestess - she, too, is a True Soul."
Nightwarden Minthara,Show me the grove. Be my eyes.
Nightwarden Minthara,"My patience wears thin, True Soul. The hunt must begin."
Nightwarden Minthara,"There is a weapon the Absolute seeks - I'm sure those wretches have it hidden away there. We will find it, amongst the dead and the ashes."
Nightwarden Minthara,Interesting. What do you know of this druid?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Prove yourself worthy, and you will have what you seek."
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes. I suppose I might offer passage. But first - we hunt.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would take greater pleasure in killing them myself than in sending them to die in the woods. 
Nightwarden Minthara,One. We captured a human who knows exactly where it is. 
Nightwarden Minthara,He's been resilient but he'll talk...
Nightwarden Minthara,Enough. Speak only to me while you are in my presence. The hunt must begin soon.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I see the slaughter has already begun. We will eliminate those who remain together, True Soul."
Nightwarden Minthara,The druids have called on their god to protect the place. No matter.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Faith is stronger than blood, traitor!"
Nightwarden Minthara,I would sacrifice a thousand drow if the Absolute commanded it! You will be the first!
Nightwarden Minthara,Your connection to the Absolute is strong... but do not think it will protect you if you cross me. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"If that is true, killing you will prove my superiority."
Nightwarden Minthara,Destroying this place is the Absolute's will. Would you defy Her?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now, you must hunt with me. In Her name."
Nightwarden Minthara,Excellent. Now show it to me! Be my eyes...
Nightwarden Minthara,"We will have to do this the hard way. Scour the area and hunt them down, then report back to me."
Nightwarden Minthara,So close! Their fate is sealed - and you will be instrumental in the slaughter.
Nightwarden Minthara,Tell me what you know. The Absolute will reward us with such power if we find this place.
Nightwarden Minthara,Excellent - be sure not to kill him before he talks.
Nightwarden Minthara,And you believe their god's roots and branches can stand against the Absolute's fury?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Together, we will slaughter any who remain."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you played a part in thinning their numbers, I commend your efforts."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are a poor liar. I do not know why you are protecting them, and I do not care."
Nightwarden Minthara,"They are servants of the Absolute. In sufficient numbers, they are an effective force. Expendable and willing."
Nightwarden Minthara,But they do not have the wits to lead this hunt with me. Do you?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Praise be. A True Soul. Are you here to join the hunt, sister?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Get her out of my sight.
Nightwarden Minthara,Throw this snivelling wretch in the pit.
Nightwarden Minthara,Tear them apart!
Nightwarden Minthara,The rest of you - charge!
Nightwarden Minthara,"Join the battle, and kill them all!"
Nightwarden Minthara,Bring me their heads!
Nightwarden Minthara,To the gate! Kill them all!
Nightwarden Minthara,In the name of the Absolute! Kill them all!
Nightwarden Minthara,Finish them!
Nightwarden Minthara,"Gortash will be delighted to hear of Orin's death, but be ready for anything when we report to him. If he is to betray us, that would be the time."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Did you help to construct this metal monstrosity, gnome? Help us disable it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your goddess awaits. Hear her out, but remember that you do not owe her obedience, and you certainly do not owe her your life."
Nightwarden Minthara,Surrendering a powerful ally to this preening wizard does not seem wise.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We should kill this petulant wizard on our own terms, and allow Nightsong the pleasure of taking his head. Do not provoke him."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have little affection for Nightsong, but I would have less for you if you gave her up without a fight."
Nightwarden Minthara,"No prisoners, no mercy!"
Nightwarden Minthara,We strike for the Absolute!
Nightwarden Minthara,Gather the raiders. It is time.
Nightwarden Minthara,Come. We have found our prey.
Nightwarden Minthara,These Sharrans erase the personality of all those who threaten them. Just another miserable cult.
Nightwarden Minthara,And the prisoner?
Nightwarden Minthara,Interesting. I wasn't expecting guests.
Nightwarden Minthara,These pariahs - they're prepared to fight for the Absolute?
Nightwarden Minthara,How many raiders do we have?
Nightwarden Minthara,"I wish there were time to celebrate her death, but one Chosen still stands. Gortash is our next target."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your life, much like your words, is meaningless, whelp. End the latter to save the former.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Relinquishing the stone to him makes us servants, not allies. We should keep what we have earned."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You have already failed me once, and now you dare question me?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"If he doesn't, I'll cut out his tongue."
Nightwarden Minthara,It's not our concern. Our prey are elsewhere.
Nightwarden Minthara,The village to the east - it's abandoned?
Nightwarden Minthara,"You follow my lead on this raid, creatures!"
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you fail me, the spiders will feed on your bones!"
Nightwarden Minthara,We will strike in the name of the Absolute!
Nightwarden Minthara,Join me. The Absolute demands blood.
Nightwarden Minthara,The prisoner can keep his tongue - it's Spike's I'll be removing.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is no god.
Nightwarden Minthara,This promises to be an amusing spectacle. Let us see if death can silence Volo at last.
Nightwarden Minthara,"What a darling child we have raised. We helped it to live, and it helped itself to this family's brains. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Until their sanctuary is found, I will take something precious from you every hour that passes. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your scouting party has not returned, and half of the intruders escaped your guards."
Nightwarden Minthara,Did he tell you where his friends are hiding before he fled?
Nightwarden Minthara,I trust you have found the sanctuary? I hunger for battle.
Nightwarden Minthara,It was a beautiful webbing.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Just give the word, and I will kill the clown. We would be praised as heroes."
Nightwarden Minthara,I have been expecting you. The goblins tell me that you forced a confession from our prisoner.
Nightwarden Minthara,You serve the Absolute well.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are a True Soul? Little wonder that you serve me so well.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is time for the raid to begin. The grove, and those who are hiding there, will fall."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are a True Soul, sister? It is good to have your assistance."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Without your help, they would have extracted nothing but screams and blood."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The goblins tell me that you extracted a confession from our prisoner, True Soul."
Nightwarden Minthara,A True Soul? Praise be. Are you here to join my hunt?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Praise be. A True Soul. Are you here to join the hunt, brother?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Silence now, creature. Or I will silence you forever."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not have time for interruptions, sister."
Nightwarden Minthara,Report. And make it quick - organising these creatures tests my patience.
Nightwarden Minthara,...Minthara... adept... House Baenre...
Nightwarden Minthara,Better for us to be a solution rather than a problem for his Steel Watch to scrape off the street.
Nightwarden Minthara,To you? Doubtful.
Nightwarden Minthara,Let the cards fall. We have a strong hand to play.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Be grateful I no longer follow the Spider Queen's teachings. If I did, you would be the first to fall into my web."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You have never tried it, I assume."
Nightwarden Minthara,It takes less work than you devote to maintaining your foppish facade. And it's far more rewarding.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Stop gawking at the decor, spawn. This place is dangerous."
Nightwarden Minthara,"This promises to be an amusing spectacle, and the accused is guilty of offending my ears at the very least."
Nightwarden Minthara,Would you not prefer basking in the sun like a lizard now that it no longer blisters your pretty skin?
Nightwarden Minthara,... Moonrise Towers...
Nightwarden Minthara,... god... everything... the future...
Nightwarden Minthara,East... village... well...
Nightwarden Minthara,... raiding... hunting... the Absolute's will...
Nightwarden Minthara,... Underdark... Menzoberranzan...
Nightwarden Minthara,... by my side...
Nightwarden Minthara,... murdered... infidel... traitor...
Nightwarden Minthara,Drider... lantern...
Nightwarden Minthara,Any orders?
Nightwarden Minthara,If the Absolute wills it.
Nightwarden Minthara,Whatever you wish. I live to serve.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We can put the Gondians back to work, rebuild the Steel Watch, and march on the Underdark with an unstoppable army at our back, and a song of conquest on our lips. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes, that would be good. I'm sure my mother has missed me - she likes competition. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps they still can be. Gratitude is an easy thing to exploit, and Baldur's Gate owes its continued existence to us."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We reclaimed our freedom, though everything was against us. What would you do with it?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"No more gods or monsters, no devils or demons to manipulate our fate."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Yes, I would like that."
Nightwarden Minthara,Perhaps now we can make our own destiny.
Nightwarden Minthara,"No higher power can command or restrain us - we will assemble an army of thralls, and who then will be able to stand against us?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"In time, you will learn to master your form, and then you will be perfection."
Nightwarden Minthara,Why would I ever leave? 
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your mind may be too powerful a thing for me to change, but I shall try."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Stay with me one more day. Let me see all that you are, and I will show you what I believe we can be."
Nightwarden Minthara,You do not ever need to be alone.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The battle would be legendary, and our kingdom would be magnificent."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Perhaps it is time for my homecoming. An exile from Lolth and her mind flayer consort, leading a conquering horde on Menzoberranzan."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It will be a glorious homecoming, and you will make a beautiful queen."
Nightwarden Minthara,I can think of one place that would be a natural home for us both.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It will be a glorious homecoming, and you will make a beautiful king.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would have preferred to claim the whole world when we had the chance, but Baldur's Gate is not a bad place to start."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Come, my darling. We have a realm to conquer."
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not presume you know what I do and don't deserve. I have chosen you - and I will have what is mine.
Nightwarden Minthara,We will make Zariel sorry she ever laid eyes on you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will not let that happen. I hoped we might be able to enjoy the spoils of the city, but we must return to Avernus at once."
Nightwarden Minthara,I know what is happening. The engine is failing. You are dying.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You have endured so much, Karlach, and survived it all. You need not endure this pain in silence."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The engine can endure in Avernus - we can return there, together, and make Zariel regret ever laying eyes on you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"No, Karlach. I will not lose you - not today."
Nightwarden Minthara,"As do I. But smile, my love, there are yet more worlds to conquer. Perhaps it is time for my homecoming."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Chult, Thay, Amn, Waterdeep... there is a world of wonders to discover, and boundless Realms to conquer."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A shame to go to all the effort of saving the city if we do not seize it, but rebuilding will be a formidable task."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But we can look to the future tomorrow... or the day after. Today, let us think only of ourselves in this moment. We have won a lifetime together."
Nightwarden Minthara,"My name belongs to my mother, so our House will have a new name - your name - and the world will learn to fear it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The Sword Coast will be our battlefield, and Baldur's Gate will be the founding city of a new dynasty."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We can put the Gondians back to work, rebuild the Steel Watch, and march to Waterdeep with an unstoppable army at our back, and a song of conquest on our lips."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It will be a glorious homecoming, and you will make a beautiful monarch, ruling by my side."
Nightwarden Minthara,"So am I, my love. Let us be monsters together."
Nightwarden Minthara,You are infinite.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now, I mourn the loss of the tadpole, because I can only imagine the wonders it could show me if our minds locked together as they once did."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Why leave? Baldur's Gate will be desperate for new leadership, and who better than us to lend our assistance."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Why bother? Let Baldur's Gate wear its scars proudly, until the next crisis wipes it from the world entirely."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If Baldur's Gate is too foolish to recognise its saviours, so be it. The city will miss your influence, as will I."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is a sobering thought, and I intend to chase it away with whatever filth passes for wine in these parts."
Nightwarden Minthara,"So many have fallen, on both sides of this conflict. Once, I would have died proudly in defence of the Netherbrain, thinking it a god."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are beginning to blister, spawn. Best scurry back to the shadows."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I almost envy him. While he retreats into shadow, I prepare for my long exile on the surface."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I agree. We should claim whatever's left of the Elfsong as spoils, and drink it dry. By rights, half the city belongs to us.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"It calls to me too, but I can never return. I have executed enough heretics in my time to know what horrors await an exile from Lolth."
Nightwarden Minthara,I fear you must. These people are too short-sighted to recognise a saviour in an unfamiliar form.
Nightwarden Minthara,"As you should, you have earned the right. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"As long as you have no designs on my mind, I do not much care what your intentions are."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We should claim whatever's left of the Elfsong as spoils, and drink it dry. We will raise the first glass to our memories of Gale."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Are we prepared for Raphael's fury? We will survive the hells through strategy, not strength."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I cannot love who I do not trust, with either my heart or my body. I am fortunate to have found someone worthy."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I had hoped we would not part so quickly. I have no home, and few friends remaining in this world."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It flourishes because the strong feed on the weak. Charming as you are, child, you would be nourishment for the matrons mothers."
Nightwarden Minthara,"This is the moment, my love. The moment in which we make a new world for ourselves."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are glorious, my love. You have never been more beautiful."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your body is gone, but your mind is more beautiful than ever. Before, I could hold all that you are in my thoughts."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But despite everything we gave up when we destroyed the brain, it is good to be here with you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Not as conquerors, but as saviours."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The world wakes to a new dawn, and we are here to greet it."
Nightwarden Minthara, Wait is that Tav?<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"Karlach, no. If we had taken control, if we had become Absolute, I could have saved you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If this is your end, face it with the courage you have shown in your life, Karlach."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever you cannot bear, I can take from you."
Nightwarden Minthara,Is there no end to these horrors?
Nightwarden Minthara,"If we must butcher our dreams, so be it.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Are you afraid, wizard? There is no shame in it when faced with madness such as this."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And what if your nerve fails at the last, wizard? I would rather trust my courage than yours.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"The moment our victory is not assured, do not hesitate. Destroy the brain, whatever the cost - even if it is our lives."
Nightwarden Minthara,Appalling. I am glad my memories of the infection are not so clear.
Nightwarden Minthara,We are giving the orders now - command it to obey! Seize control!
Nightwarden Minthara,It is afraid - good. Show no mercy.
Nightwarden Minthara,"That is our target. Focus the power of the Netherstones on the crown, and we may yet triumph!"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Zariel is the last of your tormentors who lives. I will find her and punish her, whether you follow me or not. "
Nightwarden Minthara,Would you have me navigate the hells without a guide? 
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. We have faced so much together already - it is only right we test ourselves against an archdevil and her legions.
Nightwarden Minthara,Together we can have our vengeance on those who infected us.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Rest well, and keep your wits about you. Tomorrow, we go to war with the cult of the Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,General Thorm would have the world believe that his invulnerability is a gift from the Absolute.
Nightwarden Minthara,"That is a lie, intended to impress those who flock to the cult's cause, and to strike fear in the minds of those who stand against the Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I believe Thorm draws his power not from a divine source, but an arcane one."
Nightwarden Minthara,I suspect it is the very relic that Balthazar has been sent to retrieve.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We must find the necromancer, and claim what he seeks. Or destroy it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now, rest. We will need our strength for what lies ahead."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Moonrise is a den of necromancy, and the most powerful practitioner of the art is Thorm's closest advisor, Balthazar."
Nightwarden Minthara,"He has chambers beside the General's, on the upper floor of the tower. I suspect we will find answers there."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I intend to cause plenty, but only for our enemies."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not sleep unless I wish to. Until I feel safe among this company, I shall spend my nights planning for the fights to come."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not require sleep, but I shall use the solitude of the night to plan for the fights to come."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would gladly join you in the fight. Leave one of your other allies here, and I shall."
Nightwarden Minthara,"For now, we will travel together, and fight together. In time, perhaps we will lie together again."
Nightwarden Minthara,Kind words do not always come easily to me... 
Nightwarden Minthara,"When we lay together, I was myself for the first time since they butchered my mind."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I knew you were different to other True Souls when we lay together. Now I know it was the Prism that silenced the Absolute in those moments, not you."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would rather share my camp with goblins again.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am ready to join you in battle, if you have space in your ranks."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then make room. None among your allies can compare to me.
Nightwarden Minthara,As you wish.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It does not compare with the comforts of home, but your camp is almost palatial in comparison to my previous accommodation."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Thank you. For allowing me to come here, and for bringing me back to myself."
Nightwarden Minthara,Each memory that returns to me is more disturbing than the last. The things that I did in the name of the Absolute... the things that were done to me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It does not need to be. But if you prefer to focus on the fight, I will not distract you."
Nightwarden Minthara,They broke my mind.
Nightwarden Minthara,"While our tadpoles live, and the cult have the means to control them, we will never be safe."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We must eradicate them, starting with General Thorm... I mean Ketheric. My deference to him is a habit that will die hard, I fear."
Nightwarden Minthara,"All that live can die. I can help you plot Ketheric's demise, but I need something from you first."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Not only this battle, but all that come after."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is the safest place to be.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Swear that you will keep me close... until the Absolute is dead, at least. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"The Prism will protect me. You will fight alongside me, and help me to get my vengeance."
Nightwarden Minthara,Precisely.
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not fall for my foes. I vanquish them.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I knew you were different to other True Souls when we met, but I could see nothing clearly."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you should have killed me rather than saving me.
Nightwarden Minthara,This is an incubus. It will steal your soul. You may need it later.
Nightwarden Minthara,I want to go where you go.
Nightwarden Minthara,"After all that we have done together, you would leave me now?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"The people we saved will not thank us. They will hunt us, and kill us."
Nightwarden Minthara,You even more than I.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I thought your mind had evolved, not degraded. Do you not see? No matter our deeds, we both have the semblance of villains now. "
Nightwarden Minthara,Saviours of a city that we must now leave forever.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Not as conquerors, but as saviours. "
Nightwarden Minthara,Perhaps you are right. This may be for the best.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I think you are wrong. Given what you have become, there is nothing we can not do together."
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't let it happen again.
Nightwarden Minthara,We deserved to rule.
Nightwarden Minthara,Why did you not?
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will never understand it, and I do not accept it. But if this is what you choose, I will stay with you until the end."
Nightwarden Minthara,"All of your strength, all of your passion... all of your fire. Extinguished. Such a waste."
Nightwarden Minthara,Have you no dignity? Control yourself.
Nightwarden Minthara,Disappointing. But perhaps you lack the imagination to satisfy me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Be mine tonight, and you will know why."
Nightwarden Minthara,"In Menzoberranzan, the high-born would prostrate themselves before me for a fleeting taste of my body."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I leave your side, the Prism will no longer protect me, and I will cease to be Minthara. The Absolute will make me its puppet again."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would rather die.
Nightwarden Minthara,As a good leader should.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am no threat to you - I am at your mercy.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We have the same goal, and you have a better chance of achieving it with me at your side."
Nightwarden Minthara,Straj.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The next time we meet, I will kill you. In the Absolute's name, or my own."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now, thanks to the Prism, the Absolute does not cloud my thoughts at all. I see that together, we can have our vengeance on those who infected us."
Nightwarden Minthara,Strength will not save us from an enemy that can dominate our will.
Nightwarden Minthara,Broken minds can heal just as well as broken bones.
Nightwarden Minthara,I did not invite you to approach my tent. I need privacy while I recover from my ordeal at Moonrise.
Nightwarden Minthara,Slaughter them!
Nightwarden Minthara,For the Absolute!
Nightwarden Minthara,Your existence is blasphemy.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Dos orn el, ghil lu'nin."
Nightwarden Minthara,I was hoping to find you before you turned in for the night. My blood runs hot after the battle.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The best cure is vengeance, for both of us. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"A half-drow, but a True Soul? The Absolute's blessings may atone for the impurities of your blood."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Come, Shadowheart. Do you think prayers alone can keep an army on the march?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Not before time. They hoped to stand against Ketheric with little more than a trick of the light to protect them.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you intend to stray from Moonrise while Ketheric still lives, I shall remain at camp, strategising his downfall."
Nightwarden Minthara,Ketheric ruled from here for centuries. No more.
Nightwarden Minthara,I'll never forget how Ketheric humiliated me here.
Nightwarden Minthara,Few escape these cells. It's only thanks to you that I did.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Balthazar's chamber. Digging through the offal is unappealing, but may be worthwhile."
Nightwarden Minthara,No - please. Not you.
Nightwarden Minthara,So it is you who will end me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Not an instant longer than I must. Make haste.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Lead, then."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Prudent. Let us go, then - I will be your mute and faithful slave. For now."
Nightwarden Minthara,"An ill thing, to let an enemy show their back and live."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will put my faith in you, and pretend to be their slave."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would prefer to make these bastards bleed, but I trust that you speak from caution rather than cowardice."
Nightwarden Minthara,"But first, let's make these bastards bleed."
Nightwarden Minthara,I didn't dare hope... I owe you more than my life.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not. All that I did before you rescued me was as a puppet of the Absolute - it is behind me. Until Ketheric falls, only vengeance remains."
Nightwarden Minthara,Quickly. Kill them - we must leave.
Nightwarden Minthara,Good. We must press onwards.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Our enemies lie to the west, in Baldur's Gate. Do you intend to retreat from them?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now, lie down."
Nightwarden Minthara,You're here - good. Come with me.
Nightwarden Minthara,This is incredible... are we inside the Prism?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Explain yourself, illithid, or we will end you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"An unnerving revelation. But if this is our protector, so be it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A little more caution would be wise. Such power is tempting, but you risk losing yourself."
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not take this step without consulting me. You decide all of our fates.
Nightwarden Minthara,No - my love. You can't.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If this Nightsong is the source of Ketheric's power, we cannot let Balthazar take her. We should unleash her wrath."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I stand with you, Shadowheart. Slay the Nightsong, and take your place as a Dark Justiciar."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I wish I could kill that bloated sack of offal, but he may yet help us reach Ketheric."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I enjoy the spectacle of a hanging, but if our enemies accuse Florrick of treachery, she may be a useful ally."
Nightwarden Minthara,I approve. Any who dare to make me bleed should suffer dire consequences.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Good. If we return to the tower entrance and head north, we will find the Risen Road. The way should be clear now that the army has marched."
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not - I will return to camp and plan for the journey ahead. Find me there when you are ready.
Nightwarden Minthara,As you wish. Do not tarry long.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"Whatever it is, I sense it, somewhere below - furious, and hungry."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Even so, I cannot resist it while my tormentors live."
Nightwarden Minthara,"This thing, that speaks inside me - it has all but destroyed me. But... it fears you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will follow you to freedom, not into greater peril. I will hold here until you are done."
Nightwarden Minthara,I will speak when I am free.
Nightwarden Minthara,I think not - the pleasure will be all mine.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Oh, darling - I wish it hadn't come to this. But the pleasure will be all mine."
Nightwarden Minthara,Make haste. I fear that insidious voice will return if I linger here.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will pretend the interrogators finished their work, and feign obedience. They will think me a thrall."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Erasing my thoughts, and my will. Even I could not have endured for much longer."
Nightwarden Minthara,I didn't think anyone would come for me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I expected to be greeted as a hero - but the wretches imprisoned me, and tried to tear my mind apart."
Nightwarden Minthara,I serve the Absolute.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The voice... silenced. And my abusers, dead."
Nightwarden Minthara,We must leave. Now.
Nightwarden Minthara,I live to serve.
Nightwarden Minthara,Deal with them. Or I will.
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute.
Nightwarden Minthara,"The quicker, the better."
Nightwarden Minthara,What is it? What's wrong?
Nightwarden Minthara,We're between the Absolute's teeth and you ask me to sit still?
Nightwarden Minthara,"I last left Moonrise as a commander in the Absolute's army, obeying the voice of a god. I thought I had found a home... and a purpose."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You came. I prayed that you would, but there are no gods left to me."
Nightwarden Minthara,Ecstatic. Devoted. Inspired.
Nightwarden Minthara,None of you will break me.
Nightwarden Minthara,I obeyed to the best of my ability.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Liberating them may be a salve to your conscience, but it is not a kindness. The city's poorer quarters will be their feasthall."
Nightwarden Minthara,Glorious.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They will gnaw at their own flesh before long, in an effort to fight off the hunger. It would have been kinder, and less cowardly, to kill them."
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not speak. Just do as I say.
Nightwarden Minthara,You have no right - hnngnn.
Nightwarden Minthara,Vile beast - you are crueller than the cultists.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would - but I fear that without you, I will not be able to choose my own path."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I admire your confidence. But when you next see me, I may have the Absolute's armies at my back."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If I leave you, I fear the Absolute's voice will reach me again. And the next time we meet, one of us will die."
Nightwarden Minthara,Goodbye for now. I will see you soon.
Nightwarden Minthara,There is much we must discuss. Do you have a safe place to camp nearby?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now I leave as an exile. But you risked your life to rescue me - for that, I am grateful."
Nightwarden Minthara,The cult couldn't break me - what chance do you have?
Nightwarden Minthara,I have seen your mind - I know everything I need to know.
Nightwarden Minthara,Neither. It is an instruction.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now, silence. Lie down."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If She told me to, I would. But I do not hear Her... and perhaps that is a sign that you must live."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It screams. It silences the Absolute, and it screams. What is it? What are you?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"If this is a lie, it is a dangerous one. Show me."
Nightwarden Minthara,It seems the wizard kept his nerve. He destroyed the brain.
Nightwarden Minthara,"And we are cleansed. The tadpoles are still, at last."
Nightwarden Minthara,All it cost was a single wizard.
Nightwarden Minthara,"He recognised he was the least of us, and spent his life to ensure our survival. That showed wisdom."
Nightwarden Minthara,Perhaps that is what I deserve. I have failed Her. The weapon I seek is nowhere to be found.
Nightwarden Minthara,So much that has happened since I left the Underdark is like a dream of somebody else's life. I... do not know myself anymore.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are right... but I cannot deny what my heart tells me.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are right.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hold - this gathering has become altogether too civilised. Where is Karlach?
Nightwarden Minthara,"She is measuring out the last moments of her life. We should find her, and say our goodbyes."
Nightwarden Minthara,She has already lost her body to the tadpole... I hope she has not lost her mind. We should find her.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is as it should be. I hope you find peace.
Nightwarden Minthara,Or a sign that She has abandoned me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"And I am cleansed. The tadpole is still, at last."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And we are cleansed. The tadpoles are still, at last - they cannot control us, or turn us into abominations."
Nightwarden Minthara,We are free. No more gods or monsters except those of our own making.
Nightwarden Minthara,Then leave. You would only have disappointed me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Then go - rest. We will discuss our next move in the morning.
Nightwarden Minthara,I harnessed my fear long ago - it sharpens me. You would do well to do the same.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are incapable of harming me. Get out of my sight.
Nightwarden Minthara,That was not yours to see.
Nightwarden Minthara,"My body could have been yours, but some things are mine alone."
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute fell silent.
Nightwarden Minthara,What is that enticing aroma? Ah - I do believe the sun is cooking poor Astarion.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Will you go with them, Lae'zel? You would surely be heralded as a champion of your kind."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Lae'zel, no! You are destined for great things, child!"
Nightwarden Minthara,"The moment we were alone together, something changed. I felt it, and you must have felt it too."
Nightwarden Minthara,I don't believe you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I must pray, and you must rest. Tomorrow we will have fresh orders."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Except tonight. Tonight, I wanted this - for myself."
Nightwarden Minthara,This is blasphemy... but so much that has happened since I left the Underdark is like a dream of somebody else's life. I... do not know myself anymore.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is done - the Absolute eradicated, vengeance exacted."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The githyanki leave, at last. I feared they would make this world their own."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your Sharran kin are responsible for this ruin. They purged these lands even before the shadow curse, and pillaged all they could find."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Quiet - if She hears you, She will kill us both. I have felt Her love, but I have also seen Her wrath. Those who turn from Her grace die screaming."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The Absolute was silent, and - strange to say - that brought me comfort."
Nightwarden Minthara,And you shall have me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your obedience will make this more enjoyable for both of us. Tell me what you want.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Although in your case, the transformation may be an improvement."
Nightwarden Minthara,"No, it was honest."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Strange. But perhaps when I see your enemies cower at your feet, trembling, I will envy you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And yet it was you who did it. The world will not thank you - it will fear you - but you have my gratitude, for whatever its worth to you.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"The whole world owes you, but expect their fear rather than their gratitude. You have my thanks though, for whatever they are worth.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"I doubt the world will appreciate your sacrifice. More likely, it will fear and shun you. But you have my thanks, for whatever they are worth.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Without you, the brain would have enthralled me again. I would rather die... I owe you everything."
Nightwarden Minthara,He served his purpose. And you have served yours. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"He does not deserve to be an outcast. I hope he finds peace, wherever he makes his home."
Nightwarden Minthara,We would not have survived any of this without him. May he find peace.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do what you must, Lae'zel. But make it quick - we would have perished long ago without his protection."
Nightwarden Minthara,You learn fast.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I feel your mind, Karlach. It is immense - it is beautiful."
Nightwarden Minthara,I would have you by my side in Menzoberranzan when our work on the surface is done.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I feel your mind evolving, Karlach... it is beautiful. You are more alive than ever."
Nightwarden Minthara,Speak to me. Tell me what is in your heart.
Nightwarden Minthara,"No. I want the truth. I want to hear it in your voice, not in my mind."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Only cowards submit to slavery or imprisonment willingly. If you do not trust your own mind, you should have the courage to destroy yourself."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Wizard - was your brain entirely liquified during the battle? The fight is over, it's time to move on."
Nightwarden Minthara,What say you? I think we deserve a drink to celebrate surviving that horror.
Nightwarden Minthara,That's the wisest idea the wizard's had yet. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"As it is, our future is uncertain, and we must face it without divinity, without our illithid powers, as mortals. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"As did I. During the battle, my mind raced, my blood burned... I was righteous. But tonight, I only heard your breath and your voice."
Nightwarden Minthara,Perhaps one day the planes will quake as Mystra and Gale clash for control of the Weave. I would not bet against our wizard if it does come to pass.
Nightwarden Minthara,I could say the same of you. There is something about you that disturbs me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I envy him. If we had dominated the brain, we would be greater than gods. "
Nightwarden Minthara,That we have survived is a miracle. I propose we celebrate with whatever filth passes as wine in this city.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You seem distracted, wizard. I can no longer spy your thoughts - so speak them."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are a wise enough man to know that one should not expect kindness from the gods, Gale."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I wish you well. And if Mystra stands in your way, call on me, wizard. I have acquired a taste for killing gods."
Nightwarden Minthara,To accept death is to surrender. 
Nightwarden Minthara,I only heard your breath and your voice.
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute owns my mind. I cannot remember a time when her voice did not fill it. Except tonight... tonight the Absolute was silent.
Nightwarden Minthara,What shall we do with our liberty?
Nightwarden Minthara,"A True Soul? Praise be, sister. Are you here to join my hunt?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are speaking of my home, spawn. It is pleasant to be reminded of it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Join me and my warband at the entrance. Either it falls, or you do."
Nightwarden Minthara,Hardly worth my time.
Nightwarden Minthara,As you wish.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Of course.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,To what end?<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Simple.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,What next?<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,We should have minions for such tasks.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,If I must.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Too easy.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,I am tempted to leave you.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,What foolishness is this?<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Try to keep up.
Nightwarden Minthara,Veiled in shadow.
Nightwarden Minthara,I belong in darkness.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Unseen, I shall strike.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,Oloth dos.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will protect you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Death comes quietly.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am here - do not be afraid.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not leave me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Sweet dreams.
Nightwarden Minthara,Listen.<br><br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Hear me.<br><br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Psst.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"Hold, and listen.<br><br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I speak, you listen.<br><br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,Pitiful - you need me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not fail me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Impress me, if you can."
Nightwarden Minthara,I can mend your flesh.
Nightwarden Minthara,Easily fixed.
Nightwarden Minthara,None shall harm you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"We will survive this, together."
Nightwarden Minthara,I will not let you fall.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are mine. I will not lose you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Show courage. I will not leave you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are safe, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,No one can take you from me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Sleep now, forever."
Nightwarden Minthara,The shadows are my friend.
Nightwarden Minthara,Kyone.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am veiled.
Nightwarden Minthara,With caution.
Nightwarden Minthara,None shall see me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Cunning.
Nightwarden Minthara,To what end?
Nightwarden Minthara,We should have minions for such tasks.
Nightwarden Minthara,Too easy.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have you, my love. Do not fear."
Nightwarden Minthara,Whisper your command.
Nightwarden Minthara,Not now.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,I am the shadows.
Nightwarden Minthara,Darkness is my home.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Speak quickly.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not distract me.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,You can see me?
Nightwarden Minthara,Need a throat slitting?
Nightwarden Minthara,Who shall I silence?
Nightwarden Minthara,Hush.
Nightwarden Minthara,Brorn.
Nightwarden Minthara,Like a whisper.
Nightwarden Minthara,Soft as silk.
Nightwarden Minthara,Without warning.
Nightwarden Minthara,From silence to suffering.
Nightwarden Minthara,None will find me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't let this happen again.
Nightwarden Minthara,An amusing plight.<br><br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Take more care.<br><br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Come.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Steel yourself.
Nightwarden Minthara,Stand strong.
Nightwarden Minthara,Use this.
Nightwarden Minthara,Aid from the darkness.
Nightwarden Minthara,Strength from the shadows.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,You are not finished yet.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Back to the fight, soldier."
Nightwarden Minthara,I won't let you fall.
Nightwarden Minthara,Like a shadow.
Nightwarden Minthara,Quiet as a cloaker.
Nightwarden Minthara,I see a path.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hush now.
Nightwarden Minthara,Go quietly into the night.
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not have time for interruptions from underlings.
Nightwarden Minthara,Searching.
Nightwarden Minthara,What's inside?
Nightwarden Minthara,You will fight another day.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will not lose you.
Nightwarden Minthara,You will survive this.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your body is mine - let me fix it.
Nightwarden Minthara,Shadows sustain you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your flesh will mend.
Nightwarden Minthara,Show no weakness.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not fade.
Nightwarden Minthara,I think I have it.
Nightwarden Minthara,What is it hiding...
Nightwarden Minthara,Clumsy tools.
Nightwarden Minthara,I only need a moment.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Open, damn you."
Nightwarden Minthara,A subtle art.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not rush me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Anything of value?
Nightwarden Minthara,A delicate process.
Nightwarden Minthara,I slip into shadows.
Nightwarden Minthara,From shadow I will strike.
Nightwarden Minthara,I can soothe your pain.
Nightwarden Minthara,Recover your strength.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your flesh shall mend.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Fail, and I kill you myself."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Try to be more careful, darling."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You had my attention, now you have my fury."
Nightwarden Minthara,Phlar Lolth ssinssrickla.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your suffering will be spectacular.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Stop, or die."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am tempted to leave you.
Nightwarden Minthara,An amusing plight.
Nightwarden Minthara,Take more care.
Nightwarden Minthara,A waste of my time.
Nightwarden Minthara,What foolishness is this?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Swift, silent, deadly."
Nightwarden Minthara,Velkyn.
Nightwarden Minthara,The darkness is my home.
Nightwarden Minthara,Veldryn.
Nightwarden Minthara,Gaining ground.
Nightwarden Minthara,I lead the way.
Nightwarden Minthara,Advance.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I speak, you listen.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,I would have words with you.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Try not to bleed so much.
Nightwarden Minthara,Are you even trying to survive?
Nightwarden Minthara,You are a waste of my talents.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Back to the fight, coward!"
Nightwarden Minthara,You are weak - get back in the fight.
Nightwarden Minthara,You scarcely deserve this.
Nightwarden Minthara,Attend to me. Now.
Nightwarden Minthara,Lend me your ear.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,You. Listen.
Nightwarden Minthara,You can die later. I still need you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Stop wasting time.
Nightwarden Minthara,Attend to me. Now.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,You. Listen.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"Listen, worm.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,From the shadows.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"Hold, and listen.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,Psst.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hear me.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Listen.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Orders received.
Nightwarden Minthara,At your bidding.
Nightwarden Minthara,The path is set.
Nightwarden Minthara,Moving out.
Nightwarden Minthara,Quick march.
Nightwarden Minthara,Into position.
Nightwarden Minthara,Advancing.
Nightwarden Minthara,Forward.
Nightwarden Minthara,I can kill with a whisper.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,If you are sure.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is ours.
Nightwarden Minthara,I shall seize it.
Nightwarden Minthara,It shall be mine.
Nightwarden Minthara,Retrieved.
Nightwarden Minthara,Secured.
Nightwarden Minthara,Quietly does it.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hush. I have it.
Nightwarden Minthara,Confiscated.
Nightwarden Minthara,Out of my way.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not struggle, I have you."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Soft, silent, lethal."
Nightwarden Minthara,We are stronger together.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Karlach is desperate for somebody to fill the hole where her heart used to be.
Nightwarden Minthara,"But you made it clear that you are mine, and mine alone."
Nightwarden Minthara,Let the others desire you - let them desire us both. They cannot have us so long as we belong to one another.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Dismiss your doubts. If I cannot be sure of your devotion to me, I would prefer not to share my body or mind with you at all."
Nightwarden Minthara,You wish to consult me?
Nightwarden Minthara,It means love.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is not a word I ever expected to say.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I have had many lovers, but none ever earned my trust and affection as you have."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then cast the word from your thoughts and never think of it again. It should be easy enough given how much escapes that mind of yours.
Nightwarden Minthara,The Guild's hold on the city's criminal enterprises is slipping.
Nightwarden Minthara,They are vulnerable because they have not had enough competition in recent times.
Nightwarden Minthara,"In Menzoberranzan, my House has been the most significant power for thousands of years, but it has never been a peaceful reign. That is by design."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We do not eradicate our enemies entirely because they make us strong. And if there is no external threat, we turn our knives on one another."
Nightwarden Minthara,It is only through competition that any of us can remain strong. The Guild may have become too comfortable to remember that.
Nightwarden Minthara,A frontal assault against such formidable foes would be ill-advised. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"If you fight an army, kill the general and the troops will disperse. If you fight a giant, lacerate its tendons and spine to bring it down to size."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We cannot hope to dismantle every Watcher, so we should avoid their attention until we can strike their nerve centre."
Nightwarden Minthara,You do not shy from the parasite's powers.
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is rare that gnomes prove useful, but the runepowder bomb the Ironhands provided should be our weapon of choice."
Nightwarden Minthara,Can I take their life as well?
Nightwarden Minthara,Skilfully done.
Nightwarden Minthara,Steady yourself.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,I won't leave you.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't struggle. I have you.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,I am coming.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,I will never let you fall.
Nightwarden Minthara,Stop squirming.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not let this happen again.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am tempted to let you bleed.
Nightwarden Minthara,Stop complaining.
Nightwarden Minthara,Collected.
Nightwarden Minthara,At your word.
Nightwarden Minthara,Intriguing.
Nightwarden Minthara,Next I take their life.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is mine now.
Nightwarden Minthara,Perfectly executed.
Nightwarden Minthara,I could take their life as easily.
Nightwarden Minthara,They know nothing.
Nightwarden Minthara,Superb.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not panic.
Nightwarden Minthara,That is only relevant if we also need their help.
Nightwarden Minthara,These people are nothing to us. Why should we care if the knife does its work?
Nightwarden Minthara,"We could melt every Steel Watcher down to dross and change nothing. We cannot stop an idea, and we cannot stop progress."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And nor should we. Instead, it falls to us to make sure we control the idea and profit from progress."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We must find the Temple of Bhaal, slaughter Orin, and claim your inheritance."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Then I will rule by your side, my slayer."
Nightwarden Minthara,Ecstatically so. It makes my heart race.
Nightwarden Minthara,You must. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Yours is a heritage of murder. It cannot be ignored or evaded. You will either kill or be killed.
Nightwarden Minthara,You cannot deny your own blood.
Nightwarden Minthara,A child of Bhaal? What horrors your mind must hold.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are heir to a divine inheritance that few would be able to command... but I believe you could.
Nightwarden Minthara,To reject it would be to reject godhood. You would lose the possibility of shaping the world to fit your desires.
Nightwarden Minthara,And you would lose me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Bhaal is not like the Absolute. He will not control you... he will unleash you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Tell me. Or show me. My mind is open to you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I would rather we were all free of the gods, but Shadowheart's connection to Shar may provide her access to the city's Sharran cloister."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If they serve her, they serve us, and we need every possible ally."
Nightwarden Minthara,He is the only authority figure in Baldur's Gate worth a damn.
Nightwarden Minthara,"That is why we should make sure we are the ones giving the orders, rather than the ones on the receiving end of them."
Nightwarden Minthara,Controlling an unruly slave by holding a knife to the throat of their child is a time-honoured tactic - the collars and hostages work on the same principle.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Without bloodshed on the winning side, perhaps. The machines will always need something to kill, if only to show their strength."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The tools used to construct and control them may well be here in the city. If we were to control Baldur's Gate, the Steel Watch could be ours."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not be fooled by their appearance. The Watchers are forged and cast like machines, but they are a hivemind like any other. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"A central intelligence guides them. If we find the source of that intelligence, we can destroy it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We will need every advantage to survive the battles that are to come, and my illithid parasite has already shown its worth."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If this superior tadpole is capable of unlocking my mind's full potential, it is a tempting proposition."
Nightwarden Minthara,Its influence on you is plain to see - you are sublime.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am surprised you have not drawn on its power yourself.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will be unstoppable.
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not want a devil to hold my fate in his hands any more than a god.
Nightwarden Minthara,Aren't you tired of bowing and begging for scraps of power from your patron?
Nightwarden Minthara,Aren't you tired of bowing and praying before authority figures?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Dealing with Raphael was foolish, but understandable. Giving him the Crown would be a grave error though."
Nightwarden Minthara,"If anyone should have that power, it should be us."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I say we put the devil from our minds, and trust in ourselves. If anyone should have the power of the Crown, it should be us."
Nightwarden Minthara,No. They seem to combine the obedience and strength of a golem with the precision and intelligence of their creator.
Nightwarden Minthara,"For now, they act as a defensive wall of steel, but their true purpose is conquest. Mechanised slaughter."
Nightwarden Minthara,Imagine how quickly the grove would have fallen if we had machines like those to command. Imagine how quickly a city would fall.
Nightwarden Minthara,Gortash has revolutionised warfare.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Better to control the elder brain though. Iron crumbles, steel breaks, but the power of a thought or an idea can be infinite.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,I come for you.
Nightwarden Minthara,No fear - I will save you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't get yourself killed.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,By my oath.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,In your name.
Nightwarden Minthara,Who's next?<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Do we have a target?<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Our enemies still draw breath.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,I hope this is important. For your sake.
Nightwarden Minthara,If it is for the best.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am listening.
Nightwarden Minthara,Our enemies are everywhere.
Nightwarden Minthara,There can be no respite.
Nightwarden Minthara,Reporting.
Nightwarden Minthara,Why leave them alive?
Nightwarden Minthara,"First their possessions, then their lives."
Nightwarden Minthara,I will take it all.
Nightwarden Minthara,Steady yourself.
Nightwarden Minthara,I won't leave you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't struggle. I have you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Awaiting orders.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Unfortunate.
Nightwarden Minthara,You need my expertise?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Try to be more careful, darling.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not go into the light.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Take courage, I will not let you fall."
Nightwarden Minthara,There is life in you yet.
Nightwarden Minthara,Steady your nerves - I have you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Did I give you permission to die?
Nightwarden Minthara,This is not your end.
Nightwarden Minthara,We cannot afford to lose you.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am tempted to leave you.<br><br>
Nightwarden Minthara,What foolishness is this?<br><br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Try to keep up.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Are you incapable?
Nightwarden Minthara,Stop squirming. I'm coming.
Nightwarden Minthara,"This city needs a leader of steel and scar, not silk and silver. Do you think you can be that man, Wyll Ravengard?"
Nightwarden Minthara,The people are as likely to crown me as their queen as they are to accept a devil as their duke.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am coming, my love.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not struggle, I have you.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,I will free you.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Have no fear.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Clumsy.
Nightwarden Minthara,You will be fine.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am coming.
Nightwarden Minthara,All better?
Nightwarden Minthara,No more slip-ups.
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't get yourself killed.
Nightwarden Minthara,We don't have time for this.
Nightwarden Minthara,Clumsy fool.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Strength from shadows.
Nightwarden Minthara,You will not fail.
Nightwarden Minthara,None can stop us.
Nightwarden Minthara,I watch over you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Let me soothe your pain, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,I will not let them harm you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Back to the fight, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,None can survive us.
Nightwarden Minthara,Unleash fury.
Nightwarden Minthara,Bleed them!
Nightwarden Minthara,I need you in the fight.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,No harm will come to you.
Nightwarden Minthara,This will make them suffer.
Nightwarden Minthara,An improvement.
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not squander my gifts.
Nightwarden Minthara,"No retreat, no surrender."
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not falter.
Nightwarden Minthara,You need me.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Without me, you are nothing."
Nightwarden Minthara,"With my aid, you are adequate."
Nightwarden Minthara,This will keep you on your feet.
Nightwarden Minthara,Take my strength.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your power grows.
Nightwarden Minthara,Unleash your potential.
Nightwarden Minthara,You have my aid.
Nightwarden Minthara,Ready yourself.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Listen, friend.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,A word?
Nightwarden Minthara,"A moment, please."
Nightwarden Minthara,I must consult you.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,A pressing matter.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Hear me, my love.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,You will wish I had stayed in hiding.
Nightwarden Minthara,My strength is yours.
Nightwarden Minthara,Attend to me.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"I am coming, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am oblivion.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not leave me, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,Then do as you were ordered.
Nightwarden Minthara,But you - I can see you are different. Faithful to the last.
Nightwarden Minthara,"They are flocking to the Absolute. In sufficient numbers, they are an effective force. Expendable and willing."
Nightwarden Minthara,"You are most eager, True Soul. All will be revealed come dawn."
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute knows your zeal. And She has so much more to give.
Nightwarden Minthara,Look at me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Yes - I suppose I might offer you passage. But first you will obey my command in Her mighty name.
Nightwarden Minthara,I trust you have cleared your mind? I hunger for battle. We must find the sanctuary.
Nightwarden Minthara,"A drow? Tell me, Sazza, did your misadventures take you to the Underdark?"
Nightwarden Minthara,Praise be to Her!
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute will reward us.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I will gather my warband, and reach the grove by next light. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Once we are in position, we will wait for your signal, and then we will break them all."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Good. Marshalling the goblins is no simple matter, but my warband will be ready to attack by next light."
Nightwarden Minthara,"The Absolute loves you, True Soul. And serving Her, as you have, is the path to true power."
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute brought you here for a reason - to throw open those gates and crush our enemies.
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not intend to lead a suicidal charge. The goblins are expendable; I am not.
Nightwarden Minthara,Enduring that self-righteous poetry was a greater trial than any of the ones we bypassed.
Nightwarden Minthara,The true honour is to serve the Absolute. She loves you fiercely; I see that in the strength She has given you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Their god is weak. Roots and branches will not save them from the Absolute's fury.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will gather my warband - we will reach the grove by next light.
Nightwarden Minthara,"But we can still fight side by side. Together, we will destroy any who have not died or fled."
Nightwarden Minthara,You started the slaughter without me? How selfish.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Return to the grove. When my raiding party approaches, throw open the gate and signal me."
Nightwarden Minthara,You have a part to play in this slaughter.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Did he, now? Let me guess: the snivelling brat's failed his duty. Nothing if not expected."
Nightwarden Minthara,"They are vermin - sacred only to the false goddess Lolth. She has no power here, among the Absolute's Chosen."
Nightwarden Minthara,"It is time to continue the hunt, True Soul. I hunger for battle."
Nightwarden Minthara,I will gather my forces - we will reach the grove by next light.
Nightwarden Minthara,We can be the reminder. Soft citizens make easy targets.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Is the little dog trying to intimidate us? If it continues to bark, I will snap its neck."
Nightwarden Minthara,The child ignores you. Would you like me to dispose of her?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Ravengard is still alive, trapped in his own mind. Just as I was."
Nightwarden Minthara,How do Baldurans punish traitors? Hanging? Dismemberment? I hope we get to see.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If he holds all the stones, he holds all the power. We must keep our portion if this alliance is to endure."
Nightwarden Minthara,"He wants what we want - Orin dead, and the elder brain subjugated. An alliance would serve us well."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your vengeance is complete, Karlach. Do you not feel joy?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Your vengeance is complete, Karlach. You should rejoice."
Nightwarden Minthara,Vengeance can be a bitter tonic to kind hearts. Give her a moment.
Nightwarden Minthara,The True Soul has already begun the slaughter. Break down the gate!
Nightwarden Minthara,The True Soul has already begun the slaughter. Charge!
Nightwarden Minthara,And it seems that the inhabitants of the grove trust you - we can use that against them.
Nightwarden Minthara,My strength is your strength.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Absolute, guide me."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I await your command, Absolute."
Nightwarden Minthara,Hm. So many cuts. The goblins were eager with this one. 
Nightwarden Minthara,To flee the fires of Avernus only to fall here - this is the power of the Absolute.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"So young. But then, weren't they all?"
Nightwarden Minthara,So much blood. So easily spilled.
Nightwarden Minthara,There are more - hunt them down!
Nightwarden Minthara,Praise the Absolute! She will reward us well for this exquisite carnage.
Nightwarden Minthara,Shameful to be killed by your own son. That honour should fall to a daughter.
Nightwarden Minthara,"There were few left alive - you began the slaughter without me, I assume?"
Nightwarden Minthara,I will gather my forces nonetheless and reach the grove by next light.
Nightwarden Minthara,And you allowed them to do this? You were ordered to expose them.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your authority is my law.
Nightwarden Minthara,Seems you've been paying more attention to my techniques than I realised. I am flattered.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Through sheer luck, that pathetic worm has brought me the information I need."
Nightwarden Minthara,I know my heart - and yours - better than this creature ever will. But we can indulge it if you wish.
Nightwarden Minthara,A pretty speech. It almost brings a tear to my eye. 
Nightwarden Minthara,"Now slit his throat, and open that gate. The Absolute wants all of them dead."
Nightwarden Minthara,I'll dissect you.
Nightwarden Minthara,You cower behind a doomed god when the Absolute promised you such power?
Nightwarden Minthara,You will die here. And your god will die with you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Sacred? It is filth. It will burn, and you will burn with it."
Nightwarden Minthara,"A duergar? Tell me, Sazza, did your misadventures take you to the Underdark?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"I presume you dealt with my prey, and massacred the rest?"
Nightwarden Minthara,"Oh dear. Your prisoner is one of the Absolute's favourites, Sazza. A True Soul."
Nightwarden Minthara,"And it will be your last. My spiders are hungry, little one..."
Nightwarden Minthara,"...but before they feast, tell me where that grove is, and I may yet spare your life."
Nightwarden Minthara,I will not hurt you. My spiders will have that pleasure.
Nightwarden Minthara,"No. And if you refer to me as 'my dear' again, I will cut out your tongue."
Nightwarden Minthara,The creature need not look into our hearts to see that I barely tolerate your existence.
Nightwarden Minthara,It is true. Surface food lacks flavour. House Baenre banquets were legendary.
Nightwarden Minthara,There was no love to be found. My mother would have poisoned her own milk to torment me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Spiders are Lolth's creatures - as was I. Her cult controlled me just as the Absolute did. Not a pleasant memory at all.
Nightwarden Minthara,Self-deprecation is not endearing. It is demeaning.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Without Lolth or the Absolute, I am free for the first time. Some may call it exile, I call it independence."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I had always kept my heart hidden, but I allowed you to see it. To see me. It saddens me that you saw a stranger instead.<br>"
Nightwarden Minthara,Are we finished? You were only mildly disappointing. Well done.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You know my heart, and I am glad. You are the first."
Nightwarden Minthara,That haunts me more than anything they did to me.
Nightwarden Minthara,I do not know what weakness of mine allowed them to take me. 
Nightwarden Minthara,I barely remember the grove... I was not myself. But my only regret is that I exerted myself in the name of a false god.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Exquisite work, True Soul. Now we must make sure nothing is hidden in their lair. Join me there."
Nightwarden Minthara,Open the gate.
Nightwarden Minthara,Kill them!
Nightwarden Minthara,Then you are worthless.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Fine. But if this creature can truly look into my heart, it best be careful what it reveals."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Not just siblings. Androcide, senicide, avunculicide - I only regret I left before enjoying a matricide. That would be a memory to cherish."
Nightwarden Minthara,Presumptious. But not inaccurate. You have earned my companionship - that is no easy task.
Nightwarden Minthara,I think not. The gods are more fickle than the fools who follow them.
Nightwarden Minthara,And She has so much more to give.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will free you.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will come to your camp tonight. We will celebrate this victory. Together.
Nightwarden Minthara,All will be revealed come dawn.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Until then, let us revel. The Absolute demands no less."
Nightwarden Minthara,The Absolute did not bring you here to assist me - She brought you here to die.
Nightwarden Minthara,You dare to challenge me?
Nightwarden Minthara,"Greater drow than you have challenged me, sister. The Underdark is thick with their blood. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"Silence, wretch. And remember - you owe your miserable life to this one. "
Nightwarden Minthara,"I don't like to share. Lay a finger on them, and I'll cut you."
Nightwarden Minthara,A glorious day. The Absolute will be pleased.
Nightwarden Minthara,But there is more to be done. This place is home to druids - root them out and kill them.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When you are done, we will celebrate our victory at your camp."
Nightwarden Minthara,"I expect great things of you - when the battle begins, show me your worth."
Nightwarden Minthara,"We will discuss the matter later. First, we lay waste to this forsaken grove."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Praise the Absolute, sister! She will reward us well for this exquisite carnage."
Nightwarden Minthara,Find the druids. Bleed them dry.
Nightwarden Minthara,The druids' enchantment is impassable. You should have killed them before they sealed their grove.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are alive? Not for long.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your overeagerness to spill blood has led the inhabitants to cower behind this enchantment. 
Nightwarden Minthara,Your orders were to infiltrate this place so we could purge it together.
Nightwarden Minthara,And you are weaker than I hoped.
Nightwarden Minthara,"If this goes ahead, her luck will run out rather quickly."
Nightwarden Minthara,You make killing sound quite dull. Where's the passion?
Nightwarden Minthara,How thoughtful. And where did you find this friend?
Nightwarden Minthara,Haunted by the fallen...
Nightwarden Minthara,Do not fall again.
Nightwarden Minthara,You're more feeble than a goblin.
Nightwarden Minthara,"You will stand, and you will fight."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Do not play dead, coward."
Nightwarden Minthara,Hardly worth the effort.
Nightwarden Minthara,You fight poorly.
Nightwarden Minthara,On your feet - that's an order.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Up, weakling."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Stand, and prove your worth."
Nightwarden Minthara,Ssussun pholor dos.
Nightwarden Minthara,Ready for battle.
Nightwarden Minthara,My victims await.
Nightwarden Minthara,On your command.
Nightwarden Minthara,I thirst for combat.
Nightwarden Minthara,A wise move.
Nightwarden Minthara,I seek an advantage.
Nightwarden Minthara,Taking up position.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will not fail.
Nightwarden Minthara,A bold manoeuvre.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am your end.
Nightwarden Minthara,This is beneath me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Suffer!
Nightwarden Minthara,I prefer to take lives.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would have words with you.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Hold, and listen."
Nightwarden Minthara,Attend to me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Hear me.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will end them.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Away, spirit. Do not test me."
Nightwarden Minthara,By my oath!
Nightwarden Minthara,Strike them down.
Nightwarden Minthara,I live for battle.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Take strength, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,"Together, we are unstoppable."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am your shield.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Kill them, in our name."
Nightwarden Minthara,"My strength is yours, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,Together we are perfection.
Nightwarden Minthara,The rich get richer.
Nightwarden Minthara,Let me perfect you.
Nightwarden Minthara,My gift to you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Make this count.
Nightwarden Minthara,You are nothing without me.
Nightwarden Minthara,Fresh orders?
Nightwarden Minthara,Now you die.
Nightwarden Minthara,Bleed them dry.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your command?
Nightwarden Minthara,Death comes for them.
Nightwarden Minthara,Let me strike.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am death.
Nightwarden Minthara,"When I speak, you listen."
Nightwarden Minthara,I am your strength.
Nightwarden Minthara,What's yours is mine.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would shrug off such light wounds.
Nightwarden Minthara,This will hurt.
Nightwarden Minthara,I am your death.
Nightwarden Minthara,I cannot lose you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Weak.
Nightwarden Minthara,Tsk.
Nightwarden Minthara,Stop dawdling.
Nightwarden Minthara,Incompetence.
Nightwarden Minthara,Take more care.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,An amusing plight.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Scarcely worth the effort.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,Don't let this happen again.<br>
Nightwarden Minthara,"On your feet, soldier."
Nightwarden Minthara,"By my oath, you will not fall."
Nightwarden Minthara,A cold chill. Spirits walk among us.
Nightwarden Minthara,I will not leave you behind.
Nightwarden Minthara,These wounds will heal.
Nightwarden Minthara,"I do not know how you can be the Blade of Frontiers again, after all we have seen and done. The past is dead."
Nightwarden Minthara,We are stronger together.
Nightwarden Minthara,You have managed to survive without me. A welcome surprise.
Nightwarden Minthara,I expect there have been other reunions to which I was not invited. Hmph.
Nightwarden Minthara,I fear I am becoming accustomed to the taste of sun-fed plants.
Nightwarden Minthara,A gathering of heroes... a fine target for our enemies.
Nightwarden Minthara,I would kill for a glass of Ulaver wine.
Nightwarden Minthara,Come back to me.
Nightwarden Minthara,L'il alurl.
Nightwarden Minthara,Vengeance!
Nightwarden Minthara,Clumsy fool.
Nightwarden Minthara,By my oath.
Nightwarden Minthara,Weapons ready.
Nightwarden Minthara,Steady yourself - I have you.
Nightwarden Minthara,You will live.
Nightwarden Minthara,Your fight is not over.
Nightwarden Minthara,No rest for the wicked.
Nightwarden Minthara,You will break.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Hear me, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,I must confide in you.
Nightwarden Minthara,Olot dos!
Nightwarden Minthara,Time to bleed.
Nightwarden Minthara,"Listen, my love."
Nightwarden Minthara,My love.
Nightwarden Minthara,Oloth plynn dos!
Nightwarden Minthara,No survivors!
Nightwarden Minthara,L'il alurl!
Nightwarden Minthara,"Next, I take their life."
Nightwarden Minthara,I will enjoy this.
Nightwarden Minthara,Blissfully ignorant.
Nightwarden Minthara,Ssussun pholor dos!
Nightwarden Minthara,No mercy!
Nightwarden Minthara,I have it.
Shadowheart,I can't do this.
Shadowheart,That wasn't for you to hear.
Shadowheart,Now let me pray. This is important.
Shadowheart,"I do. I'm amazed you missed the signs, honestly."
Shadowheart,This must be the last step. I need to pray. Only by Lady Shar's grace did we even make it this far.
Shadowheart,I have no need of the spear.
Shadowheart,"I don't care what you believe, Lae'zel. Go to sleep."
Shadowheart,I needn't have woken you at all. I could've just buried this dagger in your throat.<br>
Shadowheart,"Fine. It's a lucky keepsake, nothing more. I found it in a flea market."
Shadowheart,"It's simple - I have a mission. It need not concern you - and as long as you don't interfere, it'll bring you no harm."
Shadowheart,"Such glory, for one life? Why is this one so important, my Lady?"
Shadowheart,"I will do as you ask, Lady Shar."
Shadowheart,"What do you need of me, my Lady?"
Shadowheart,"As you command, Nightsinger."
Shadowheart,I'm not sure I can continue.
Shadowheart,Listen.
Shadowheart,"Another time, I'm terribly tired. You should get some rest, Lae'zel."
Shadowheart,"When the time comes for me to do my duty, stand aside."
Shadowheart,"Oh. You don't say that because of the company, I hope?"
Shadowheart,"Not that it matters, but her reward aligns with your own interests."
Shadowheart,I gave you every chance. Now you've forced my hand.
Shadowheart,I'm sorry. I serve the Dark Lady. I'll dedicate the loss of you to her.
Shadowheart,"Yes, we're right where we need to be, under her gaze. This is the right path - let's continue."
Shadowheart,We should get some rest. I doubt tomorrow will be any easier than today.
Shadowheart,Good. Somewhere in the library there should be an image of my Lady that we can shroud in darkness. The spear should reveal itself.
Shadowheart,I'm glad you changed your mind. Otherwise that would have been the end for us. I don't want it to be the end.
Shadowheart,Please. Don't make me do this - not after all we've been through.
Shadowheart,"I know how you feel, trust me. But there's not much we can do until morning."
Shadowheart,It's simple. My Lady Shar demands a sacrifice. One life.
Shadowheart,You'd be wise to turn a blind eye. I won't fail - not when I'm this close.
Shadowheart,My Lady does not want you to.
Shadowheart,No. Not yet. We can't go on - not without the Spear of Night. We must return to the library.
Shadowheart,"With good reason, it seems."
Shadowheart,"You're welcome to try. Otherwise, back off."
Shadowheart,Just remember what I said - let me do what I need to. 
Shadowheart,You will not stand in my way. Draw your weapon.
Shadowheart,Please. How many breathed their last just so we could make it this far? Trust me. This will help us.
Shadowheart,"The tadpole, you mean? It's not that simple, not anymore. The Nightsinger herself has made her will known. She comes before all others."
Shadowheart,It's not for me to question that - or for you. We live to serve.
Shadowheart,Lae'zel. You're not really the type for idle chatter. Don't develop the habit now.
Shadowheart,"Ready, unseen."
Shadowheart,"I don't know what qualifies as manners with your kind, but in Faerûn it's rude to stare."
Shadowheart,"Agh... I felt that. Get away from me, gith!"
Shadowheart,"You didn't seek to gather the Harpers for one last charge? Fodder for heroic ballads yet to be written, perhaps."
Shadowheart,Need to tread softly.
Shadowheart,Best step softly.
Shadowheart,No time to dally.
Shadowheart,Better tread carefully.
Shadowheart,No time for pain.
Shadowheart,You need patching up.
Shadowheart,Sounds much like the Sharrans - hopefully that's where the similarities end.
Shadowheart,Did you do that on purpose...?
Shadowheart,"I've considered them plenty. Besides, Lady Shar favours action over words. Try it out, sometime."
Shadowheart,Those who do not listen to the reason of Lady Shar words must instead feel the keenness of her blade.
Shadowheart,"Then go read a book, or pray to your god of choice - just leave me alone."
Shadowheart,"Hmm. In that case, let me spare you the worst. Good night."
Shadowheart,You should get some rest. Things will seem better come morning. I hope.
Shadowheart,Should've kept your focus on me.
Shadowheart,"Shar take you both, then."
Shadowheart,You should have taken your own advice.
Shadowheart,"Oh come on, you have to be at least a little impressed by the craftsmanship. There's only so much you can do with wood."
Shadowheart,"You had every chance to look the other way, but here we are. You chose this."
Shadowheart,You must have been following the example of Lady Shar's children then - they do say imitation is a form of flattery.
Shadowheart,"Perhaps she took some pride in her work, forming me to Shar's liking. She certainly relished wielding the rod.."
Shadowheart,"You don't understand. There's something I need to do, or the trials will have been in vain."
Shadowheart,It's fine. But we're on the right path. I'm right where I need to be - under Lady Shar's gaze. 
Shadowheart,"Thank you, kin. I'll remember your help, if I succeed. As will my Lady."
Shadowheart,"I'm being interrupted, that's what. We can talk later."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar's presence. I felt her too - we're right where we need to be, under her gaze. This is the right path - let's continue."
Shadowheart,"But you consort with a better class of people now, right?"
Shadowheart,Keep out of it.
Shadowheart,"Let's just stop this conversation right here, shall we?"
Shadowheart,"I knew her well enough. You might have travelled with her for a time, but she trained me. What's your point?"
Shadowheart,I suppose you don't have much use for hospitals... unless you're seeking to steal their blood stock.
Shadowheart,"I said keep out of it. In fact, forget it entirely."
Shadowheart,I see a way.
Shadowheart,Lady Shar's children toil similarly... but we know there is no need to seek the favour of others. Our lady's love is all we need.
Shadowheart,"Hmph, sounds familiar."
Shadowheart,"It is always wise to have another redoubt, another escape route. Though I assumed your lot's antics would have secured you the love of the masses."
Shadowheart,Seems hard to imagine your efforts haven't always been appreciated.
Shadowheart,"Time shall tell. At the very least, I can learn from her mistakes."
Shadowheart,"... but who knows. Perhaps someone else made her that way, as she tried to do to me."
Shadowheart,"A bold statement, if not an accurate one. Leave me be."
Shadowheart,Now why would you ask me a question like that?
Shadowheart,"Oh stop, you can hardly be that miserable if you have energy for flirting."
Shadowheart,"Take this slain foe as a gift, blessed Nightsinger. Usher her into your darkness."
Shadowheart,"Whatever comes, I'm ready."
Shadowheart,My faith protects me.<br>
Shadowheart,Darkness guide me.
Shadowheart,Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Shadowheart,But imagine what we might achieve if we channelled some of that hostility back at our real foes instead of each other. They wouldn't stand a chance.
Shadowheart,It's already done.
Shadowheart,"You're a child at heart, Gale, admiring wind-up toys and clockwork trinkets."
Shadowheart,"That's ironic, coming from you."
Shadowheart,There is work to do.
Shadowheart,Hmm. I was wondering why you always smelled like a wealthy dowager.
Shadowheart,Silence can be best. Give it a try sometime.
Shadowheart,Its inhabitants and cultures? Maybe. Its fungi and cave slime? No thank you.
Shadowheart,They talk a great deal but do very little. Which may be for the best.
Shadowheart,That's one way of looking at it. You could also say it's a prime target - the one pocket of light in the gloom.
Shadowheart,"Perhaps they should expand their horizons - too much time obsessing over fungi seems to leave a bit... well, like them."
Shadowheart,"You too? Shar take you both, then!"
Shadowheart,I doubt this one's wits will be any sharper by then.
Shadowheart,"Fine. You can accept you're wrong, or we'll be rid of you permanently. Either way, I win."
Shadowheart,Is it that obvious?
Shadowheart,"If anyone asks, I'll say you were transforming. Don't expect to be mourned."
Shadowheart,Can't afford any mistakes.<br>
Shadowheart,I can't afford to fail.
Shadowheart,"She's a liability - it's the artefact we need, not her - "
Shadowheart,"You had better warm to that notion very rapidly, or your journey ends here. We needn't be enemies - there's plenty of those to go around already."
Shadowheart,"Can I do that, Lae'zel? Can I turn my back on you?"
Shadowheart,"Loosen the grip on your pride for one blasted moment, won't you? We needn't be enemies - there's plenty of those to go around already."
Shadowheart,That's an understatement if I ever heard one.
Shadowheart,"I can make some animal noises, if it'll make you feel more at home."
Shadowheart,"Sounds like jealousy, to me. I couldn't risk your wild side getting too excited at the scent of blood..."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar demanded an offering, and I provided. Are you truly that scandalised, Halsin?"
Shadowheart,I have to survive this.
Shadowheart,"Depends, are you buoyant? I may need a life preserver if I get in over my head."
Shadowheart,Stuck. Hold on.<br>
Shadowheart,Can't leave you stuck.<br>
Shadowheart,I'll get you free.<br>
Shadowheart,Can't leave anyone stuck.<br>
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, I'm coming.<br>"
Shadowheart,Secrecy above all.
Shadowheart,"Cloak and dagger, my favourite."
Shadowheart,Can't afford to stay idle.<br><br>
Shadowheart,You've been in better shape.
Shadowheart,"Yes, you could have. Don't pretend otherwise."
Shadowheart,Some prayers are answered more quickly than others. Let's continue.
Shadowheart,Produce the artefact.
Shadowheart,"It's all right, I'll help."
Shadowheart,I've met venomous snakes I'd be faster to trust. Are you sure about this?
Shadowheart,"Hold tight, I'm coming.<br>"
Shadowheart,Won't leave you stuck.<br>
Shadowheart,"Let's talk, then."
Shadowheart,Time for a conversation.
Shadowheart,Could you not stare so blatantly at my neck when you say that please?
Shadowheart,I'll help.<br><br>
Shadowheart,It's nothing. A lucky keepsake I found in some ruins.
Shadowheart,Time for a quick talk.
Shadowheart,"You've been misinformed. By who, I wonder?"
Shadowheart,"Let's chat, then."
Shadowheart,"So. Can you let the matter drop, or should I put you back to sleep permanently?"
Shadowheart,Nobody I'd rather whisper to more.<br>
Shadowheart,The pleasure's all mine.
Shadowheart,If I knew you weren't a threat to me - to my mission - then perhaps we could make peace.
Shadowheart,Something needs to be said.
Shadowheart,Exciting.<br>
Shadowheart,I'll fetch you.<br>
Shadowheart,Can't leave a friend stuck.<br>
Shadowheart,There's no time to waste.<br>
Shadowheart,I'm ready. Whatever it takes.
Shadowheart,Spare her.
Shadowheart,What am I to do?
Shadowheart,Let's get on with it.<br>
Shadowheart,End her words with the Spear of Night.
Shadowheart,A long way to go still.<br>
Shadowheart,Can't leave an ally trapped.
Shadowheart,No time to dally.<br>
Shadowheart,Not a dagger - a spear. My Lady Shar's spear.
Shadowheart,Might as well help myself.<br>
Shadowheart,It is my Lady Shar's will. You should be honoured to be a part of her plan - I know I am.
Shadowheart,Her fate is mine to seal. Let me handle this.
Shadowheart,Let's see what's on offer.
Shadowheart,No harm in taking a peek.
Shadowheart,"Hold tight, I'll help."
Shadowheart,You must die. Shar wills it.
Shadowheart,I don't need much excuse.
Shadowheart,Anything to hear that voice.<br>
Shadowheart,Wounds in need of closing.
Shadowheart,I... what do you think? What should I do?
Shadowheart,What did you say...?
Shadowheart,"If I have to step over your corpse to fulfil what Lady Shar asks of me, so be it. Your choice."
Shadowheart,I can't believe I did that - Shar will disown me. Now I'm truly lost...
Shadowheart,"If you knew me, you would not even ask. It is what my Lady wants - I'm just her servant."
Shadowheart,"Of course, why wouldn't it be? This is my purpose."
Shadowheart,"I... yes, I think so. My whole life's been leading to this. No turning back now."
Shadowheart,I... I can't believe I just did that. Lady Shar will disown me... what will happen to me?
Shadowheart,"Persistent, aren't you? Under different circumstances, I'm sure we'd get on quite well."
Shadowheart,"Good. This little venture would be duller without you, I'll admit."
Shadowheart,I still could. Then no more Lae'zel to pry into my affairs...
Shadowheart,Do your worst. I won't tell you anything.
Shadowheart,Offer her a half-truth. Say you found it on a dead gith.
Shadowheart,"Wait. You held a blade to my throat over this, and now you don't care?"
Shadowheart,Keep quiet.
Shadowheart,Attack .
Shadowheart,"My, quite charming when you want to be, aren't you? Maybe save some for the next time we have to talk our way past a sentry or the like."
Shadowheart,"Whatever you think you know of me won't matter, once I become whom I'm meant to be."
Shadowheart,"I didn't want to fight. I wanted you to see reason. A foolish notion, clearly."
Shadowheart,Cannot allow...? This is my mistress' will - my life's purpose!
Shadowheart,Will be on the mend soon.
Shadowheart,You need to get out of here. Back away.
Shadowheart,I'll kill you if necessary. But explaining your corpse would be a chore.
Shadowheart,Retrieve the artefact.
Shadowheart,You would be wise to forget me. I can only hope I one day forget you.
Shadowheart,You know your choices.
Shadowheart,"I did, once. More fool me."
Shadowheart,They are more than welcome to try.
Shadowheart,"But if that comes into doubt, I'll kill you. Sleep well."
Shadowheart,There is no 'we'. Not anymore.
Shadowheart,I can no longer suffer your company. Be grateful I don't rid myself of it with a blade.
Shadowheart,"But if you break your promise, I'll kill you. Sleep well."
Shadowheart,"Hmm. You seem sincere, oddly enough. Let's say we have an understanding."
Shadowheart,"I had a choice to make, in the heart of Lady Shar's domain. But you denied me that chance. Now my future is gone - nothing but windblown ashes and wasted potential."
Shadowheart,You finally showed yourself - I thought you might try and avoid me.
Shadowheart,There. Is that worth your life?
Shadowheart,I've... I've failed. Lady Shar will disown me... what will happen to me?
Shadowheart,What's next?<br>
Shadowheart,Can't afford to stay idle.<br>
Shadowheart,Who are you?
Shadowheart,"I'm not here to answer to you, or anyone else. I'm here for my parents."
Shadowheart,I suppose that's the subtle approach dispensed with.
Shadowheart,"I have... strayed, it is true. But I have returned to make amends. I will put my fate in the Mother Superior's hands, and trust that Lady Shar will guide her."
Shadowheart,Need to keep focused.
Shadowheart,An ally in need.<br>
Shadowheart,Help's coming.
Shadowheart,I'm coming for you.
Shadowheart,Stuck? Really?
Shadowheart,"I know the truth. I know my parents still live. Tell me where they are, and I have no quarrel with you."
Shadowheart,Worse than a bloody child.
Shadowheart,"Come on, get a grip."
Shadowheart,Won't leave you behind.
Shadowheart,My faith will guide me.
Shadowheart,"Wits and blades, always sharp."
Shadowheart,I wonder what the next move is.<br>
Shadowheart,"Whatever comes, I'm ready.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Of course not. A cover, to throw our enemies of the scent. I suppose you weren't deemed important enough to be informed of the plan."
Shadowheart,"Fine, I'll help.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Yes, I trust him. Whatever you have to say, say it."
Shadowheart,"Yes, I trust her. Whatever you have to say, say it."
Shadowheart,"What's next, I wonder?<br>"
Shadowheart,You're not angry?
Shadowheart,Tuck the relic away and turn to leave.
Shadowheart,Confess everything you know.
Shadowheart,Refuse.
Shadowheart,"Please, don't remind me. But keep your guard up with her."
Shadowheart,"Understandable, when the answer is invariably 'the silver-haired one ate them'."
Shadowheart,Never visited before? I thought you got around.
Shadowheart,"Not the vilest any of us have seen of late, unfortunately."
Shadowheart,"Given your own nature, are you really the one to judge?"
Shadowheart,"Mother Superior sent you? Go on, then - where do I go?"
Shadowheart,"Tell me one thing... Is there someone called Rennald there? A tiefling boy, or possibly a man now."
Shadowheart,"Yes, I trust them. Whatever you have to say, say it."
Shadowheart,There's something I need to do once we enter the Dark Lady's domain. Any more meddling on your part will end badly.
Shadowheart,There's something I need to do once we enter the Dark Lady's domain. Just don't interfere - it's important.
Shadowheart,"There is something I need, before we continue - the Spear of Night. We can find it in the Library."
Shadowheart,I need to concentrate.
Shadowheart,The mission has to come first.
Shadowheart,"Isn't that how you feel all the time, Astarion? I thought you'd find it comforting."
Shadowheart,It's my prize. I'll die to protect it.
Shadowheart,"I'm probably more at home in the water than you now, Astarion."
Shadowheart,"Very kind of you, but I'm saving my best bottle for someone already."
Shadowheart,"Heirloom? Plunder from some conquered realm, more like. This artefact is the only thing keeping us from becoming slaves to our parasites. Be glad I have it."
Shadowheart,"She is deluded - as are you, should you show her your allegiance."
Shadowheart,"Lae'zel thinks I have something important to her people. She's deluded, clearly."
Shadowheart,Nonsense. You're just finally showing what you really are - a reaver to the bone.
Shadowheart,Nonsense. You're just finally showing us what you really are - a reaver to the bone.
Shadowheart,"Do you hear this tripe? Our lives are at stake, and she wants us to turn on each other."
Shadowheart,"You hear that, Lae'zel? It's called common sense."
Shadowheart,I heard you mumbling that line to yourself earlier - it needs more work.
Shadowheart,"Get some rest, Lae'zel - you'll need it."
Shadowheart,I can't.
Shadowheart,Tell me one thing... Is there someone called Rennald there? A tiefling with short horns and purple hair.
Shadowheart,"I can't tell what I don't know. Shar willed it, so I obeyed."
Shadowheart,"I can't tell what I don't know. My goddess willed it, so I obeyed.<br>"
Shadowheart,Many of us were sent to take it from your kin. I'm the last one left.
Shadowheart,"I don't know what it is, what it does... I just have to get it to Baldur's Gate."
Shadowheart,The Mother Superior sent you?
Shadowheart,"I should have seen this coming, coward."
Shadowheart,Admit it - you're just glad to see some potential meals walking about after all those bloodless shadows.
Shadowheart,Shar forsakes everyone in the end. Her embrace is a lie.
Shadowheart,"I have... strayed, it is true. But I have come to make amends, and face judgement."
Shadowheart,Lady Shar. She came to me as I prayed. She told me what needs to be done.
Shadowheart,"All right, no need to dash in ahead of me - I'm ready."
Shadowheart,"Nothing, just a show of respect. Trust me, you wouldn't want to displease her. Not here. Let's continue."
Shadowheart,What did you just say...?
Shadowheart,I'm not here to submit. I'm here to cleanse Lady Shar's ranks. She decreed it.
Shadowheart,You're talking about the cloister? Point the way.
Shadowheart,Tell me... is there someone called Rennald there? A tiefling with short horns and purple hair.
Shadowheart,I'll make my way there.
Shadowheart,Do vampires actually usually drink blood out of goblets like in the storybooks? Doesn't seem very fresh. 
Shadowheart,What can I expect once I'm admitted?
Shadowheart,You are an enemy to the Lady of Loss. Nothing else matters.
Shadowheart,"If I spare you, you'll tell me what you know?"
Shadowheart,Can't you show me yourself?
Shadowheart,No. Perhaps you've mistaken me for somebody else?
Shadowheart,Maybe so. Where is it you think I'm expected?
Shadowheart,You're welcome?
Shadowheart,"If that was supposed to be a pick-up line, I think it needs more work."
Shadowheart,"Living without sunlight isn't so bad, Astarion. Where I came from, we would often work exclusively under cover of darkness."
Shadowheart,The nomad's life has its charms. You get to meet such interesting people - and sometimes they don't even try to kill you.
Shadowheart,"You're hardly in a position to stop me, given how weak you are."
Shadowheart,"I've told you all I'm going to tell you. Now please don't pry any further, or you might force me to become less polite."
Shadowheart,"This place is like some moist, unappealing maze. Can your nose guide us, Halsin?"
Shadowheart,Only jesting. I'm sure you're a force to be reckoned with.
Shadowheart,Only jesting. I know all too well what it's like to pine after a goddess...
Shadowheart,Only jesting. I'm in no position to judge - especially after what happened with Shar.
Shadowheart,'She just lives on another plane.'
Shadowheart,I'm surprised she still listens to you.
Shadowheart,"Isn't it so, that every time you speak as you cast a spell, you're endeavouring to call upon Mystra?"
Shadowheart,What good would it do for me to be troubled? We can't save them all.
Shadowheart,"Cloaca...? You could have just said tunnels, you know. I'm nauseous enough as it is."
Shadowheart,Fun? Well... yes. I suppose we did manage to make the best of things.
Shadowheart,"I don't know... the anger was simple. I understood it, found comfort in it. Now I don't know what to believe."
Shadowheart,"A Selûnite shrine. It would've made my blood boil, once, just to look upon this..."
Shadowheart,I'll leave the kinder words to the softer hearts.
Shadowheart,"A humble specimen, aren't you?"
Shadowheart,"You seem to know a good deal about our condition, Gale."
Shadowheart,Remind me to not attend any poetry recitals with you.
Shadowheart,"Not too downmarket of an establishment for you I hope, Gale?"
Shadowheart,The same... except for a knot of worry in my stomach that's in no rush to go away.
Shadowheart,"The end must be near. No regrets, Gale? You may have been better off staying inside that boulder..."
Shadowheart,Still no symptoms?
Shadowheart,"So this is where you interred Ketheric Thorm, Halsin? Couldn't you have done a little more to prevent his return...?"
Shadowheart,"Odd that you're fighting Ketheric Thorm again, only this time with a warrior of Lady Shar at your side."
Shadowheart,"Moonrise Towers. There used to be more than one tower, of course. The other must have been destroyed."
Shadowheart,"I think the thin air might be getting to you, Karlach."
Shadowheart,"No, I mean more like vices. You know - pleasures of the flesh."
Shadowheart,A remote spot for a monastery. I suppose they wanted to make sure the monks avoided temptation.
Shadowheart,"Oh hush, you. Stop fishing for compliments."
Shadowheart,"Oh. Well I meant more the molten rock and plunging chasms, but yes, the folk leave something to be desired as well."
Shadowheart,This place is hard to bear. I hope we're able to continue on our way before too long.
Shadowheart,I like your way of thinking. Split any takings we find?
Shadowheart,All I'm saying is that it's more difficult to come back from the dead if you were chopped up and had the pieces delivered to different corners of the realm.
Shadowheart,"The whole village is falling to pieces. These goblins aren't exactly house-proud, as occupiers go..."
Shadowheart,Halsin... were there ever wolves in these woods?
Shadowheart,Is that so? It's quite a hand...
Shadowheart,"Chin up, Halsin. I know you don't favour Lady Shar's darkness, but look - trees!"
Shadowheart,"I'd hoped for something a bit more exotic... but would you carry around my fish bowl, feed me flakes of food?"
Shadowheart,"Halsin, if I were a druid, what animal do you think I'd be?"
Shadowheart,"Hardly - he's merely one more obstacle - and a killable one, now that Nightsong is free."
Shadowheart,"Second time's a charm, eh, Halsin? Let's make sure Ketheric Thorm is gone for good this time."
Shadowheart,"Indeed. 'Shadowheart and Halsin, Sharran and Bear. Who would have dreamt of an alliance so rare'."
Shadowheart,"I see... a hundred years is too far back, for what I had in mind. No matter."
Shadowheart,"Not at all. Nice to be on the receiving end, now and again. Keeps me sharp."
Shadowheart,"So. A vampire spawn and a monster hunter in the same group. We're not going to have trouble, are we?"
Shadowheart,I'm sure you would. Don't sound so eager.
Shadowheart,"I don't suppose you really have much use for gold, do you, Astarion?"
Shadowheart,"So, Astarion. Vampire dens - what should I expect?"
Shadowheart,"You wouldn't actually feed in the wake of a battle, would you? You're not a vulture."
Shadowheart,"Imagine what this place was like, on the day of the battle. The ground must have been covered with the dead..."
Shadowheart,"Back on your feet, friend."
Shadowheart,No time for injuries.
Shadowheart,"Sunlight giving you a headache? You're not supposed to stare right into it, you know."
Shadowheart,"Baldur's Gate prices, though. Not worth it, if you ask me."
Shadowheart,"Go on then, coyness isn't in your nature. What would you do with unlimited funds?"
Shadowheart,I'm not quite sure I like where this is going.
Shadowheart,I would have said I admire fungi as well. 
Shadowheart,I can think of a least one wriggly stowaway who might dispute that...
Shadowheart,"Careful, Minthara. As a drow exile, you could be classed as a refugee yourself. Not volunteering, I take it?"
Shadowheart,Partly why the Ducal Council controls supply - trying to keep the whizz-bangs out of nefarious hands.
Shadowheart,"Plenty. They can make for excellent distractions, should you need to make a quick exit."
Shadowheart,This'll dampen the pain.
Shadowheart,Need everyone alive and fighting.
Shadowheart,"You're wounded, friend."
Shadowheart,Until I met such a thing you call a Myconid.
Shadowheart,I've got your back.
Shadowheart,Such depth to the shadows... I don't care what others say about the Underdark - it's beautiful down here.
Shadowheart,You know what I really miss about Baldur's Gate? The food. Freshest fish I've ever had.
Shadowheart,Hmm... interesting.
Shadowheart,"So, Astarion. Which of us would you rather feed on? If you had free rein?"
Shadowheart,"Come on, you know I'm talking about their blood."
Shadowheart,"I have to ask, Astarion. Do people taste different from one another, when you feed?"
Shadowheart,You must be eager to get back then. Slimmer pickings out in this wilderness.
Shadowheart,This is what I get for trying to strike up conversation.
Shadowheart,"Do you have someone waiting for you in Baldur's Gate, Astarion? A sweetheart perhaps?"
Shadowheart,"Ugh, I hate swamps. The place reeks - probably full of bloodsuckers as well."
Shadowheart,"Thank you, sister. I'll remember your help, if I succeed. As will my Lady."
Shadowheart,"You're uncharacteristically quiet, Astarion. Awed into silence?"
Shadowheart,Most of the things you say still sound like you're in a two-copper paperback read by little girls.
Shadowheart,"I can't quite believe you've been a pick-up artist all these years, Astarion."
Shadowheart,You've clearly thought this through a great deal. I'm impressed and appalled in equal measure.
Shadowheart,"Well, so are you, but we keep you around, don't we?"
Shadowheart,"I didn't exactly dress for hiking mountains. Shame we couldn't procure some pack mules, or horses."
Shadowheart,"Really? Even with all these chambers, and the commanding views? You could live like a lord."
Shadowheart,"This must have been quite a place, in its heyday. Could you ever picture yourself living here, Astarion? You know, assuming the riff-raff were cleared out?"
Shadowheart,Well unless we find a cure you won't have any teeth to chew it with soon enough.
Shadowheart,This hungry look in their eyes... The haunted complexion... What could it mean?
Shadowheart,Let me see your wounds.
Shadowheart,"I love a nice secret hideaway, don't you?"
Shadowheart,We've had some close calls already. There could be even tougher days ahead...
Shadowheart,"Sobering, to think that we've got even tougher battles yet to come."
Shadowheart,"What's to be said, I wonder?"
Shadowheart,I suppose it might be nice to be remembered - though I'd be less keen on having birds perching on my head for evermore.
Shadowheart,"All this stonework has me thinking - would you ever want a statue of yourself, Wyll?"
Shadowheart,"Stuck, eh? Hold on.<br>"
Shadowheart,Better lend a hand.<br>
Shadowheart,They always disappoint though.
Shadowheart,I've always had a soft spot for the confident ones...
Shadowheart,No harm in talking.
Shadowheart,"Have you wondered what people will say, Wyll? When they find out the monster hunter is becoming a monster."
Shadowheart,I hope you don't mind if I don't ask to see it.
Shadowheart,"So Wyll, what was the Blade of Frontiers' toughest kill?"
Shadowheart,Stuck fast. I'll help.<br>
Shadowheart,Can't leave anyone stuck.
Shadowheart,"How do they differ, then? The number of horns? The exact timbre of their evil laugh?"
Shadowheart,"Fiend worship... I'm not trying to pick a fight, Wyll. But it really seems like a blatantly ill-advised idea."
Shadowheart,I won't leave you behind.
Shadowheart,"Hold tight, I'll get you.<br>"
Shadowheart,In a bind? I'll help.
Shadowheart,Heh. 'Pleasure dome'.
Shadowheart,I'd better strike up a conversation.
Shadowheart,"Really? I'm surprised. I thought dowries, alliances and old blueblood feuds might have to be balanced against your desires."
Shadowheart,Seems like you truly know the city. I never got to explore it to my liking.
Shadowheart,"Oh, I'm aware. Several come to mind right now... but I'm going to tempt fate and say we can take our time."
Shadowheart,"Oh, no. I provided the refreshments. You can supply the entertainment."
Shadowheart,I know. One of my many fine qualities.
Shadowheart,"You... All right, then. More the fool me."
Shadowheart,"Heh. Not worried, are you? Rest easy."
Shadowheart,To not being poisoned - how about that?
Shadowheart,"Not one for taking things slowly, I see."
Shadowheart,"Someone of your... social stature, Wyll. Are they typically allowed to pursue their heart's whims as they like?"
Shadowheart,To insatiable urges.
Shadowheart,Someone's enthusiastic. Maybe I should have brought a barrel.
Shadowheart,I was hoping for a toast. Any suggestions?
Shadowheart,A gallows? Nooses are for amateurs - that's what I was taught in the Grotto. Do you know how badly those things can go wrong?
Shadowheart,Focus. Strike true.<br>
Shadowheart,But why?
Shadowheart,So. Wyll with a 'y' - why?
Shadowheart,"A quick talk, then."
Shadowheart,No harm in a discreet chat.
Shadowheart,Lots of people make promises. Few keep them.
Shadowheart,"You can just fill it with supplies, seal up the hidden entrance, and tuck yourself away from the world..."
Shadowheart,Why must the Dead Three be so obvious and ugly with their decor? Blood and bones. Bones and blood. Pointy nonsense. At least Shar had some panache.
Shadowheart,"You know what would be nice, just for a change? Venturing through a mysterious bazaar, or a lush, dark wood, scented with lavender."
Shadowheart,"That's enough, I get the picture. Gods, do I get the picture..."
Shadowheart,"I wouldn't have predicted the night you shared with our friend, Lae'zel. You didn't consider it beneath you?"
Shadowheart,"I'll be keeping an eye on you, understand?"
Shadowheart,It's a metaphor.
Shadowheart,"So. Have we buried the hatchet, Lae'zel?"
Shadowheart,I'd rather an extra burden than extra enemies. Anyone the Absolute has captive is one tadpole away from taking up arms against us.
Shadowheart,"A hindrance, you say? Remind me, where did we fetch you from again? Oh that's right - a cage, caught by a couple of tieflings. Interesting."
Shadowheart,All those locked cells. A girl could cause all sorts of mischief with skilled fingers and a hairpin...
Shadowheart,"I'm a tad surprised you change into more comfortable garb at camp, Lae'zel. You strike me as a 'sleeps in her armour' type."
Shadowheart,Hmm. Good to know.
Shadowheart,"Lae'zel, how would you punish someone who wronged you?"
Shadowheart,They pursued the nautiloid. Perhaps they were trying to free you.
Shadowheart,"Do you think your kin search for you, Lae'zel?"
Shadowheart,"So, gith. Aren't you worried your kind will punish you for consorting with us?"
Shadowheart,If you say so. Just don't expect me to put all my eggs in the same basket.
Shadowheart,"What if this crèche doesn't work out, Lae'zel? What if your kin fail you?"
Shadowheart,"'Shadowheart' will do just fine, thanks. Love is making you fanciful."
Shadowheart,"Meaning things will start becoming easier for us, or our situation will deteriorate from here...?"
Shadowheart,"Oh, say, murder. Or theft."
Shadowheart,They have their purpose. I'd just rather we didn't have to wade through their purpose.
Shadowheart,"Nighttime exertions...? Oh, I see. Well, considerate of you, I suppose."
Shadowheart,"Baldur's Gate can be dirty, overcrowded, dangerous... but I do like it all the same. Found anything to admire in it, Lae'zel?"
Shadowheart,"You know what would be nice, just for a change? Venturing through a sun-dappled vineyard, or a gleaming palace. "
Shadowheart,Hold on.<br>
Shadowheart,"Oh yes, I forgot - you had your love of the Absolute to mask the ugly parts."
Shadowheart,Ugh. This place brings back unwelcome memories of a tadpole slipping behind my eye...
Shadowheart,...Of course.
Shadowheart,"Is drow society as the books say? It almost sounds tempting - matriarchal power, flourishing to its greatest extent."
Shadowheart,"Any doubts about falling for a foe, Minthara? Or does that just add spice to things?"
Shadowheart,Not my kin - not any longer. Their past deeds are not my responsibility.
Shadowheart,"I am fond of Baldur's Gate, in spite of it's failings. It's the perfect place for Lady Shar's faith to take hold. "
Shadowheart,Even those devoted to loss fill their pockets and bellies when the chance arises.
Shadowheart,"Worse - they defied Lady Shar's power, openly. Now they have paid the price."
Shadowheart,Gone. Swallowed up by the shadow curse.
Shadowheart, Am I evil? You called my goddess so. 
Shadowheart," Hey Minsc, How do you judge what's evil? "
Shadowheart, The dark is Shar's domain. You wouldn't have been lonely if you embraced her. 
Shadowheart," Hey Minsc, what was it like, being a statue? "
Shadowheart,"Careful Lae'zel, it's dark around here. Would be a terrible shame to lose you forever."
Shadowheart,"How about you, Lae'zel? You're new to the city - found anything to admire in it?"
Shadowheart,They were desperate. Nobody deserves this.
Shadowheart,Good. Now I believe I was asking you how you were this evening?
Shadowheart,We need everyone alive.
Shadowheart,I suppose you're right. On both counts.
Shadowheart,I thought that was lost in the Shadowfell. How do you have it?
Shadowheart,I just want to remember what I lost.
Shadowheart,I'm going to make them pay for what they did to me.
Shadowheart,I just want to move on with my life.
Shadowheart,I... I don't know what to say. I don't know these people.
Shadowheart,"That was a Selûnite ritual, wasn't it? So that means..."
Shadowheart,"Whatever you have to say, just say it."
Shadowheart,Are you sure it's not the flowers you're smelling? You may be allergic.
Shadowheart,Accept the Spear silently.
Shadowheart,"Same. I think I may have overdone it with the black and purple for, oh, my entire life? Your look serves you well though. "
Shadowheart,The whispers won't let me sleep. They keep pushing me - to you.
Shadowheart,But if you're dead... maybe it'll go away.
Shadowheart,"You're here. Just like it told me you'd be, gith."
Shadowheart,It took me so long to find you. 
Shadowheart,The whispering won't let me sleep. It keeps pushing me - to you.
Shadowheart,"Even when I'm awake, I dream. There's blood, there's so much blood."
Shadowheart,I can't sleep. The whispering won't let me. It keeps pushing me - to you.
Shadowheart,They've been in my head ever since... it doesn't matter. They brought me here.
Shadowheart,You're here. Just like it told me.
Shadowheart,I keep thinking about the knife going deep. It's the only thing they want me to see.
Shadowheart,It seems we're even.
Shadowheart,This is not the time for symbolic gestures. You must stay focused.
Shadowheart,What... who was that man?
Shadowheart,My father? That was him?
Shadowheart,"No, it can't be. I'm an orphan."
Shadowheart,My parents. I need to save them.
Shadowheart,"First Selûne's blessing, and now her gifts. If only the old me could see this..."
Shadowheart,"I'll need every advantage, it seems... Thank you."
Shadowheart,The Spear. How do you have it? I threw it into the Shadowfell.
Shadowheart,You claimed to know something about me - you knew about the wolves. Tell me everything.
Shadowheart,Perhaps I was foolish to spare you. It may have been better to remain ignorant.
Shadowheart,My heritage? What are you talking about?
Shadowheart,Perhaps it was just a mistake. A moment of madness.
Shadowheart,I think you might be right.
Shadowheart,How do I know this isn't some trick? You could have tampered with my memories.
Shadowheart,That can't be. I'm an orphan.
Shadowheart,I have to find my parents.
Shadowheart,Shar's weapon? Surely it's useless now.
Shadowheart,There must be more you can tell me.
Shadowheart,You still wear your hair like that of a novice. You should change it.
Shadowheart,That can't be. I was always loyal to Shar.
Shadowheart,Get to the point.
Shadowheart,And I think they'll stop once I deal with you.
Shadowheart,"The whispering's already quieter here. Once you're dead, it'll be gone entirely."
Shadowheart,"You can really appreciate the darkness out here in the wilds. Not like in the city, where they keep lamps burning all hours. It's not natural."
Shadowheart,"Quite right. On that note, I think I'd like some time alone, if you don't mind. To meditate. We'll talk soon."
Shadowheart,"To some, perhaps. But I'll enjoy the dark while I can. Alone, if you don't mind."
Shadowheart,"You deserve honesty more than most... but please, don't ask."
Shadowheart,"I can't promise that'll be any time soon, but thank you, all the same. "
Shadowheart,I'm sorry. I can't give you that. Not right now.
Shadowheart,"That's not for you to decide. There's a world beyond us. I'd like to be alone now, please."
Shadowheart,I'd like some time alone now. We'll talk soon.
Shadowheart,"To you, perhaps. For me, it's perfect. I think I'll enjoy it by myself for a while, if you don't mind."
Shadowheart,"I wish that was true. But I've seen plenty of blood spilled for just those kinds of things. The world will keep on scheming, no matter what happens to us."
Shadowheart,I do. But I won't. I can't.
Shadowheart,"It won't. But I prefer it to just being frightened. I'd like to be alone now, please."
Shadowheart,Thank you. We can talk again soon.
Shadowheart,I felt that - are you really surprised I won't open up when you keep trying to fumble in my head? Leave me alone.
Shadowheart,I felt that - are you really surprised I won't open up when you try to fumble in my head? Leave me alone.
Shadowheart,"It's nothing, trust me. Beautiful evening, isn't it?"
Shadowheart,"Never mind. Private matter, that's all."
Shadowheart,"Now, how're you faring this evening?"
Shadowheart,I do. But I won't. Not yet.
Shadowheart,I can't see anything else! I can't shake it.
Shadowheart,"You can really appreciate the quiet here. Not like in the city, where noise and life scarcely ever falls silent. It's not natural."
Shadowheart,Nothing. What is this thing?
Shadowheart,What else do I do? My head is splitting open. I can't leave. I can't!
Shadowheart,You can certainly try.
Shadowheart,Rest where? I can't leave. The whispers won't let me leave.
Shadowheart,Stay. I can stay.
Shadowheart,It's a little quieter now. Is that what they wanted?
Shadowheart,"Oh, you've risked plenty."
Shadowheart,No. Enough talk. Enough voices.
Shadowheart,Then how do I make them stop? What do I do?
Shadowheart,"It's nothing, trust me. Interesting choice of camp we have here, isn't it? Peaceful."
Shadowheart,I don't want explanations. I want sleep.
Shadowheart,Don't look at me like that. I can't... no.
Shadowheart,Say what you have to say.
Shadowheart,Maybe you're right. But the whispers won't stop.
Shadowheart,It's not? What are these voices doing to me?
Shadowheart,Now... now what do I do?
Shadowheart,There we go. Clean and deep.
Shadowheart,Bleed for me.
Shadowheart,You're here. Just like it told me. And with a gith - I should have figured.
Shadowheart,No. I'm where I need to be.
Shadowheart,"Oh, he's far too precious for that. I'll go find a comely barmaid or guardsman instead."
Shadowheart,I chose to do that. For the mission. To protect Shar's -
Shadowheart,"What do you know about me? You spoke of my past, being chased by wolves - I told no one about that..."
Shadowheart,An adventurer's got to eat. What do I gain from denying your appetites?
Shadowheart,Don't apologise. I'd rather see you happy than guilty.
Shadowheart,Just don't forget about me either - I have needs of my own.
Shadowheart,I'm not seeking to control you. All I ask is a little... consideration.
Shadowheart,"That said, you can certainly do better then her. I should know."
Shadowheart,Spare me the scolded puppy routine - I already said I'm not angry. I'll still pet you as much as you like.
Shadowheart,"Kind of you to offer a free sample then. Now that he's tried out inferior goods, he'll know just how good he has it already."
Shadowheart,"Kind of you to offer a free sample then. Now that she's tried out inferior goods, she'll know just how good she has it already."
Shadowheart,A girl's got to eat. What do I gain from denying your appetites?
Shadowheart,"Kind of you to offer a free sample then. Now that they've tried out inferior goods, they'll know just how good they has it already."
Shadowheart,Some act as though displaying bare flesh is a more heinous crime than murder and robbery.
Shadowheart,"I'm not inclined to bother, myself, but I suppose it keeps the City Watch at bay."
Shadowheart,I haven't the faintest idea what you mean. Perhaps a cat pounced on its prey?
Shadowheart,Lady Shar permits me to plead ignorance.
Shadowheart,"Quite the gossip, aren't you? Wouldn't have thought you cared."
Shadowheart,Maybe. If you keep a respectable distance.
Shadowheart,"Now that you mention it, I can't remember who taught me. Another memory lost, perhaps."
Shadowheart,"I'd rather not turn my back on you, if it's all the same."
Shadowheart,Nothing. I assume your kin are just as misguided as you are.
Shadowheart,My skills were just fine to begin with. You can save the compliments.
Shadowheart,"You've got to eat, after all. What do I gain from denying your appetites?"
Shadowheart,"The way I was raised, the way I was trained... well, it was positively encouraged, to get to know each other. Even from the memories I can recall, there's stories I could tell you..."
Shadowheart,This'll help with the pain.
Shadowheart,You're in rough shape.
Shadowheart,Can't afford casualties now.
Shadowheart,Cast all wounds into darkness.
Shadowheart,May pain be forgotten.
Shadowheart,Mend all that is broken.
Shadowheart,Wounds begone.
Shadowheart,Let the pain fade.
Shadowheart,"All that said, there's no harm in asking me in advance."
Shadowheart,Time to undo the damage.
Shadowheart,Healing's on the way.
Shadowheart,Injuries begone.
Shadowheart,I can tend to this.
Shadowheart,I'll fix that.
Shadowheart,"Pleasant evening, I trust? I tidied up my hair and had an early night... but you don't look like you had much sleep at all."
Shadowheart,"I'm not jealous, you know. If I wanted to bed something loyal and pure, I'd find a swan."
Shadowheart,Is that so? Clearly I've been going too easy on you...
Shadowheart,"You were offered a chance, and you seized it with both hands - and some other parts besides. It's admirable, really."
Shadowheart,A little soothing's in order.
Shadowheart,...Almost no one. But I certainly didn't share that with you.
Shadowheart,"More a sign of the times, I suppose."
Shadowheart,"Touché, Lae'zel! Perhaps wits are contagious. "
Shadowheart,It's called an embrace. I suppose you don't receive many.
Shadowheart,"Any restriction, any tether must be shed. Surely you understand that? It is a form of freedom, if a tragic one."
Shadowheart,Sorry. I'm being silly.
Shadowheart,"They remind me of some place - a place I can't quite remember. But I think I was happy there, wherever it was."
Shadowheart,"Well, isn't it enough that they're beautiful?"
Shadowheart,It must be all the fresh air since the crash - has me flush.
Shadowheart,You must be imagining it.
Shadowheart,"It's a deal, so long as you watch my back."
Shadowheart,Sounds pleasant to swim with you. At a distance. It's usually so freezing.
Shadowheart,"Actually... I've been stripped of that particular advantage. But I will forge ahead, nonetheless."
Shadowheart,More like soon-to-be tadpole residences. Every infected prisoner will just make things harder on us...
Shadowheart,Nothing wrong with a nice subdued ambience. It can help flatter even the homeliest of faces.
Shadowheart,"Simplicity is the key to a good deception. If in doubt, try thinking less."
Shadowheart,"Just an insect - I'm sure you'll survive. Besides, it probably figured you for a tasty treat."
Shadowheart,"Nothing in my recollection, anyway..."
Shadowheart,I was raised in the city - I'm more used to feeling cobblestones underfoot than grass and fallen leaves.
Shadowheart,"Oh I'm more than aware, trust me. I've had plenty of training in what to expect from them."
Shadowheart,"But better safe than sorry, I suppose."
Shadowheart,That's either profoundly poetic or childishly simple. I'm going with poetic.
Shadowheart,"Just to be clear - you're going to lead us into a nest of githyanki marauders, and we're supposed to trust that will end well for us?"
Shadowheart,"It shouldn't surprise you. We have been at war with Selûne since before most of history was written. An eternal conflict, from the viewpoint of mortals..."
Shadowheart,Need to press onward.
Shadowheart,You're right - though I like to think my wits are the best weapon I have.
Shadowheart,"Easy, Lae'zel - we need answers, yes, but you catch more flies with honey than vinegar..."
Shadowheart,"You're keen. Just don't get carried away - some of those guts might be of more use to us unspilled, at least for a while."
Shadowheart,They were arrogant enough to try and withstand Lady Shar's power. This was always going to be the end result.
Shadowheart,They didn't deserve this.
Shadowheart,Stuck? Why aren't I surprised.
Shadowheart,Sounds vile. I assume the meaning of 'perfect' was lost in translation...
Shadowheart,Stuck? Seriously?<br>
Shadowheart,"Shar's entire creed revolves around waging war against Selûne. Imagine all the generations of mortals, sacrificed in an eternal conflict between sisters."
Shadowheart,Perfectly hidden.
Shadowheart,Unseen. Perfect.
Shadowheart,Darkness cloak me.
Shadowheart,"Calm and quiet, that's the way."
Shadowheart,"Unseen, as I was taught."
Shadowheart,Keep low and quiet.
Shadowheart,Have to keep low.
Shadowheart,Mustn't let anyone see.
Shadowheart,Quiet as a shadow.
Shadowheart,Shar conceals me.
Shadowheart,"Thank you, brother. I'll remember your help, if I succeed. As will my Lady."
Shadowheart,Lady Shar's initiates... we weren't supposed to have relationships. Or flings. Not even stray trysts. And yet... we found a way.
Shadowheart,"Spare me the scepticism - she said it was my special purpose, for my ears alone. You'll see for yourself, soon enough."
Shadowheart,"Do that again, and I'll split your skull, understand?<br>"
Shadowheart,"If I want you to know something, I'll tell you. "
Shadowheart,"Keep this up, and I'm out of here."
Shadowheart,Now leave me alone.
Shadowheart,Hmmm... you'd do well where I'm from. But don't try it again.
Shadowheart,Now go rest. And keep your mind to yourself.
Shadowheart,At least you're honest. Don't do that again.
Shadowheart,Stop! I already warned you not to do that again.
Shadowheart,"I can't trust you, can I?"
Shadowheart,"The sooner we part ways, the better. Until then, keep away from me. "
Shadowheart,I hope not. I'd miss our little conversations... wouldn't you miss them as well?
Shadowheart,...but let's take care of our problem first. Rest well.
Shadowheart,"I'm glad. Hopefully we can eke out some more time together, before all's done and dusted... "
Shadowheart,"Oh. In that case, I won't keep you from your blanket. The time in my company will pass more quickly if you're asleep. Good night."
Shadowheart,I hope so. Good night.
Shadowheart,"I was so close to receiving Lady Shar's embrace, at last. One final test was all that remained - but you ruined that for me."
Shadowheart,I cannot remain with you. Count yourself lucky that I do not just cut you down in the Nightsinger's name.
Shadowheart,I know what you did. My parents - I felt everything they did... as you killed them.
Shadowheart,A beautiful night. Not even a hint of moon to sully Lady Shar's dark sky.
Shadowheart,Allow me to be frank - we can't presume we'll get to share another night like this; there's a battle coming. Not everyone is going to make it.
Shadowheart,"Faith is one thing I have in plentiful supply. In fact, it's what I wanted to talk to you about."
Shadowheart,Not fatalistic - pragmatic. We should do everything we can to tilt the odds in our favour. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Shadowheart,"We should make an offering to Lady Shar, to seek her blessing and protection against what lies ahead. A Nightfall ritual."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar's followers honour her with an act of wickedness, carried out in her name. Then, they feast, knowing they carry the Nightsinger's blessing anew."
Shadowheart,That's not something I'm accused of very often... but I suppose you're right. I'll let you get your rest - good night.
Shadowheart,Help me do this. You will not regret it.
Shadowheart,Heh. A little comfort and company doesn't sound bad...
Shadowheart,"Perhaps something else will come to you, before we part ways. Rest well.<br>"
Shadowheart,"The sooner we find the druid Halsin, the better. I can't wait to get rid of this thing in my head."
Shadowheart,"The sooner we find this 'Priestess Gut', the better. I can't wait to get rid of this thing in my head."
Shadowheart,I can't wait to get this thing out of my head.
Shadowheart,Head to Baldur's Gate. Someone's waiting for me.
Shadowheart,Let a girl have some secrets. Was there anything else?
Shadowheart,"Yes, vastly so. But I don't want to talk about her. Not right now."
Shadowheart,It's a beautiful night. I think I'll stay up to enjoy it while I still can. Rest well.
Shadowheart,We should get some rest. Good night.
Shadowheart,The same. These parasites are proving suspiciously benign.
Shadowheart,But suppose I turn... what would you do?
Shadowheart,Really? I'd just kill you.
Shadowheart,Disappointing.
Shadowheart,"Anyway, get some rest. Try not to dream about tying me up."
Shadowheart,"But you're right - if we're to make it through all this, there can be no room for hesitation. You're doing well. "
Shadowheart,A firm answer. I'd do the same. 
Shadowheart,We'll need that kind of thinking to make it through all this. You're doing well. 
Shadowheart,"It's hardly hypothetical - we're still in danger, after all."
Shadowheart,Hah! And I'd chase you as fast as my tentacles could carry me.
Shadowheart,You're funny.
Shadowheart,I hadn't thought of that. What do you have in mind?
Shadowheart,"Hmmm... Brambles on bare skin aren't as fun in practice, I'm afraid."
Shadowheart,Perhaps we should wait for more comfortable surrounds.
Shadowheart,"Besides, I can't afford to tire you out - we still have work to do. Rest well."
Shadowheart,Adventurous.
Shadowheart,"Wise... though I hope you'd miss me after I'm gone. I think I would, if the positions were reversed."
Shadowheart,"Finally, some good fortune. Come morning, we know what to do."
Shadowheart,"Wait until the others are asleep, then come with me. It might just save your life..."
Shadowheart,We are finished. But that doesn't mean I don't have uses for you... and perhaps you for me.
Shadowheart,"And making a lover wait...? Well, there's few finer torments, if you know what you're doing..."
Shadowheart,"As long as my actions can be thought of as honouring Shar, or honing skills in her service... there is a great deal of flexibility to be had."
Shadowheart,The catch is this: I can't truly love you. Not like most define it. I'll always have to keep a place for Lady Shar.
Shadowheart,"But you're clever, willing, and flexible... you needn't feel left wanting."
Shadowheart,I'll give you all that I can. Just don't call it love.
Shadowheart,I know you do... but I'm not going to let you. Not just yet...
Shadowheart,Few finer torments.
Shadowheart,"Perhaps you do, but let's leave no doubt - I can't truly love you. Not like most define it. I'll always have to keep a place for Lady Shar."
Shadowheart,"Well... let's just say I can play the innocent when needed, have a lighter touch than you might expect, and can untie many knots with just my mouth. Practical skills, learned in service of Lady Shar."
Shadowheart,But you need to understand the limitations. I can't truly love you. Not like most define it. I'll always have to keep a place for Lady Shar.
Shadowheart,Don't you? It might be more interesting than you realise...
Shadowheart,"You can frame many acts as service to the Dark Lady, if you put your mind to it. Seduction can be a worthy form of subterfuge. A snatched moment can practise the art of stealth. "
Shadowheart,"Don't worry. Even if I could remember them, none could withstand comparison to you."
Shadowheart,Imagine how much of a chore I'd be to have around if I truly remembered nothing.
Shadowheart,Good. Then hopefully you'll understand exactly what I mean...
Shadowheart,I don't know what to say... we're already together as much as Lady Shar allows. Is that not enough for you?
Shadowheart,It's only a half-measure if you don't allow yourself to consider it otherwise.
Shadowheart,Pity.
Shadowheart,I can still feel the Shadowfell all over me... still hear her words in my ear. I feel... unclean.
Shadowheart,"You've nothing to be sorry for. Far from it, in fact. Without your help, things could have ended very differently for me."
Shadowheart,"I hope that's true, but I'm not so sure. She has a far reach, and a long memory."
Shadowheart,I want to wash it away. All of it...
Shadowheart,"I have an idea, but I'll need your help."
Shadowheart,"Wait until the others are asleep, then come with me. There's a place we can go, down the coast a little."
Shadowheart,"I remember plenty - just not everything. I might not recall everything from my past, but I know my name. I can still walk and talk. I know words of devotion to Lady Shar and where to strike a leg in order to sever the main artery."
Shadowheart,"We can leave the kneeling and praying to the rest. The Nightsinger prefers a more active form of devotion. An act of wickedness, carried out in her name, followed by a feast."
Shadowheart,"Whatever I said about your kind before, trust I'll never accuse you of being boring."
Shadowheart,"It can be difficult to explain, if you don't worship the Nightsinger yourself... but I'll try."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar demands my heart, and I give it to her freely. But there's more to me than a heart, and I'd like to indulge you. Just this once."
Shadowheart,Do I truly need to explain? You made me who I am. Now I'd like to show you the fruits of your labour.
Shadowheart,Precisely. Care to show your devotion? Just say the word.
Shadowheart,"Your loss then. If you're struck down in the battles to come, remember that you refused Lady Shar's shield."
Shadowheart,"And my... company. But no matter; there's willing flesh elsewhere. Sleep well, if you can."
Shadowheart,I'm glad you feel the same. We should do everything we can to tilt the odds in our favour. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Shadowheart,"This place... these shadows. I don't seem to be affected. Not as badly, anyway."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps I shouldn't put it to the test, but compared to everyone else, I feel fine. Better than fine."
Shadowheart,"Since we arrived in the city, I can't help but feel a little... anxious. But I'm not sure I know why."
Shadowheart,I don't think it's what happens if we fail that concerns me - we'll be beyond our worries at that point. I think what bothers me is what happens if we succeed...
Shadowheart,I've never been able to write my own future. I wouldn't even know where to begin. 
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar respects cunning. And that's exactly what you and I will need to demonstrate, if you want this to continue."
Shadowheart,"I'd like to find somewhere peaceful, with my parents close by. Away from the city, perhaps."
Shadowheart,"I want to grow flowers. I want to be surrounded by colours, every day. I'm tired of darkness."
Shadowheart,"What more could I need? If I had all that, and I had you... that's more of a life that I ever dared to dream of."
Shadowheart,"Yes... I want to share it all with you, if you're willing."
Shadowheart,"Then sounds like I have everything I need - more of life than I'd ever imagined possible, without Shar."
Shadowheart,"I was going to save the best until last, but to put your mind at ease - yes. I want to share everything that lies ahead of me with you. If you're willing, of course."
Shadowheart,"I did... after I was abducted. Perhaps if we survive all of this, a fresh start would be for the best."
Shadowheart,"I'd like to find somewhere peaceful. Somewhere I can feel close to my parents' spirits. Away from the city, perhaps."
Shadowheart,"Well, I want to save my parents, of course. Take them away, far from Shar's influence. Someplace peaceful - away from the city, perhaps."
Shadowheart,"I think I'd like to put Shar behind me, and find somewhere peaceful. Away from the city, perhaps."
Shadowheart,"Thank you. Now I have plenty of specifics to worry about. That wasn't what I meant, though..."
Shadowheart,What's that look you're giving me? I feel like a mouse cornered by a cat.
Shadowheart,"I'd like room for animals. Lots of them - all shapes and sizes, so long as they appreciate a warm fire and more affection than they know what to do with."
Shadowheart,"Just wait until the others are asleep, then come with me. There's a place we can go, down the coast a little."
Shadowheart,What's on your mind? You must be pleased to have a clear path forward.
Shadowheart,The voice on the ship told me I'd become a 'beautiful weapon'. What do you think it meant?
Shadowheart,I saw you with Lae'zel. You two looked... cosy.
Shadowheart,I saw you with Wyll. You two looked... cosy.
Shadowheart,Far be it from me to judge. Blood must still be running a little hot after everything.
Shadowheart,I'm not sure this is a good idea.
Shadowheart,"There are lit fuses in our heads. Sooner or later, they're going to blow."
Shadowheart,"Each hour that passes, the thing inside us grows. We need to find a healer. Let's wake up at first light."
Shadowheart,Maybe we will get lucky. We're overdue some good fortune.<br>
Shadowheart,Maybe. But we might get lucky. We're overdue some good fortune.
Shadowheart,"Outside threats, perhaps."
Shadowheart,Fine. But not for too long.
Shadowheart,Spare me the petty tyrant routine - you're better than that.
Shadowheart,I saw you with Karlach. You two looked... cosy.
Shadowheart,You should get some rest. We've got hard times ahead.
Shadowheart,"Oh, it's going to be like that? I love strong women."
Shadowheart,"Oh, it's going to be like that? I love strong ones."
Shadowheart,They make the best servants.
Shadowheart,Get some rest. We move at dawn.
Shadowheart,"Doing the rounds, are you? You'd better get some rest."
Shadowheart,What were you two talking about?
Shadowheart,"You strike me as the reliable sort, but are you sure this is a good idea?"
Shadowheart,You and that githyanki.
Shadowheart,Fine. Just don't expect my confidence if I don't have yours.
Shadowheart,You and Wyll.
Shadowheart,You and the pale fellow.
Shadowheart,"Oh, it's going to be like that? I love strong men."
Shadowheart,You and Gale.
Shadowheart,I saw you with Gale. You two looked... cosy.
Shadowheart,Desperate people... refugees. Never gave them much thought. Certainly not that bunch in the grove.
Shadowheart,"And yes, I'm sure there's someone out there for you. Lae'zel for example - I saw her looking at you a little less murderously than usual. "
Shadowheart,"And yes, I'm sure there's someone out there for you. You should go see who'd like to spend the night with the saviour of the grove..."
Shadowheart,Maybe you would. But I'm not cruel enough to get your hopes up. In spite of what some might believe...
Shadowheart,"Oh you do, do you? I'm not some dewy-eyed tiefling maiden you just saved - you'll need to do a lot more leg-work before I commit to any hip-work."
Shadowheart,"For now. Don't worry, there'll be plenty of fun for you tonight. Just not in my tent."
Shadowheart,"What, some advice on how to make me more bearable? All right, if you like..."
Shadowheart,"Respect my mission, my beliefs, keep us focused on finding a cure..."
Shadowheart,"I'm not half as mysterious as you might think. Respect my privacy, my beliefs, keep us focused on finding a cure..."
Shadowheart,"If you do that, well... I see no reason why we shouldn't get closer."
Shadowheart,"But enough about me. I saw Wyll looking at you. I bet he'd like a word, or more..."
Shadowheart,"Now enough about me. Did you see the way Astarion's been looking at you? Hungry in more ways than usual, maybe. Go on, you know what to do..."
Shadowheart,I saw you with Astarion. You two looked... cosy.
Shadowheart,"Enough about me. I saw Lae'zel looking at you a little less murderously than usual. Go on, you know what to do..."
Shadowheart,"I'm not half as mysterious as you might think. Respect my privacy, my opinion, keep us focused on finding a cure..."
Shadowheart,Have fun... and don't be a stranger.
Shadowheart,Why I've no idea of what you mean...
Shadowheart,"Keep prodding, and maybe you'll find out for certain."
Shadowheart,"Now, on you go. And happy hunting."
Shadowheart,"I will, but not as much as you'll enjoy yours, I'm betting..."
Shadowheart,"That so? I won't pretend I'm not surprised... we haven't always seen eye to eye, after all."
Shadowheart,"I'd rather enjoy this wine on my own, so... find your entertainment elsewhere?"
Shadowheart,It's not talking enough for my liking. 
Shadowheart,I think you'll find I've been showing ample concern for myself since the moment we met.
Shadowheart,"What? No, don't be ridiculous."
Shadowheart,Now enough about me. You should go see who'd like to spend the night with the saviour of the grove...
Shadowheart,The leader of the pack comes to chat.
Shadowheart,"Don't play the fool, please."
Shadowheart,You seem reliable. I think you know how important it is that we find someone who can cure us. Best if we focus on that.
Shadowheart,"Better than I ought to. Other than the occasional mental exchange, it's almost as if we're not infected.<br>"
Shadowheart,It's so strange... do you remember the voice? From the ship?
Shadowheart,"Yes, almost like it's whispering to me still..."
Shadowheart,The voice said I'd become a 'beautiful weapon'. What do you think that means?
Shadowheart,Agreed. We can't take the lack of symptoms for granted.
Shadowheart,"All right, I've kept you from your blanket long enough. Rest well."
Shadowheart,"Whatever they were, those plans were interrupted by the dragons. "
Shadowheart,I suppose so. They've certainly been useful in a tight spot... 
Shadowheart,But there will be a price to pay. We can't take the lack of symptoms for granted.
Shadowheart,"The sooner we find a healer, the better. Get some rest."
Shadowheart,"The sooner we find Halsin, the better. Get some rest."
Shadowheart,"But other than the occasional mental exchange, it's almost as if we're not infected."
Shadowheart,For now. But we can't take the lack of symptoms for granted. We have to keep looking for a healer.
Shadowheart,I've said my piece. Good night.
Shadowheart,Hah! Adorable. But your timing is awful.
Shadowheart,"Whatever the mind flayers' plans were, those dragons spoiled them. That doesn't make our situation less dangerous."
Shadowheart,"Either way, we can't take the lack of symptoms for granted. We have to find a healer."
Shadowheart,"Well, I've said my piece. Get some rest."
Shadowheart,"Either way, we can't take the lack of symptoms for granted. We have to find Halsin."
Shadowheart,"After they put that tadpole in my eye, I heard this voice. It was... soothing."
Shadowheart,"Sorry... but a problem shared, and so on. We should discuss this."
Shadowheart,We should discuss this.
Shadowheart,"I couldn't help but overhear... well, all right, I could've helped, but didn't."
Shadowheart,"Anyway, I feel the same. Other than the occasional mental exchange, it's almost as if we're not infected."
Shadowheart,For now. But we can't take the lack of symptoms for granted. We have to keep looking for Halsin.
Shadowheart,"If we're to survive, we need to trust each other."
Shadowheart,Me too. It's hard to sleep knowing that thing is in your head.
Shadowheart,"Yes... me as well. Besides the occasional mental exchange, it's almost as if we're not infected."
Shadowheart,"And just to be clear, come daybreak, finding a healer is our first priority."
Shadowheart,"Good. We might even get lucky and find one right away. As I see it, we're overdue some good fortune. Rest well.<br>"
Shadowheart,We did just talk about it. Let's rest.
Shadowheart,Caution is a luxury we don't have. Let's rest and wake up at first light.
Shadowheart,These powers must have a price. They come from invasive parasites that will turn us into mind flayers.
Shadowheart,We need to get rid of them.
Shadowheart,Rest well. We'll need our strength.
Shadowheart,I'd be careful with Lae'zel.
Shadowheart,"She's a stranger to these parts, same as you. But you strike me as reasonable, while she has her own agenda. I'd be surprised if our interests remained aligned."
Shadowheart,She's not of this world. I'd be surprised if our interests remained aligned.
Shadowheart,Let's hope we rapidly find a healer.
Shadowheart,I feel... good. It's so strange... do you remember the voice? Aboard the ship?
Shadowheart,I'd be careful with Wyll.
Shadowheart,I was merely making an observation. 
Shadowheart,"...But speaking of focus, let's be clear: come daybreak, finding a healer is our first priority, yes?"
Shadowheart,So am I.
Shadowheart,"I think I've been more than candid - you know about my faith, for one thing."
Shadowheart,I have my reasons - they're nothing for you to be concerned about.
Shadowheart,"Either way, be careful. You never know what lengths someone might take to solve this little problem of ours."
Shadowheart,I'd be careful with Astarion.
Shadowheart,Trust is a rare currency. Not sure I'd spend it on someone who drew a knife on me moments after I met them.
Shadowheart,I'd be careful with Gale.
Shadowheart,He's a wizard. All they care about is power.
Shadowheart,I'd be careful with who you confide in.
Shadowheart,"Heroic types can be brittle, I find. Better to trust someone with greater flexibility."
Shadowheart,"And yes, I'm sure there's someone out there for you. I saw the way Astarion's been stealing glances at you. Hungry in more ways than usual, maybe. "
Shadowheart,Good. Until then. Get some rest while you can.
Shadowheart,"Well... don't laugh, but one thing I do remember about myself is that I can't swim. I think it's time I remedied that. And washed off Shar's bile at the same time."
Shadowheart,I'm in two minds - and frankly don't care a great deal. Either decision is fine by me.
Shadowheart,"Given our group's nature, I don't see much harm. We're each monsters in the making, after all."
Shadowheart,A vampire? Well that explains the pallor. 
Shadowheart,I'd just better not wake in the night to find fangs at my throat.
Shadowheart,"Grant me the time and guidance I need to become your vessel, my lady."
Shadowheart,I have ventured far from shadows. I have shared words with unbelievers. I have followed your teachings imperfectly.
Shadowheart,"Blessed Nightsinger, grant me mercy."
Shadowheart,"Let the earth feast on the blood of the faithless, until only those who seek the embrace remain."
Shadowheart,May the lives of your enemies be snuffed out like guttering candles.
Shadowheart,"Lend me your strength, my Lady of Loss, for the battles yet to come."
Shadowheart,Guide me where others fear to tread. Guide me to your embrace.
Shadowheart,"You were supposed to lend a hand, not take one."
Shadowheart,Let me follow in your path. Let me become one with your umbral splendour.
Shadowheart,"May a time come when the sun never rises again, and your darkness reaches eternity."
Shadowheart,"Let the pains of the day be forgotten, soothed by your embrace."
Shadowheart,"Praise be to Lady Shar. As the sun retreats once again, all becomes your realm."
Shadowheart,Take the weight off. You've earned it.
Shadowheart,I do enjoy our little sits together.
Shadowheart,It's been too long.
Shadowheart,Always a pleasure.
Shadowheart,I'm glad you decided to join me.
Shadowheart,"Tired, I take it?"
Shadowheart,Something you needed?
Shadowheart,"Ah, company."
Shadowheart,"Mistress of the Night, guide my hand, my step, my mind, and my blade."
Shadowheart,"Yes, you sit right there and let me drink in the sight of you."
Shadowheart,You seem to know enough about our condition to realise it is beyond most clerics' skills.
Shadowheart,"Staring at it won't provide any more answers, unfortunately. There's power to it - that's for certain."
Shadowheart,I don't doubt you in the slightest.
Shadowheart,This will do. Get in the water.
Shadowheart,"Go on, you're not afraid of getting a little wet, are you?"
Shadowheart,You know you didn't need to wait until I was in the water to hold me.
Shadowheart,Fool. No point in showing the beast kindness - it'll still bite you in the end.
Shadowheart,Lies. Just get rid of her.
Shadowheart,Fool. No point in showing a mad dog kindness - it'll still bite you in the end.
Shadowheart,I'll trust your judgement - but I won't trust her. Not until I've gotten the measure of her.
Shadowheart,Careful - she obviously sees your kindness as weakness. Don't let her take advantage.
Shadowheart,"Loyal, blind, and beguiled. Sounds like someone I know."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar's oblivion awaits us all in the end... but I am glad you'll be able to enjoy a taste of life beforehand, Karlach."
Shadowheart,Pretty tune. You're better with your mouth than I would have figured.<br>
Shadowheart,"It's an unorthodox way of cheating death... but if you're happy, I'm glad for you."
Shadowheart,Though I suppose Astarion feeding on Karlach is akin to a lone mosquito supping on a prize draft horse - it'll be a while before he can do any real damage.
Shadowheart,"You'll have to face oblivion another time, it seems. I'm glad for you, if it's what you want.<br>"
Shadowheart,"I'm glad for you, Karlach. It's hardly the life anyone dreams of, but, well... it's a life."
Shadowheart,"Let's take things down a notch, shall we? She's no devil, Wyll. You'll have to look elsewhere to find fodder for your blade."
Shadowheart,"Careful what you wish for, Jaheira. I have some form in humbling ladies of your vintage."
Shadowheart,"The darkness will prevail in the end, Jaheira. You're clinging on just to wage an unwinnable war."
Shadowheart,"I wallowed in darkness for too long. If I could extend the time I have left in the light, I think I'd take it."
Shadowheart,"My... some bard could write a stirring love poem about you two. Or a lewd tavern ballad, perhaps."
Shadowheart,Hands off!
Shadowheart,There's no getting rid of it. We'll just have to keep it hidden away.
Shadowheart,"It's useless - believe me, I've tried."
Shadowheart,"You're too generous, Karlach. Better hope he hasn't acquired a taste for you."
Shadowheart,Oh. If you insist...
Shadowheart,"Tired, love?"
Shadowheart,You should come over more often.
Shadowheart,Talk to me later. The day's been long enough already.
Shadowheart,"Though perhaps that might change, if you can show an open mind. "
Shadowheart,I'm not sorry I kept this from you. Not one bit.
Shadowheart,"Secrecy is everything for Shar's children. It's our code, our creed, our shield."
Shadowheart,A lie of omission at most. I'm sure you have some skeletons of your own hidden away.
Shadowheart,"Don't make a fuss, Selûnite - we may be at odds, but I have more important concerns than you right now."
Shadowheart,"I worship Shar, the Mistress of the Night. "
Shadowheart,"You're not going to let this go, are you?"
Shadowheart,"...I should have been more discreet around you, clearly. Yes, you're right."
Shadowheart,Never you mind.
Shadowheart,"It's nothing, I swear."
Shadowheart,Who says you have to feel anything?
Shadowheart,I... it's difficult for me to talk about. I'm sorry.
Shadowheart,"I'm fine. It's passed, whatever it was..."
Shadowheart,"No... or at least, I don't think so. Perhaps Lady Shar is testing me somehow. But if she is, then I have no idea what her purpose is."
Shadowheart,"I know that. I had just hoped you might show some more understanding. Leave me alone, please."
Shadowheart,I... thank you. But I'm sure it was nothing. I just... need a little space.
Shadowheart,I... I don't know.
Shadowheart,No... I'm fine. Forget it.
Shadowheart,Something's wrong. I feel... I feel...
Shadowheart,"What harm? She's little - won't take up much space, or make much of a dent in our provisions."
Shadowheart,I need them alive - stow that blade or I'll show you just how messy things can get.
Shadowheart,I need her alive - stow that blade or I'll show you just how messy things can get.
Shadowheart,I need him alive - stow that blade or I'll show you just how messy things can get.
Shadowheart,...and stop looking at me like that. I'm not sprouting tentacles just yet.
Shadowheart,I was hoping you'd come by.
Shadowheart,"Gather your thoughts. Then, perhaps, we can talk some more."
Shadowheart,Don't thank me - I'm breaking Lady Shar's teachings just by doing so... but sometimes you have to be practical.
Shadowheart,"People will start talking, with all the time we spend together..."
Shadowheart,You grace my stool? I'm honoured.
Shadowheart,There's plenty of space at camp - no need to crowd me.
Shadowheart,I don't recall inviting you over.
Shadowheart,Did you want something...?
Shadowheart,Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?
Shadowheart,"Now, play nice... claws and beak to yourself, please..."
Shadowheart,You'll be too much of a handful one day. But not yet.
Shadowheart,I swear you've grown since I last saw you...
Shadowheart,"Are you hungry? Better give you extra, so you don't nibble on me in the night..."
Shadowheart,"What do you get up to all day without us, hmm?"
Shadowheart,"All we can do is try, I suppose..."
Shadowheart,Scratch - so called because you like a scratch behind the ear?
Shadowheart,"Come over here, boy."
Shadowheart,Fumble in my head again and I'll gut you.
Shadowheart,"Please, it's nothing. Just let it rest."
Shadowheart,"Now that you have the truth, please don't make a big fuss about it."
Shadowheart,"I... yes, she must. I'll offer thanks to her in my prayers - and we should speak more later. Alone, ideally."
Shadowheart,"Your blindness as much as my deception, Selûnite. We can talk about this later - if you're willing."
Shadowheart,True. I didn't think you'd react so pragmatically. Perhaps I should have told you sooner.
Shadowheart,Then it's your own fault for not asking. 
Shadowheart,"Forever, ideally. And you assume too much about what I can and cannot tell. "
Shadowheart,Of course I am. But we can talk about this later - I want to enjoy the still of the night.
Shadowheart,If you insist. Don't expect to fare well without me to save you.
Shadowheart,"It's been a day, Scratch. Come here, boy."
Shadowheart,"Do you remember what I told you before, about how I can't swim? Well, I think it's time I remedied that. And washed off Shar's bile at the same time."
Shadowheart,We'd better get warmed up then. Come on.
Shadowheart,What's the matter?
Shadowheart,"I have my family back, and now I can't even look them in the eye. I don't deserve to be anyone's daughter."
Shadowheart,I'm sorry. You shouldn't have to see me like this.
Shadowheart,I can't be your Jenevelle. Not as you remember her.
Shadowheart,No. I'd be turning my back on too much. Shadowheart is as much a part of who I am as Jenevelle; I can't just forget her - that's not what I do anymore.
Shadowheart,"Besides, Shadowheart still suits me - even better than before, perhaps. You can't cast a shadow without some light."
Shadowheart,Don't worry. I'm still your daughter... if you want me to be.
Shadowheart,"Loss. Actual loss, not Shar's oblivion. I had my family, for too short a moment. Now they're gone. By my hand."
Shadowheart,I remember. But they can't comfort me. They can't give me advice. They can't tell me what I was like as a little girl.
Shadowheart,"But why does freedom have to feel like I've lost everything? Perhaps I could have saved them, or perhaps Shar would have helped me forget them. Instead, I've neither..."
Shadowheart,Perhaps not for long. The Absolute may yet put us out of our misery. I may see my parents again sooner than you think...
Shadowheart,It's been a long time since I shed a tear. I don't even know how long.
Shadowheart,Shame. More than I ever knew it was possible to feel. Shar left me with all the memories I need to punish myself.
Shadowheart,"We carry on - it's all we can do. I'll follow in a while, but I think I want to stay here a little longer, firstly. This place isn't familiar, but it's peaceful."
Shadowheart,"I'll follow. But I think I want to stay here a little longer, firstly. This place isn't familiar, but it's peaceful."
Shadowheart,"All about the mission. You sound like how I used to sound. I'm all right now. Or... close enough, anyway."
Shadowheart,"I'm all right now. Or... close enough, anyway."
Shadowheart,True. But too much freedom can be frightening... lonely. There's a reason why so many are eager to bow.
Shadowheart,"I had my family, for too short a moment. Now they're gone. By my hand."
Shadowheart,"So much time's been lost already. Most of it, I can't even remember. And what I do remember... it would have been so much easier to just become a monster."
Shadowheart,"You helped bring me to this point - you're as much a traitor as anyone. Besides, the betrayal was Shar's, not mine."
Shadowheart,Focus. What could be the cause of this?
Shadowheart,Resist the pain.
Shadowheart,"The pain guides. It teaches. Only when you stray from the Nightsinger's path, does it bite."
Shadowheart,This land is under the Lady Shar's sway. Maybe answers lie where her power is strongest.
Shadowheart,Shadowheart. She's as much a part of who I am as Jenevelle; I can't just forget her - that's not what I do anymore.
Shadowheart,There were Dark Justiciars here once - you saw the signs. You should heed them - learn more.
Shadowheart,"A very good thing. I don't know what I did to trick you into thinking I was worthy of you, but I'm glad it worked."
Shadowheart,It doesn't look like anyone's been here in a while. Perhaps people lost faith. Or... forgot about it.
Shadowheart,I need to take back control. Seize what I've been denied.
Shadowheart,You wouldn't say that if you ever saw me in the water.
Shadowheart,"Understood. Just keep me from drowning, and don't laugh while I flail about in waist-high water. That's all I ask."
Shadowheart,"A lot's changed since then. More than I ever thought was possible. And besides, she's no lady."
Shadowheart,"Strictly speaking you should have killed me the moment Shar banished me. But you didn't, for whatever reason. Help me, or don't."
Shadowheart,"I seem to recall you encouraging me to spare Nightsong. Perhaps you're more like me than you care to admit. Help me, or don't."
Shadowheart,I sacrificed my memory's for Shar- to preserve my mission. But one thing I do remember about myself is that I can't swim. I think it's time I remedied that. And washed off Shar's bile at the same time.
Shadowheart,Not quite. You'll see when we get there.
Shadowheart,I see. In that case you'd better go get some rest. Wouldn't want your focus to slip.
Shadowheart,"I did, and its too late for regrets... but I wish I felt a little more comfortable in my own skin."
Shadowheart,Don't be so quick to judge - she didn't ask anything of you. Who's to say you'd have handled it any differently?
Shadowheart,I wanted to come here. To see if I felt anything that I hadn't done before. Now that I know what I know. Now that I know who I am.
Shadowheart,"What's done is done, but I have an idea that might help me... if you're willing to play a part."
Shadowheart,Try to understand what's happening.
Shadowheart,Silently petition Lady Shar for guidance.
Shadowheart,It was nothing. Put it out of your mind.
Shadowheart,Of course it was worth it. Your whole life has been leading to this.
Shadowheart,Banish such doubts - they only distract from your faith.
Shadowheart,You cannot lie. Part of you regrets the cost in life. Yet it was Lady Shar's will.
Shadowheart,She must be purged. The Dark Lady demands it.
Shadowheart,You still wear your hair like a trainee. Time for something more... commanding.
Shadowheart,"That will come in time - your actions will speak for themselves. Now, rest."
Shadowheart,The Mother Superior always hindered your ambitions. Yet now you will unseat her. Ironic.
Shadowheart,"She saved your life, and made you who you are today. You owe her much."
Shadowheart,"Hmph - the famous Blade of Frontiers. Clever, this hero act you've got going."
Shadowheart,I know. But it's nice to hear you say it.
Shadowheart,There were Dark Justiciars here once - you saw the signs. There must be a temple - somewhere dedicated to Lady Shar.
Shadowheart,"Why were you alone in those woods? The gaps in your memories are vast, unnerving..."
Shadowheart,"Fine. Well don't just stand there, turn around."
Shadowheart,You haven't even attempted to peek. I'm a little offended.
Shadowheart,"That's one word for it, I suppose. You can turn around again."
Shadowheart,What? Don't just stare.
Shadowheart,I know. Your turn.
Shadowheart,"Don't just stare while you're still dressed, I mean. Come on, I kept up my end of the bargain - will you keep up yours?"
Shadowheart,You're what...? But I already took my clothes off.
Shadowheart,"Now come on, get those clothes off. You've made me wait long enough."
Shadowheart,I... I don't know if I can do this. Now that I'm here.
Shadowheart,All right. Just stay close...
Shadowheart,"More the drowning, and the things that could be hiding underwater, and the drowning, and the cold. Did I mention the drowning?"
Shadowheart,Come on then. We've already come this far.
Shadowheart,"Let's get on with it, before I lose my nerve."
Shadowheart,What...? Wait!
Shadowheart,Oh Hells that's cold.
Shadowheart,Thank you. I needed that. I needed to know I can face things without Shar.
Shadowheart,I don't want to go back. Not just yet.
Shadowheart,"I'd drag you into the sand if I thought I'd survive it. Then again, I suppose I can think of worse ways to die."
Shadowheart,"How about a night on the beach, under the stars? Together. Just near enough."
Shadowheart,Just a pebble.
Shadowheart,Now don't you dare stop.
Shadowheart,"Yes. A silent one, if you have any sense."
Shadowheart,You're lucky I didn't have anything more dangerous to throw than undergarments.
Shadowheart,A little misdirection. Couldn't resist.
Shadowheart,Wait - just give me a moment. I can manage. As long as you stay with me.
Shadowheart,Concentrate on your mission. The Mother Superior awaits your return to Baldur's Gate.
Shadowheart,Neither did I.
Shadowheart,"You don't want to get them wet, do you? Or worse, weigh you down. Go on; don't turn shy on me now."
Shadowheart,The pain must be a test. To embrace Lady Shar completely is to leave all pain and sorrow behind.
Shadowheart,This is the spot. Looks like someone's left poor Selûne untended...
Shadowheart,"Something of a much rarer vintage. After I offered up the Nightsong to Lady Shar, her blood was on the spear, on my hands, on my clothing. I wrung out every drop I could. Saved it for a special occasion."
Shadowheart,"Physically? No... that part is already done. This will wound the spirit. Most deeply, I should hope."
Shadowheart,"After I offered up the Nightsong to Lady Shar, her blood was on the spear, on my hands, on my clothing. I wrung out every drop I could. Saved it for a special occasion."
Shadowheart,Let's see what comfort we can offer a grieving mother.
Shadowheart,You did well. I hope you're not trying to surpass me in Lady Shar's graces.
Shadowheart,Yes. But I'm afraid I forgot to bring any food...
Shadowheart,"It means nothing. Shar owns my heart. But luckily she's willing to share the rest of me, just this once."
Shadowheart,That's what makes it so good.
Shadowheart,"But whatever you have to give... it's not enough, is it?"
Shadowheart,"Well you can't be of much help to me from the shoreline, can you? Shouting moral support while I drown?"
Shadowheart,A shame. I wanted to show you just how rewarding the embrace of darkness could be... but perhaps it is not meant for you. Good night.
Shadowheart,"First the act of wickedness, then the feast... but I think this will count as both at once."
Shadowheart,"Go, then. Maybe you can do better by yourself, though I doubt it."
Shadowheart,A little. I like it.
Shadowheart,Oh yes? Show me.
Shadowheart,I'm not afraid. Far from it.
Shadowheart,Indeed? And what else might you be willing to do...?
Shadowheart,"Fine suggestions, all. Perhaps another time."
Shadowheart,"Go, then. Lady Shar's blessings can be for me alone."
Shadowheart,"It seems to be the perfect night to spend a little time together, just you and I... assuming you haven't changed your mind, of course?"
Shadowheart,"Oh. A pity - I've been missing out on beauty sleep, just to wait up on you. Good night."
Shadowheart,This will do. Take off your clothes.
Shadowheart,Stop being so gentle.
Shadowheart,"And yes, I'm sure there's someone out there for you. You should have seen the look Wyll was giving you earlier..."
Shadowheart,"And yes, I'm sure there's someone out there for you. Gale's been stealing a glance or three in your direction..."
Shadowheart,"You're putting words in my mouth - I never said I disliked you. It's just we have some work to do, to get on each other's good sides."
Shadowheart,Ignore Shar. Turn to free your parents.
Shadowheart,Use Selûne's power to break their bindings.
Shadowheart,Call on Selûne's power to end their suffering.
Shadowheart,Goodbye.
Shadowheart,Are you sure this is what you want?
Shadowheart,But I only just found you again.
Shadowheart,I'm not harming you. I can't.
Shadowheart,Did she mean what I think she did...?
Shadowheart,I don't care - I've found my parents. I've won.
Shadowheart,First I need to get you out of these restraints. Then find your way to our camp - you'll be safe there.
Shadowheart,"No, I'm not giving up on you. We can weather whatever Shar has in store for us, together."
Shadowheart,Jenevelle... Is that my name?
Shadowheart,The hells with this. I'm here to save you.
Shadowheart,I'm here to get you out of this place. 
Shadowheart,I still remember. Who they were. What I did to them...
Shadowheart,They're... they're my parents? What have you done to them?
Shadowheart,That was me... I hurt them. How?
Shadowheart,"If this is a test, what must I do?"
Shadowheart,What am I to do now?
Shadowheart,Who are these people?
Shadowheart,"Is it over? Have I proven myself, Lady Shar?"
Shadowheart,"What happened? I remember entering this chamber, then... nothing."
Shadowheart,I still remember. Everything I did to them.
Shadowheart,Unleash Lady Shar's power. Sacrifice them.
Shadowheart,"You're a monster, not a goddess."
Shadowheart,Don't call me that. My name is Shadowheart.
Shadowheart,I don't understand - who are these people?
Shadowheart,What have you done to them?!
Shadowheart,"I'm sorry... I need to obey my parents' wishes, this once. If you are sure this is what you want...?"
Shadowheart,"Get out of this place, as soon as your strength allows. There's a camp - you'll be safe there."
Shadowheart,You're no burden. You're my strength. I think I know where my wilful side comes from now.
Shadowheart,I didn't come this far just to give up at the final hurdle. We're leaving this place together. I'm going to take care of you.
Shadowheart,"But I only just found you again, after all this time. I can't lose you again."
Shadowheart,"No, I can't. I came here for them."
Shadowheart,She's gone... I don't understand.
Shadowheart,Enough. I'm taking my parents away from here. I'm taking them away from you.
Shadowheart,"I'm here to get you out of here. They're all gone, it's over -"
Shadowheart,Do what's right. I think I lost sight of that some time ago. Better to just serve blindly.
Shadowheart,What's right... Have I ever known what that truly is?
Shadowheart,They're... they're my parents.
Shadowheart,"Yes. But we're not finished with the Absolute just yet. Only now, Lady Shar's forces are mine to command, when the battle comes."
Shadowheart,"It's time we left. We're not finished with the Absolute just yet. Only now, Shar's forces are mine to command, when the battle comes."
Shadowheart,"Don't be ridiculous - I never knew my parents. Whoever these poor wretches were, they're strangers to me."
Shadowheart,"It's done. This place is mine now. Shar's forces are mine, when I need them. And her power... it's right at my fingertips. I can't believe it."
Shadowheart,I still remember.
Shadowheart,"No, you're right to urge haste. There'll be time for a proper reunion later - let's get clear of this place."
Shadowheart,I will be. Once we all get clear of this place.
Shadowheart,"I... I did that? Gods, how did I do that to them... so many times?"
Shadowheart,I'm leaving this place. And I'm taking my parents with me.
Shadowheart,I am saving myself.
Shadowheart,I have to do it. My whole life has been leading to this.
Shadowheart,They're my parents... I don't know if I can.
Shadowheart,"Sacrifices. My final test, whoever they are. A rather meagre offering to the Dark Lady... but it is not my place to question her."
Shadowheart,"Don't be. They're free now, as am I. And part of them is still here with me."
Shadowheart,"I shall carry out your will, my Lady."
Shadowheart,I'm getting you out of here. There's a place where you'll be safe.
Shadowheart,Very supportive of her.
Shadowheart,How did they react?
Shadowheart,I did not see you amongst my supporters when I faced Viconia - can I trust you?
Shadowheart,"What comes next? The Chamber of Loss. Viconia is gone, and soon I will rule."
Shadowheart,"Viconia's gone, and this place can rot as far as I'm concerned. You should leave."
Shadowheart,What comes next? My rule over this place. You will resume your duties.
Shadowheart,Remind me.
Shadowheart,"Most would consider us enemies, not friends. "
Shadowheart,I'm glad you're happy.
Shadowheart,I... I remember you. But you're different. Very different. And that name is new.
Shadowheart,"Viconia would have you hide down here, oblivious to the true danger - the Absolute must be stopped, and only I can lead you. Lady Shar has decreed it!"
Shadowheart,Perhaps she was telling you what you wanted to hear. To keep you bound to Shar.
Shadowheart,Enough speeches - the odds are already in my favour. Do you think the Dark Lady would want you to die for a lost cause? Or show some cunning and live another day?
Shadowheart,I sank a spear into the heart of the Moonwitch's daughter. Lady Shar rewarded me - she turned the pain that once held me back into the power that now drives me on.
Shadowheart,"I'm not here to convince you, Mother. You are already disgraced in Lady Shar's eyes. I merely wish to give the others a chance to repent, before they are dragged down with you."
Shadowheart,Tell them what you witnessed. Tell them how Lady Shar favours me.
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar protected me. She guided me, elevated me. And now she wants me to cast you down. "
Shadowheart,You think you know better than the Dark Lady? No wonder she sent me to this place of your poison.
Shadowheart,Tell her. Tell them all. Tell them how the Nightsinger has blessed me.
Shadowheart,"No. I already faced Lady Shar. I passed her trials, I wielded her spear, and now I am her mortal voice. I have been embraced by her in ways you could only dream of."
Shadowheart,What? No!
Shadowheart,"No! Were you meaning to backstab me all along, or did you lose your spine along the way? "
Shadowheart,Likewise.
Shadowheart,"I should thank you. If you hadn't sent me on that suicide mission, I'd never have learned the truth. "
Shadowheart,And she told me to cleanse her church of those who failed her.
Shadowheart,I thought you were my goddess... but you're just a monster.
Shadowheart,Perhaps she was telling you what you wanted to hear. To keep you in Lady Shar's embrace.
Shadowheart,"I remember none of this - or at least, almost none of it."
Shadowheart,I... I hurt you both. So much. Gods forgive me...
Shadowheart,Do as you are commanded to. End their suffering.
Shadowheart,No. I can't do this.
Shadowheart,It's me. I'm Jenevelle.
Shadowheart,"I don't believe it. Tell me it's not real, my Lady. Tell me it's a test."
Shadowheart,This can't be... Are they my parents? What have you done to them?
Shadowheart,Moonmaiden? Who the hells are you two?
Shadowheart,That was me. I did that. How...?
Shadowheart,Thanks.
Shadowheart,Can I have my memories back.
Shadowheart,Give me my memories back.
Shadowheart,Shar is evil. She ruins lives. The acceptance of her disciple is nothing worth cherishing.
Shadowheart,Can I have my memories back?
Shadowheart,That's... good enough for me. I'm not sure what I expected coming back to this place - certainly not a friend.
Shadowheart,"Shar condemned me. By her decree, you and I are enemies."
Shadowheart,I don't remember you.
Shadowheart,You don't need Shar. 
Shadowheart,Indeed. There must be all sorts of things you could tell me.
Shadowheart,There must be all sorts you can tell me. Things I can't even remember.
Shadowheart,Perhaps you're right... but I trusted her once. That has to count for something.
Shadowheart,"I wish... to know more. There must be all sort of things you can tell me. Little things from my past, lost to Lady Shar's embrace."
Shadowheart,"Her followers... and my friends, in at least some cases. I was so focused on getting here, on finishing this, I forgot about the life I had here."
Shadowheart,I've been trying to return here as long as I can remember... which admittedly doesn't amount to much.
Shadowheart,It's a beautiful name. Suits you well.
Shadowheart,Give my my memories back.
Shadowheart,Shar doesn't care. She was always going to use you and discard you - but now I'm going to deal with you first.
Shadowheart,Let's leave this place. There's nothing more for me here.
Shadowheart,"Shadowheart, still. I can't run away from who I was for all this time. Besides, there's something fitting to it - you can't cast a shadow without some light."
Shadowheart,Won't leave an ally in a bind.<br>
Shadowheart,This'll make it better. Ssh...
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, I'll help."
Shadowheart,Can't leave a friend trapped.<br>
Shadowheart,Can't leave an ally stuck.
Shadowheart,"I like her. She looks like she could throw me over her shoulder and carry me to safety, should the need arise."
Shadowheart,"Stand down, Wyll. She's fiery, but no devil."
Shadowheart,I'm down.
Shadowheart,My lady...
Shadowheart,Healer!<br>
Shadowheart,I need help!
Shadowheart,Can't leave you stuck.
Shadowheart,Ungh! I'm hit!
Shadowheart,Please... help...
Shadowheart,Ngh... no!
Shadowheart,Let's see what I can pilfer.
Shadowheart,Let's see what's to be had.
Shadowheart,"Worth a bit of finger work, perhaps."
Shadowheart,Better fetch that.
Shadowheart,I should take that.
Shadowheart,Might be useful.<br>
Shadowheart,Maybe we could get him to wear a bell - dissuade any night-time prowling.
Shadowheart,Better take that.
Shadowheart,"Hmm, let's see..."
Shadowheart,I need aid.
Shadowheart,I should fetch that.
Shadowheart,Won't leave you behind.<br>
Shadowheart,Let's see what my touch can do.<br>
Shadowheart,"Yes. I know it must seem like I pulled this out of thin air, but that's how Lady Shar chose to reveal herself to me. You'll see for yourself, soon enough."
Shadowheart,There's a library in this place somewhere. That's where I need to look.
Shadowheart,"Without it, the sacrifice to my Lady will be in vain, and I won't be blessed as a Dark Justiciar."
Shadowheart,Supposedly in the library we saw before - we should go back to it.
Shadowheart,We need to get that spear - there's a library in this place somewhere. That's where I need to look.
Shadowheart,We need to get that spear - supposedly it's in the library we saw before.
Shadowheart,We need to find that spear.
Shadowheart,"As luck would have it, we have the spear already. Time to move on."
Shadowheart,"Don't go soft on me now - this is hardly the first life we've taken. Besides, this place has been empty for years - the sacrifice can't be a simple mortal. More likely a monster."
Shadowheart,"Don't worry. This place has been empty for years - the sacrifice can't be a simple mortal. More likely it's a monster - and we're well-versed in dealing with those, aren't we?"
Shadowheart,"There is a holy weapon hidden away - the Spear of Night. I have to claim it, then use it to make a sacrifice in Lady Shar's inner sanctum. If I succeed, I'll become a Dark Justiciar."
Shadowheart,Might prove useful.<br>
Shadowheart,"There's something more I need to do, or the trials will have been in vain."
Shadowheart,No. This is different... very different.
Shadowheart,Nothing. Nothing's wrong at all.
Shadowheart,Wait...
Shadowheart,Tense for battle.
Shadowheart,It's nothing. I just got lost in my own thoughts.
Shadowheart,Shar. She spoke to me. I have to find a sacred spear and make a sacrifice in her name.
Shadowheart,"Quiet - this is some trick. The parasite, toying with my mind. Stop it."
Shadowheart,Lady Shar...?
Shadowheart,Who are you? Show yourself!
Shadowheart,"I won't fail you, my Lady."
Shadowheart,Lady Shar...? Is that you?
Shadowheart,"It's fine, really. I just feel we're on the right track. I'm right where I need to be - under Lady Shar's gaze."
Shadowheart,I don't know where home is anymore... but it's not here.
Shadowheart,Better take that.<br>
Shadowheart,Better help.
Shadowheart,"I've heard enough - leave. Vanish, or you'll wish I killed you here."
Shadowheart,Kill her.
Shadowheart,"Leave. Leave and vanish, or you'll wish I killed you here."
Shadowheart,Are you expecting sympathy?
Shadowheart,What are you talking about?
Shadowheart,You're lying. I wouldn't do that.
Shadowheart,"I could demonstrate some techniques, if you insist."
Shadowheart,Answer me.
Shadowheart,Why me? What was all this for?
Shadowheart,Where are they?!
Shadowheart,I'm not done with you yet. My parents. Where are they?
Shadowheart,"Get out of here. If you're wise, you'll vanish for good."
Shadowheart,"Leave. If you're wise, you'll vanish as if you're dead and buried."
Shadowheart,I won't remember you at all. Nobody will.
Shadowheart,I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't know any of this was happening until it was much too late. I came to try put things right.
Shadowheart,Is this truly what you want?
Shadowheart,"Free, but with the memory of what I've done. Don't ask me to kill my parents, please. I can't live with that."
Shadowheart,"And replace it with another. Don't ask me to kill my parents, please. I can't live with that."
Shadowheart,Yes. It was worth it. No words of yours can diminish that.
Shadowheart,To be free of Shar? To end my parents' suffering and show them it wasn't all in vain?
Shadowheart,My parents are watching over me. 
Shadowheart,Moon motes. They bring Selûne's light to dark places and offer guidance to those in need.
Shadowheart,In a way. But they're also right here - look.
Shadowheart,Let it stay forgotten.
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, Mother. I'll learn from your mistakes."
Shadowheart,Might prove useful.
Shadowheart,"Finish it? No - I want you to live, having lost everything. Leave."
Shadowheart,My parents. Where are they?
Shadowheart,Trapped. Better offer help.<br>
Shadowheart,"Stuck, eh? Hold on."
Shadowheart,Better lend a hand.
Shadowheart,The Dark Lady rewards me.
Shadowheart,Unseen. Perfect.<br>
Shadowheart,This'll do nicely.
Shadowheart,It pays to be light-fingered.
Shadowheart,"In and out, like a ghost."
Shadowheart,A gentle touch pays off.
Shadowheart,"Mystra is a lesser goddess compared to Lady Shar, but if you have a chance to speak to her, you should seize it."
Shadowheart,"An audience with your goddess can go wrong - I should know - but do whatever you feel is best, Gale."
Shadowheart,She still has answers I need.
Shadowheart,"Go on, Gale - see what Mystra has to say for herself. She was never deserving of your worship, anyway."
Shadowheart,"Kill her, or turn her loose. It doesn't matter. She's finished, either way."
Shadowheart,First I need answers.
Shadowheart,You deal with her then. I need to find my parents.
Shadowheart,She doesn't care about any of us.
Shadowheart,"No, it doesn't."
Shadowheart,Go. Vanish as if you were dead.
Shadowheart,I doubt Shar will look too kindly on her failure - we all know how she treats those who disappoint her.
Shadowheart,I want to see my parents. And I don't care what happens to this one. She's been in my head long enough already. Do what you like. I know you'll choose well.
Shadowheart,Why? Why me? Why all this effort?
Shadowheart,I know. But she's not lying. She made me in her image.
Shadowheart,Answer me!
Shadowheart,"You can do this, Gale. Standing up to a goddess is... daunting, but you'll be glad once it's over."
Shadowheart,That's right. I know what you did. And it's not going to be quick - not for you.
Shadowheart,Enough. I don't answer to you. Not anymore. I'm here for my family.
Shadowheart,The threat of the Absolute is upon you all - and Viconia is not fit to lead you!
Shadowheart,Perhaps the Mother Superior has her reasons. Perhaps you are not ready.
Shadowheart,"The Dark Justiciars' true seat of power must be somewhere nearby. You should find it, and realise your dream at last."
Shadowheart,Something must have caused the Dark Justiciars to vanish as they did. You owe it to Lady Shar to discover what happened to her servants.
Shadowheart,"Well, looks can be deceiving."
Shadowheart,"I saw something that reminded me of... well, it's private. But then I felt something rise within me, like my blood was on fire. Then it passed. That's all I know."
Shadowheart,Let's just move along. Time's a rare currency for both of us.
Shadowheart,I do.
Shadowheart,I'll take you as I find you. Now let the matter rest.
Shadowheart,I don't know - what more can I say? 
Shadowheart,"If I knew, I promise I'd tell you. But I don't. Can we just leave it at that for now, please?"
Shadowheart,Nothing. A trick of the light.
Shadowheart,"Come on, Karlach. There's got to be more to this - some other way."
Shadowheart,"Maybe... it felt oddly familiar, but I don't know why..."
Shadowheart,"It's stopped now, whatever it is. Let's just carry on."
Shadowheart,It felt... oddly familiar. But I don't know why.
Shadowheart,I... I don't know exactly. Lady Shar protect me.
Shadowheart,Your guess is as good as mine.
Shadowheart,"Nothing to be done about it now, anyway."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps Lady Shar is testing me somehow... perhaps not. I don't know, in short."
Shadowheart,"You already know as much as I do. Best ignore it, as long as it doesn't hamper us too much."
Shadowheart,We... we should keep moving.
Shadowheart,Breathe deep. Resist the sensation.
Shadowheart,Accept the pain.
Shadowheart,Try to recall why this is happening.
Shadowheart,"I saw something that reminded me of my faith... my mission. I felt something rise within me, like my blood was on fire. Then it passed. That's all I know."
Shadowheart,To even touch that filth would be to dishonour Shar. 
Shadowheart,The wound upon your hand - the one that never fully heals. What is its purpose?
Shadowheart,The wound on your hand caused this. What is it?
Shadowheart,This is fairly barbaric and vulgar.<br>
Shadowheart,Good. Selûne is a bad omen - just look what's befallen her temple. 
Shadowheart,Good. I wasn't intending to.
Shadowheart,A ruin abandoned to a murderous horde is a very fitting dedication to Selûne.
Shadowheart,"Respect's given freely. If your goddess needs to demand it, she's not worthy of it."
Shadowheart,"Though I'll grant it must have been impressive once, in all its profane glory... I wonder what happened."
Shadowheart,"Though I'll grant it must have been impressive once, in all its profane glory... until someone razed it."
Shadowheart,"We don't have time for this. Besides, I already explained myself."
Shadowheart,Nothing. Merely an observation.
Shadowheart,Spare me your dramatics. I already told you all there is to tell. Let's go.
Shadowheart,Is your hearing failing you? Or your wits perhaps? There's nothing more to say. Let's move.
Shadowheart,Offer a silent prayer to Lady Shar for her protection.
Shadowheart,"I worship Shar, the Mistress of the Night. It is my holy mission to oppose Selûne, her teachings and her followers."
Shadowheart,Only that you're overthinking a simple deduction I made.
Shadowheart,No matter. I'll breathe easier once we're clear of this place.
Shadowheart,Selûne is a bad omen - just look what's befallen her temple. 
Shadowheart,"Quite the understatement, but yes. Let's not linger in this place any more than necessary."
Shadowheart,"Let's do what we have to, then get out of here."
Shadowheart,Someone razed this place - a foe of Selûne. Perhaps they can still be found.
Shadowheart,"Whatever happened, it's undeniable that this place must have been impressive once. "
Shadowheart,No matter. Rejoice in the desecration of this foul place.
Shadowheart,"Perhaps it is just a coincidence. But reason to praise Shar, all the same."
Shadowheart,"No matter who razed it, it's undeniable that this place must have been impressive once. "
Shadowheart,This could be the work of Shar's faithful. It would be wise to look for more signs.
Shadowheart,"You're not going to let this go, are you? You might wish you had..."
Shadowheart,A githyanki prince? Is this why the mother superior seeks this relic?
Shadowheart,Taking them is the pragmatic choice.
Shadowheart,But you'll steal them? An interesting way to show your devotion.
Shadowheart,Strange... you know who I never thought I'd find myself caring for?
Shadowheart,Exactly right. Never gave them much thought. Certainly not that bunch in the grove.
Shadowheart,"Your words, not mine. But not what I mean."
Shadowheart,"I wouldn't quite say that... but no, that's not what I mean."
Shadowheart,I mean desperate people... like those refugees. Never gave them much thought. Certainly not that bunch in the grove.
Shadowheart,Yet we came through for them. We saved their lives. Odd.
Shadowheart,That's more easily said by some than others.
Shadowheart,Something like that. I was taught to reject anything that distracted from Shar...
Shadowheart,...but there'll be time for penance later.
Shadowheart,How pragmatic. One would think letting the goblins torch the grove would have resulted in the same.
Shadowheart,But nobody's here to debate right from wrong. 
Shadowheart,Everyone seems to be in high spirits. 
Shadowheart,Share a bottle with me?
Shadowheart,There - some liquid courage. And try to get some rest too if you can; tomorrow's another day.
Shadowheart,We should wait a little while. Until the others have drifted off.
Shadowheart,Best not keep me waiting. I'd prefer not to entertain myself...
Shadowheart,Not tonight.
Shadowheart,As you like. Try not to tire yourself out too much.
Shadowheart,Just a bottle. I think you have other plans afterwards - wouldn't want to keep you.
Shadowheart,"...Well, maybe I would. But first come, first served."
Shadowheart,"Best enjoyed someplace private, I think."
Shadowheart,I thought you might've wanted to mingle with the others.
Shadowheart,"True. But I thought you might not want to linger with me. We haven't always seen eye to eye, after all."
Shadowheart,"I mean you saved the grove. I'm sure you'll find you're quite popular, if you look around."
Shadowheart,I won't keep you long - I gather you've already made plans with someone for your evening.
Shadowheart,I do. Thank you for understanding.
Shadowheart,Best hope all this wine makes me forget what you tried to do.
Shadowheart,Don't forget our little agreement. As soon as things quiet down here...
Shadowheart,It does. Thank you.
Shadowheart,I never knew Selûne's followers were quite so wretched. Do as you please.
Shadowheart,Spare me the indignity - you looked set to loot this sad little shrine.
Shadowheart,Take them if you must. But I'll remember you didn't listen to sense.
Shadowheart,Fine. Perhaps you can sell them for a couple of coins. 
Shadowheart,Trifling with that moon witch will only bring you trouble. Shar's guidance is clear.
Shadowheart,"I almost pity her, if you're the quality of follower she attracts."
Shadowheart,You were just about to loot this shrine - don't pretend you're offended now.
Shadowheart,Of course I am. But we can talk about this later - let's go.
Shadowheart,Gather your thoughts. Then perhaps we can talk some more.
Shadowheart,Talk to me later. We've got more pressing matters to see to right now.
Shadowheart,We should've had wine more often. More warming than the fire.
Shadowheart,"I even keep secrets from myself - I had my memories suppressed, so that nothing I knew could be used against the Dark Lady. Once I prove myself, my memories will be restored."
Shadowheart,"Because we've enough troubles and burdens as it is. Common sense, that's all."
Shadowheart,"I worship Shar, Mistress of the Night - Selûne's twin and foe."
Shadowheart,I should've just stayed quiet. You want the truth? Fine.
Shadowheart,Do not trifle with that moon witch or her trinkets. Only trouble will follow.
Shadowheart,"This rubbish is an offering to Selûne. At best, it's worthless. At worst... who knows? Could be cursed."
Shadowheart,"You should leave it. Or even destroy it, if possible."
Shadowheart,That thing's killing her!
Shadowheart,It wasn't just her fate we decided... Wyll - he belongs to the Hells now. 
Shadowheart,Six months? We could be long dead before that long's elapsed.
Shadowheart,I already got my answer. Let's not make this awkward.
Shadowheart,Enjoy the rest of your night. But maybe do it elsewhere.
Shadowheart,"... I should have been more discreet around you, clearly. Yes, you're right."
Shadowheart,I sacrificed others so that I could become who I needed to be - I won't deny you the same chance. 
Shadowheart,"At the cost of a lot of lives. It's not worth it, Astarion."
Shadowheart,"All those lives, just snuffed out... I hope it was worth it."
Shadowheart,You know me? Can't say the feeling's mutual. Maybe you're just forgettable.
Shadowheart,"There is something I lost... no, had taken from me. My family. My life. I want it all back -"
Shadowheart,Mother Superior... Viconia DeVir.
Shadowheart,I... I can't. My memories -
Shadowheart,"The Mother Superior, of Shar's... It's you."
Shadowheart,The artefact. I was sent to retrieve it. At any cost.
Shadowheart,I have a mission to fulfil. I must -
Shadowheart,That voice... Allow me. I think I'm supposed to do this.
Shadowheart,None of your concern.
Shadowheart,I want my lost memories restored.
Shadowheart,My life was taken from me. I want it back.
Shadowheart,"Do I know you? I like to be on a first-name basis before I give someone a thrashing, ideally."
Shadowheart,I can't remember.
Shadowheart,The Mother Superior sent me.
Shadowheart,Enough of this - who are you?
Shadowheart,My purpose... You mean the artefact.
Shadowheart,Get out of my head.
Shadowheart,My mission brought me here.
Shadowheart,For the Mapping of the Heart. I wish to be Unburdened.
Shadowheart,My Mother Superior sent me.
Shadowheart,"The artefact. That's what you want to hear about, isn't it?"
Shadowheart,That voice... Do I know you?
Shadowheart,I'm here for the Mapping of the Heart. I wish to be Unburdened.
Shadowheart,Shouldn't you be in someone else's bedroll by now?
Shadowheart,The artefact doesn't matter anymore. Not to me.
Shadowheart,You sure know how to keep a party interesting.
Shadowheart,Let me enter.
Shadowheart,"Stand aside, whoever you are."
Shadowheart,You've heard enough. Show the holdouts the power that Lady Shar has blessed you with.
Shadowheart,Lady Shar didn't ask you to do this. You betrayed her - pursued your own goals.
Shadowheart,"Tell me one thing at least, before we end this - why did you want the artefact?"
Shadowheart,Show the holdouts the power that Lady Shar has blessed you with.
Shadowheart,The artefact is too powerful for you. The mission cannot be fulfilled. Lady Shar wishes for me to take your place.
Shadowheart,No. Lady Shar has chosen me to cleanse her ranks - you no longer have her blessing.
Shadowheart,I've heard enough.
Shadowheart,You sent us against the Absolute? The githyanki? It was a suicide mission from the start.
Shadowheart,You're acting against Shar. She'll damn you as quickly as she damned me.
Shadowheart,"Why do you even want the artefact so badly? Tell me the truth, at least this once."
Shadowheart,No. It will never be yours.
Shadowheart,The Mapping of the Heart...?
Shadowheart,I don't answer to you. Not anymore. I'm here for my family.
Shadowheart,I'll take your silence to mean utmost trust and respect then. Just follow my lead.
Shadowheart,Really? After everything we've been through? Sit on your misgivings for now - this is nearly over.
Shadowheart,Let us through. You know I'm expected.
Shadowheart,Then just trust me a little longer - this is almost over.
Shadowheart,"They're my people - I know them even if I don't remember them. You trust me, don't you?"
Shadowheart,Spare me your venom - I'm sure the Mother Superior will have plenty of her own.
Shadowheart,I met a man who'd been robbed of his memories - your handiwork?
Shadowheart,I need to enter.
Shadowheart,I need to see the Mother Superior.
Shadowheart,Do I know you?
Shadowheart,"So, this must be where the Unburdening occurs... exactly what is that?"
Shadowheart,"I've come too far to turn back now. Just a little longer - we're near the end of this, one way or another."
Shadowheart,Makes me wonder if you treat all your lovers that harshly.
Shadowheart,At least you've spared them the hangover tomorrow.
Shadowheart,The fire's nice. I'll stay here a while.
Shadowheart,"No more war tonight, I think."
Shadowheart,"I'd prefer the quiet, if it's all the same to you."
Shadowheart,"Get a girl's hopes up, why don't you? I need another bottle."
Shadowheart,You're the one becoming! Disgusting...
Shadowheart,...It's all disgusting.
Shadowheart,Guilty? Ridiculous. What's there to be guilty for?
Shadowheart,I serve the Lady of Loss. We stripped those tieflings of hope itself.
Shadowheart,Just... let me enjoy a drink in peace.
Shadowheart,My goddess smiles on such bloodshed.
Shadowheart,Why did killing those tieflings make me feel sick?
Shadowheart,I've killed in her name before. Why now? Why isn't the wine helping?
Shadowheart,But I appreciate the thought.
Shadowheart,You just... you! Get away from me. Now.
Shadowheart,I think we're finished here. Let's go.
Shadowheart,You did the right thing. All those deaths would have weighed you down.
Shadowheart,"I didn't realise you had such a soft streak, Astarion. Now it'll cost you. And the city as well, perhaps..."
Shadowheart,"I hope that was worth it. Even the Absolute's armies couldn't hope to kill so many, so quickly."
Shadowheart,Well done. You did what was best for you - don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Shadowheart,"Don't do it, Astarion. Thousands will die unless you stay your hand."
Shadowheart,"I can see your scars... all of them. I know what it's like to suffer like that, only I bear fewer reminders on my skin."
Shadowheart,"No, Astarion! Stop this!"
Shadowheart,Some destinies require sacrifice. Do as you must.
Shadowheart,You did the right thing. Some sacrifices just aren't worth it.
Shadowheart,"I can't say I'd have done the same, but your choice in the end.<br>"
Shadowheart,Ugh. Later. Ground's spinning.
Shadowheart,"It's awkward for me too, you know."
Shadowheart,"Thank you. The offer's kind, but it's not a kindness I can afford."
Shadowheart,I prefer to keep a few things secret. It's old habit.
Shadowheart,Entertain yourself elsewhere.
Shadowheart,What a glorious celebration. Hip-deep in gore.
Shadowheart,And you're carousing with Astarion.
Shadowheart,"The corpses probably do something extra for him, don't they?"
Shadowheart,He does seem like the decadent type.
Shadowheart,And you're carousing with Lae'zel.
Shadowheart,I'm surprised she hasn't dragged you off to rut already.
Shadowheart,Not that I'm judging. I have this.
Shadowheart,And you're carousing with Minthara.
Shadowheart,Careful that she doesn't take a piece of you as a souvenir.
Shadowheart,The goblins stole good wine. It goes straight to the head.
Shadowheart,What's wrong with enjoying a gift from our guests?
Shadowheart,"Maybe if I down enough of this swill, it'll pickle the worm in my skull."
Shadowheart,We set a pack of refugees on fire. A child could have done it.
Shadowheart,Not exactly an ambush for the ages.
Shadowheart,"Not interested in a vampire's leftovers, I'm afraid."
Shadowheart,"Not interested in Astarion's leftovers, I'm afraid."
Shadowheart,"Not interested in a gith's leftovers, I'm afraid."
Shadowheart,"Not interested in Minthara's leftovers, I'm afraid."
Shadowheart,Maybe... but I know better than to share my bed drunk.
Shadowheart,Unless you meant to raise my spirits by other means?
Shadowheart,"Ah, sitting. Such an engaging activity."
Shadowheart,But that... doesn't sound half bad.
Shadowheart,"Well, I don't find you entertaining in the least."
Shadowheart,"In fact, I prefer the wine to your blind stabs at mockery. Get away from me."
Shadowheart,"The way forward will be of little importance if I don't fulfil my mission. If you've any sense, you'll help me."
Shadowheart,You must have an extraordinary affinity for the darkness. I'm jealous.
Shadowheart,"A chance to breathe, hopefully. This has all been... very draining."
Shadowheart,I can respect that sort of loyalty. It's not all that removed from what was instilled in me...
Shadowheart,"Well I'm not most. I respect drow. I've no quarrel with you, unless you make one."
Shadowheart,A disguise? You could've picked something a little less conspicuous.
Shadowheart,"Anyway, we've both got more pressing concerns - like these tadpoles in each of our heads."
Shadowheart,What the - you were on the ship with me! How did you get inside here...?
Shadowheart,What're you doing...?
Shadowheart,Oh is  that what you're doing? And I suppose you were testing my reflexes when you thumped me over the head.
Shadowheart,"I'm alive, yes. Thank you for the concern."
Shadowheart,"What, you didn't think to search me after you knocked me unconscious? I'll let it slide this time - as I owe you my life."
Shadowheart,"Well that's honest of you. Don't do it again - I'll give you a pass this time, considering I owe you my life."
Shadowheart,"No, not while I was out could. I remember a falling sensation - I thought I was dreaming. Next thing I know, I'm here."
Shadowheart,What in Shar's name...? Get away from me you rabid freak! 
Shadowheart,"I remember the ship, I remember falling... then nothing."
Shadowheart,You might want to reconsider calling her a friend - looks like she ran off without us. 
Shadowheart,"You're more concerned for her than she is for you, clearly. We need to take care of ourselves."
Shadowheart,"First things first - we need supplies, shelter, and most of all, a healer."
Shadowheart,"We might have escaped, but we still have these little monsters in our heads. "
Shadowheart,"We need each other, and we both know what's at stake. I can't think of better company."
Shadowheart,You sure about that? Neither of us knows what lies ahead.
Shadowheart,"I can feel it, in your head. You follow someone else's orders. I'll deal with them, not you."
Shadowheart,"I'll join along - if I can speak to whoever's really in charge. Otherwise, I'd best be on my way."
Shadowheart,"One thing, just before we go. I wanted to thank you again, for freeing me... even if you did knock me unconscious afterwards."
Shadowheart,"One thing, just before we go. I wanted to thank you again, for freeing me."
Shadowheart,She must have run off without us... seems like I'm more reliable than your own people.
Shadowheart,Of course. You're the same as me. You have a mind flayer tadpole in your brain.
Shadowheart,The same. It must be that tadpole they put in our eyes. I assume that's what caused our minds to... cross.
Shadowheart,These things are going to consume us from the inside and turn us into mind flayers.
Shadowheart,"Wait. It's you... you're the one who tried to free me, on the ship."
Shadowheart,At least you made the effort.
Shadowheart,Wait. You... you're one of that lot who were attacking the ship.
Shadowheart,"You tried to get my pod open, didn't you?"
Shadowheart,... probably wanted to kill me and loot my corpse. Don't come any closer.
Shadowheart,You'll breath your last before you lay a single finger on me!
Shadowheart,I've seen your kind's handiwork. And I won't fall victim to it. Get away!
Shadowheart,I'm not interested.
Shadowheart,All right... say you didn't leave and we didn't come to blows... what then?
Shadowheart,I suppose there's plenty of other things that're set on killing me around here... 
Shadowheart,... fine. But understand that I'll cut you loose the moment I have to.
Shadowheart,"You asked for this, gith."
Shadowheart,"I don't care what words come out of your mouth, gith. You have your choices."
Shadowheart,"Good. Now keep going, and if you see me again, go the opposite direction."
Shadowheart,"Well, now you can run away again, gith. Keep back!"
Shadowheart,"No matter. Walk away, gith. Not a step closer!"
Shadowheart,Did you forget how we wound up here? Those dragon-riding reavers tried to kill us!
Shadowheart,Never mind... there's bigger problems than your terrible taste in disguises. 
Shadowheart,"Wait... you're that drow I saw on the ship. You survived, then."
Shadowheart,"Wait... it's you. I saw you on the ship. You survived, then."
Shadowheart,Yes. And they put a tadpole in my eye too. I assume that's what caused our minds to... cross.
Shadowheart,But that's the least of our problems.
Shadowheart,What's the matter with you? Has that tadpole scrambled your brain already?
Shadowheart,"It would've been all too easy for you to run right past my pod, but you didn't. I'll remember that."
Shadowheart,Wait - charging off by yourself sounds like a fine way to get killed.
Shadowheart,No... I don't recognise this place. But anything's an improvement on where we just came from.
Shadowheart,"True. Seems like we're the lucky ones, judging by all the corpses strewn about."
Shadowheart,They weren't distinct. Just... this constant onslaught.
Shadowheart,"And even then, only for a moment. Until I got here."
Shadowheart,"Apparently so. They weren't inclined to explain why, just to drive half-berserk."
Shadowheart,"And trust me, I'd love an explanation."
Shadowheart,"No. As long as the voices stay away, I think you're safe."
Shadowheart,But I promise any future murderous intentions will be thoroughly justified.
Shadowheart,"You have nothing to fear from me, so long as the feeling's mutual."
Shadowheart,Remarkably calm for a woman I planned to run through. I can appreciate that.
Shadowheart,Remarkably calm for a man I planned to run through.  I can appreciate that.
Shadowheart,Remarkably calm for someone I planned to run through.  I can appreciate that.
Shadowheart,I'll do what I can. It was difficult to do... anything in that haze.
Shadowheart,You have a tadpole too. I'm the only one who lost her bloody mind.
Shadowheart,I'm not ruling anything out. Unfortunately that doesn't leave me with a lot of firm answers.
Shadowheart,Staying in this camp is making me... restless.
Shadowheart,But I don't want to stray far. I've already learned the consequences the hard way.
Shadowheart,"You I don't mind, but your... kin is another story."
Shadowheart,Nothing. Just an inkling.
Shadowheart,I'm sure things will sort themselves out on the road.
Shadowheart,"Fair enough. But a leader should always keep potential conflicts in mind, yes?"
Shadowheart,Strange bedfellows and such. All right.
Shadowheart,And what does your gith companion have to say about that?
Shadowheart,Yes. Let's get moving.
Shadowheart,"I thought I made myself clear last time - lose the other gith, or there's nothing more to say."
Shadowheart,You should be careful. Plenty would take advantage of that.
Shadowheart,But it seems you've beaten me to it.
Shadowheart,"The forgiving sort, are you?"
Shadowheart,I'll save my gratitude for when I'm cured.
Shadowheart,You... you knocked me out cold. I ought to return the favour - with interest.
Shadowheart,"My head's been in a fog for days. This morning, it cleared away."
Shadowheart,"I'm not much for bowing and scraping, but... thank you."
Shadowheart,I'm sure you have questions.
Shadowheart,Beyond 'Shadowheart'? There's not much to say.
Shadowheart,"I was on my way to Baldur's Gate when that ship appeared. Considering our... shared affliction, I think you know the rest."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps you'll learn more in time then. If we have time, that is."
Shadowheart,We find a healer - fast. We can't have much time left before ceremorphosis takes hold.
Shadowheart,"Baldur's Gate is an obvious answer, but we landed too damn far away."
Shadowheart,I doubt we'd make it in time. There has to be someone else nearby.
Shadowheart,"I would, but you have a lot of hangers-on already. Thin your numbers, then we can talk."
Shadowheart,Even if that gith over there doesn't seem to like me.
Shadowheart,Let's set off. Time is against us.
Shadowheart,"Neither of us agreed to a lot of what's happened lately. Perhaps together, we can change that."
Shadowheart,I'll extend the grace you gave me and pretend that's not a threat.
Shadowheart,"I can be valuable in more ways than you might expect. When you figure out you need me, just say the word."
Shadowheart,"A relative safe haven, I suppose. I'll be here if you need me."
Shadowheart,I... feel better too. Now that the voices are gone.
Shadowheart,But no doubt there's a tadpole squirming in our heads. We have to act.
Shadowheart,They do? I... well. That's curious.
Shadowheart,"I didn't mean... fine. Yes. If you have a cure, then I need it as much as you do."
Shadowheart,"No offence, but my first experience with your kind was one of your dragons nearly roasting me alive."
Shadowheart,And your fellow gith stares at me like she's contemplating how my heart tastes.
Shadowheart,We're not exactly special. There's a lot of bored elves and curious humans out there.
Shadowheart,Are you the one I should actually be speaking to?
Shadowheart,But no luck getting in so far.
Shadowheart,We'll need to find a healer to help us.
Shadowheart,I hope that amulet proves to be worth it...
Shadowheart,The decision is made - no point in regrets now. Let's keep going.
Shadowheart,That Orphic Hammer could be crucial... we may have to try and get our hands on it.
Shadowheart,"Whatever Mizora has in store for you, I doubt it's anything good.<br>"
Shadowheart,Wyll ought to know what happened with Mizora. Whatever she has in store for him can't be good.
Shadowheart,"Karlach. Facing your own mortality in such a... definitive manner must be hard. I'm sorry. If it's any consolation, the rest of us are still liable to perish anyway."
Shadowheart,"Poor Karlach, having to face her own mortality in such a... definitive manner. Though the rest of us are still liable to perish, if it's any consolation."
Shadowheart,What delightful circumstances we find ourselves in. 
Shadowheart,That... creature you turned into. I hope you have it under control. It didn't look like something I'd want to contend with.
Shadowheart,I gave you chances - more than I should have - and you threw them in my face.
Shadowheart,A vampire nest - you truly can find everything in the city. I'd better keep my throat protected...
Shadowheart,Wait... you're the one who left me to die on the ship.
Shadowheart,"No matter. We survived the Hells, survived the crash."
Shadowheart,But we mightn't survive these things in our heads. They're going to consume us from the inside and turn us into mind flayers.
Shadowheart,"I'm sure enough. This is how the mind flayers breed. We host their spawn, and once they're ready, they'll tear right through us."
Shadowheart,"I wish I was being dramatic. This is how the mind flayers breed. We host their spawn, and once they're ready, they'll tear right through us."
Shadowheart,"I'm not sure how much time we have left, but I'm not going to wait to find out."
Shadowheart,You and I need a healer.
Shadowheart,Finding one won't be easy in this wilderness. We'll need supplies.
Shadowheart,But it looks like you've beaten me to it.
Shadowheart,I'm hoping something of use might be behind this door...
Shadowheart,But I've barely made a dent in it so far.
Shadowheart,"I'm not the coward here, flatface."
Shadowheart,"If you can't control yourself, you're nothing but a liability."
Shadowheart,A lot of people died because you lost the run of yourself. Isobel shielded them from the shadows - and you left them vulnerable.
Shadowheart,"Not for me to shed tears over a Selûnite like Isobel, but you condemned a lot of people when you struck her down. People we could have had use of."
Shadowheart,There are many. But they all renounce their gods when they are taught fear. 
Shadowheart,Watch out for that devil.
Shadowheart,And aren't you glad that I am?
Shadowheart,It's an effective trick. Watch out for it. And for Raphael.
Shadowheart,I respect his craft. As should you.
Shadowheart,You clearly can't be trusted.
Shadowheart,I don't know what's worse. A devil or a prying leader.
Shadowheart,I expect we'll be parting company very soon.
Shadowheart,"Do that again and I'll leave you to bleed out in this wilderness, understand?"
Shadowheart,"And watch out for Raphael. He's better at getting into people's heads than you are, you ass."
Shadowheart,Good. You got there eventually.
Shadowheart,"I've made you doubt yourself. Sorry, not what I intended."
Shadowheart,"Let's take time to think about it. Some food and rest, things will be clear then."
Shadowheart,Good. That's what I wanted to hear.
Shadowheart,"I'll tell you in due course. I just wanted to see how close we are in thinking, first of all."
Shadowheart,"I suppose it was a lot to take in. A devil sought us out, teased us with his help..."
Shadowheart,"We can't hedge our bets here. Best we decide how to deal with him, if at all."
Shadowheart,No doubts at all? He seemed powerful and very knowledgeable about our problem...
Shadowheart,Not the worst prospect we've stumbled across. As long as you can look past what he is...
Shadowheart,I thought perhaps you'd be tempted to seize Cazador's prize in his stead... but you didn't. Perhaps that makes you the better man - I'm sure all those people you spared would agree.
Shadowheart,I thought perhaps you'd be tempted to seize Cazador's prize in his stead... but you didn't. Pity - a vampire lord would have been a fine ally... but no matter. It's done.
Shadowheart,Mizora is no more... but we sacrificed Wyll along with her. The Hells have him now.
Shadowheart,"It seems even the Lord of Murder has lost faith in you. I'd offer my commiserations, but, well... I think they might be lost on you."
Shadowheart,"Be my guest, but that door's too strong. Maybe there's another way, up the cliff."
Shadowheart,I was thinking the same thing... around the top of this cliff perhaps. <br>
Shadowheart,Well these things have been giving me plenty of practice. But I'd rather get out of here than push my luck.
Shadowheart,For now. But I'd rather get out of here than keep testing my mettle against these things.
Shadowheart,Don't mistake blood for kinship. 
Shadowheart,I know enough to know I have to keep an eye on you.
Shadowheart,Stick around and you might find out.
Shadowheart,That... is none of your business. I suggest we concentrate on surviving.
Shadowheart,Very funny. And I'm a bugbear. We'll get along just fine.
Shadowheart,Very little. Supposedly those monsters breed by planting their tadpoles in people's heads.
Shadowheart,"Over time, the infected victim turns into a mind flayer."
Shadowheart,"I don't remember how long it takes, but we should hurry."
Shadowheart,Save your breath - I'm going nowhere with you as long as you have that gith in tow.
Shadowheart,Perhaps I'll find your corpse by the road.
Shadowheart,"Go on, then. Just don't be surprised when your friend turns on you."
Shadowheart,"Fine, put your faith in a marauding freak. Just do it away from me."
Shadowheart,"Was that a threat? It was a bit toothless. You're out of your element here, I think."
Shadowheart,"Fine. Try killing a couple of these monsters before you die, gith. Lessens the load for me."
Shadowheart,Likewise. Try killing a couple of these monsters before you die - lessens the load for me.
Shadowheart,It already has. These things here didn't die in their sleep.
Shadowheart,"Apart from my pod, remember? I'm grateful for the effort, but you should save your strength."
Shadowheart,You'll probably break your arm.
Shadowheart,I can handle myself - but you're right. Time to try something else.<br>
Shadowheart,I'm going to see what's at the top of this cliff.
Shadowheart,Conjure ahead.
Shadowheart,"Nobody's talking to you, flatface!"
Shadowheart,"If I were to guess, the things they put in our eyes. "
Shadowheart,"You're a marauder from another world, dolt - of course my name will seem foreign to you. Stay focused."
Shadowheart,"But first, we'll need to survive the wilderness. I'd hoped there might be useful supplies through here."
Shadowheart,Lead the way.
Shadowheart,"Oh no, lead on Gale. I'll follow where the wind blows."
Shadowheart,"No, unless you count these monsters."
Shadowheart,You're the friendliest face so far... which really isn't saying much.
Shadowheart,You're the friendliest face so far.
Shadowheart,Or just company for our final moments.
Shadowheart,But you're right - whatever lies ahead will be a little less daunting with support.
Shadowheart,I might've considered it... but your choice of company so far leaves a great deal to be desired.
Shadowheart,Get rid of the gith. Then we can talk about helping each other.
Shadowheart,"Her kind can't be trusted - they just tried to kill us aboard that ship, after all."
Shadowheart,Must there? You wouldn't expect a wolf and a deer to find a way to work together.
Shadowheart,She'll turn on you. You'll see.
Shadowheart,... this is a terrible idea. But I suppose there is some sense in what you say.
Shadowheart,I'll keep an eye on the gith.
Shadowheart,You can call me Shadowheart.
Shadowheart,Uh-huh... Wyll it is then. Let's move.
Shadowheart,"I saw it, in your head. You follow someone else's orders. I'll deal with them, not you."
Shadowheart,I have to get moving. Perhaps our paths will cross again later. 
Shadowheart,"Oh I'll join you. If you have whoever's in charge alongside you. Otherwise, I'd best be on my way."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps we'll meet again. If you survive, that is."
Shadowheart,You seem overburdened with hangers-on already. 
Shadowheart,Fine. But don't delay.
Shadowheart,"Lead the way. But try anything suspicious and I'll kill you, understand?"
Shadowheart,"I suppose these wilds are a frontier to somewhere... and an extra blade's very welcome. Lead on, Wyll."
Shadowheart,"Lead on then, Lae'zel. Up in front, where I can keep an eye on you."
Shadowheart,"Lead the way, Astarion."
Shadowheart,"...Yes, you're the one. I felt it. I'm told you want company on the journey ahead."
Shadowheart,"The name's Shadowheart, by the way."
Shadowheart,"I can't afford to stay here forever. Time isn't on my side - or yours, for that matter."
Shadowheart,"How gracious of you. Try it again, and I'll leave you in pieces."
Shadowheart,"That said, you're the likeliest ally I've encountered so far. Perhaps we should stay together."
Shadowheart,Bloody maniac!
Shadowheart,What the - you're the one who killed me! Why did you bring me back?
Shadowheart,I'm alive... did you save me?
Shadowheart,Thank you... maybe I should come with you - return the favour by watching your back.
Shadowheart,"I intend to, trust me... On that score, maybe we should stay together - better odds of survival."
Shadowheart,"We've got the same problem, after all. Let's try to find a solution together, before it's too late."
Shadowheart,I can't promise I'll wait forever. Perhaps our paths will cross again later. 
Shadowheart,"I'll join - if I can speak to whoever's really in charge. Otherwise, I'd best be on my way."
Shadowheart,"Seems you're the closest thing to an ally I've encountered so far - we should stay together, in the interest of survival.<br>"
Shadowheart,I often am. Farewell.
Shadowheart,"What happened to the woman I fell for? You've changed, and not for the better."
Shadowheart,"What happened to the person I fell for? You've changed, and not for the better."
Shadowheart,"Sharpen up, or we're done."
Shadowheart,"You know, I was really warming to you - but you've been seriously diminishing my respect for you, of late."
Shadowheart,You're making me regret my decision to join you.
Shadowheart,"I'll remain by your side, but as an ally and nothing more. Keep testing my patience, and I'll leave for good, tadpole be damned."
Shadowheart,You clearly haven't learned. Keep it up and I'm gone. Last warning.
Shadowheart,"We had the beginning of something special, you and I... but no more. You didn't change your ways, even when I warned you."
Shadowheart,Wrong way - we need to get up front!
Shadowheart,Keep going! Get to the transponder!
Shadowheart,"What happened to the man I fell for? You've changed, and not for the better."
Shadowheart,Nothing. You and I ought to be considering how we're going to survive this mess - we should stay together.
Shadowheart,"Well, make sure it's a mistake you don't repeat. I've enough problems with my memory as it is..."
Shadowheart,"Now, instead of killing and resurrecting each other, we should just work together and try to stay alive."
Shadowheart,Fine. Just stay safe. We need each other.
Shadowheart,"No - either we join forces, or you don't go anywhere. Tell me where to find your camp at least."
Shadowheart,"No! The artefact stays with me. And I'll do whatever's necessary to protect it, if I can't make you see reason."
Shadowheart,"Never mind how I got it - just be glad I have it. For now, let's just help each other. What do you say?"
Shadowheart,It stays with me - I'll kill to protect it. Already have.
Shadowheart,"That wouldn't be wise. Even if you managed to get it off of me, do you really think your kin would welcome you with open arms?"
Shadowheart,You're infected - they'll just put you down like a rabid animal. Your best chance is with me.
Shadowheart,"I'll wait here, until you come to your senses. For both our sakes, I hope that happens very soon."
Shadowheart,"Humans, goblins, and many more. It's given them a common purpose, and they're building an army in its name."
Shadowheart,That voice you just felt? It's because of what was done to us - the infection.
Shadowheart,That doesn't matter - what matters is how it can help us against the monsters in our heads.
Shadowheart,Hear me out - your life depends on it. We've both got the same problem... though only I might have the solution.
Shadowheart,"Yes... you're someone I can deal with, I think. I felt it in your head."
Shadowheart,We both have the same problem - the parasites. You won't make it much farther without me. I have an artefact that can protect us until we find a cure.
Shadowheart,Changed your mind yet? I don't think either of us has the luxury of time - not against what we're facing.
Shadowheart,"You need me with you. Let me speak to your leader, and we can press on."
Shadowheart,What the... it's gone! The artefact - what have you done with it?
Shadowheart,Thank you... though you shouldn't have had it to begin with.
Shadowheart,Take what? You don't have it!
Shadowheart,I can't let you do that.
Shadowheart,"Yes. But it'll soon be remedied, once I've taken what's mine from your corpse."
Shadowheart,Wait - you're the one who attacked me! What the hells are you playing at?!
Shadowheart,Well make sure it's a mistake you don't repeat.
Shadowheart,Who put you in charge? I'll trust my own judgement.
Shadowheart,"That could have been me, if you hadn't gotten me out of my pod..."
Shadowheart,How long was I in there...?
Shadowheart,I thought I was going to die in that blasted tube.
Shadowheart,We both need to get off this thing. Let's help each other.
Shadowheart,"Wait - looks like you've a full complement already. We'd make for easy targets, all grouped together like that."
Shadowheart,I think I'll take my chances alone if it's all the same - less conspicuous. Good luck - and thank you.
Shadowheart,"Wait - you're not actually the one in charge of this group, are you? No offence, but I need to speak to a leader. Someone who knows where they're going."
Shadowheart,I'm afraid not. Good luck to you - I'll take my chances alone.
Shadowheart,Gladly. And best of luck. You'll need it.
Shadowheart,One moment.
Shadowheart,It's nothing. Trust me. 
Shadowheart,She's right. Lead on.
Shadowheart,There's no time to spare. Lead the way.
Shadowheart,Shadowheart. One moment...
Shadowheart,"Consider me gone. Maybe I'll see you around - if you survive, that is."
Shadowheart,Not so curious. I've heard what gith are like. Still... you did free me.
Shadowheart,I did... It must be because of those parasites they put in us...
Shadowheart,"We need to deal with that, but first we've to get off this thing... let's join up."
Shadowheart,You keep dangerous company.
Shadowheart,Fair point. Looks like there's plenty of fighting ahead.
Shadowheart,More that gith have a problem with everyone else. But there's more important matters right now - survival.
Shadowheart,They'll have to wait. I need to get off this ship alive first.
Shadowheart,"Let me come with you. We can get off this ship, and watch each other's backs along the way."
Shadowheart,"But that'll have to wait. Are we going to help each other, or not?"
Shadowheart,Are you sure about that? Better odds of surviving if we help each other.
Shadowheart,"I'm used to it. Good luck... and thank you, for your help."
Shadowheart,"I suppose I am. Fitting company for a decidedly odd situation, wouldn't you say?"
Shadowheart,You seem overburdened with hangers-on already.
Shadowheart,We both need all the help we can get. Let's try get off this thing together.
Shadowheart,Sounds in line with what I've heard about your kind. 
Shadowheart,At last... thought I was done for.
Shadowheart,Got to get up. Got to keep moving.
Shadowheart,You! Get me out of this damn thing!
Shadowheart,"Wait! Get me out of here, I can help you!"
Shadowheart,Wait! That can't be. There has to be another way. Please!
Shadowheart,Good - try using it on that machine next to me. 
Shadowheart,Try that contraption just next to the pod - they did something to it when they sealed me in.
Shadowheart,Keep looking!
Shadowheart,"Come on, there's got to be a way to open it!"
Shadowheart,No! Wait!
Shadowheart,What are you waiting for? Get this blasted tube open!
Shadowheart,"Come on, get me out of this thing!"
Shadowheart,"Something the matter? Besides the obvious, that is."
Shadowheart,I'm Shadowheart. Enchanted to meet you - as much as circumstances allow.
Shadowheart,"Pondering my name won't get us off this ship. Let's stow the small talk until we're safe, shall we?"
Shadowheart,"Well, jumping overboard is hardly an option - so that leaves us with taking control of this ship."
Shadowheart,"Provided we can figure out how to do that, of course..."
Shadowheart,I'm right behind you.
Shadowheart,"You're keen to chat, for someone in mortal peril. What's the matter?"
Shadowheart,I thought that damn thing was going to be my coffin. Thank you -
Shadowheart,You're a gith... why did you help me?
Shadowheart,And you expect what in return exactly? Githyanki aren't given to charity.
Shadowheart,That's what your kind does - they take. Still... you did help me.
Shadowheart,"I'm grateful, but don't expect me to be your pawn just because you freed me."
Shadowheart,Damn. We could have helped each other. So be it.
Shadowheart,Bring whoever leads you to speak to me. Then maybe you'll have a hope of survival.
Shadowheart,"There's no chances without me - only certain death, or worse."
Shadowheart,"My blood is the least part of me, drow."
Shadowheart,Now leave me be.
Shadowheart,You helped me - I think I can trust you. But her? She's trouble.
Shadowheart,"No, but I haven't looked either. Staying alive kept me busy."
Shadowheart,This grove is the home of the druid Halsin. Apparently he's a reputed healer.
Shadowheart,He could probably help us. If only he hadn't gone missing.
Shadowheart,My private business. Quit prying.
Shadowheart,A toy. It's not important.
Shadowheart,"Same as you, I suppose. Looking for shelter, supplies... "
Shadowheart,"A healer, in short. Skilled. Discreet. "
Shadowheart,You left me to die.
Shadowheart,How would you know? You didn't even try.
Shadowheart,"You know. You looked me right in the eyes, then left me."
Shadowheart,"No matter. We both survived, for now."
Shadowheart,I'm looking for a cure - starting in this place.
Shadowheart,"Keen to change subject, are you? You weren't so interested last time I tried to get your attention."
Shadowheart,"I thought I might find shelter, supplies - even a healer, perhaps."
Shadowheart,Hmm? What are you doing - 
Shadowheart,"And you ran away as I recall. Left me to die, trapped in that pod."
Shadowheart,"Well, now you can run away again, gith. Keep away from me."
Shadowheart,"I can throw in a few more choice insults if you insist, but I'd rather you just left."
Shadowheart,I've seen your kind's handiwork. And I won't fall victim to it.
Shadowheart,"Maybe I have other reasons. Regardless, stay away from me."
Shadowheart,"I have no idea how long it takes, but I'd rather have a cure sooner than later."
Shadowheart,No. It doesn't matter. I wouldn't trust your kind if a truth spell was stitched into your tongue.
Shadowheart,"That... is none of your business. Let's just concentrate on survival, yes?"
Shadowheart,Right then - lead on.
Shadowheart,What? Who are - 
Shadowheart,What...? You. I remember you. 
Shadowheart,You tried to free me. I couldn't get out until after the ship crashed -
Shadowheart,"You're no gith, at least. I could tell from being in your head."
Shadowheart,And you are? Those dragon-riding reavers tried to kill us.
Shadowheart,Forget it. I've bigger problems than your poor choice of disguises. We both do.
Shadowheart,Please. I felt it.
Shadowheart,There must be a way to reverse what those tentacled freaks did.
Shadowheart,The same. It must be a side effect from what those tentacled freaks did to us.
Shadowheart,There has to be a way to get rid of these parasites.
Shadowheart,I need to find a healer. As do you.
Shadowheart,But yes - you look like a better choice than a band of helpless refugees.
Shadowheart,Get rid of the other gith. Then we can talk about helping each other.
Shadowheart,"For your sake, you ought to nip this in the bud before she turns on you."
Shadowheart,"All right, I'll come with you. I suspect you'll need someone watching your back."
Shadowheart,"...This is a terrible idea. You know that, yes?"
Shadowheart,But I suppose you may have your uses. I can keep an eye on the gith.
Shadowheart,Call me Shadowheart.
Shadowheart,You do that. I'll be here - for now.
Shadowheart,"Fine, see what chance brings you. Perhaps we'll meet again. If you survive, that is."
Shadowheart,You seem overburdened with hangers-on already. You'll just slow me down.
Shadowheart,See me when you've cut the dead weight.
Shadowheart,"Before we go, I wanted to thank you, for freeing me aboard the nautiloid."
Shadowheart,"An extra blade's always welcome. Lead on, Wyll."
Shadowheart,"Cunning people. Private. And very dangerous, at times. Perhaps you'll meet them one day..."
Shadowheart,All right... say we found some miniscule patch of common ground... what then?
Shadowheart,Fine. But understand that I'll cut you loose the moment I have to.
Shadowheart,"Hmm. If you say so. Either way, there's still our little problem to contend with."
Shadowheart,"I thought I made myself clear last time - lose the gith, or there's nothing more to say."
Shadowheart,Hmm... I suppose we can talk some more then.
Shadowheart,There's nothing for me to reconsider - you're the one with the questionable company.
Shadowheart,"I thought I made myself clear last time, gith - keep away from me."
Shadowheart,Just because you say it doesn't mean it's so. Now back off.
Shadowheart,"You're alive! I woke up by the wreckage, surrounded by corpses. I was starting to think I was the only survivor."
Shadowheart,"I haven't forgotten what happened between us, but I also haven't forgotten I'd still be trapped in that pod if it wasn't for you. Let's call it even - we both have bigger concerns."
Shadowheart,Of course. I'd be stuck in a pod - or  worse - if it wasn't for you. Glad to see you're all right. Now maybe we can help one another.
Shadowheart,"We might be clear of those monsters' ship, but we still have their spawn inside our heads. We need to get rid of them while we still can."
Shadowheart,"I'm not helpless. Once I came to, I set out to find some means of surviving: supplies, shelter... and a healer, of course."
Shadowheart,"This was the first sign of friendly life I came across. I hoped I might find supplies, shelter... and a healer, of course."
Shadowheart,What do you want now?
Shadowheart,Spit it out. I won't wait around here forever.
Shadowheart,"And no, I haven't found a cure for our little problem yet, if that's what you were going to ask."
Shadowheart,"You're lucky I managed to catch up with you when I did - we're both lucky, in fact."
Shadowheart,I'm Shadowheart - we were on the nautiloid together. We've both got the same problem... though only I might have the solution.
Shadowheart,"I don't know how, but this artefact is protecting me from whoever controls our parasites. You won't get much farther without it shielding you, trust me."
Shadowheart,"We share a common goal - getting rid of the tadpoles. Seems you've come to the same conclusion as I did, that these Absolute cultists are involved in some way. Only sensible that we help one another."
Shadowheart,You need me at your side.
Shadowheart,"I can't afford to get rid of it, but I can't protect it alone either. I'm lucky to have made it this far."
Shadowheart,Very. So what do you say?
Shadowheart,"Make it fast. And don't even think of venturing far without me, or it'll be your last bad decision."
Shadowheart,"Fair point. Survival is the crux of it, for now."
Shadowheart,I suppose you gith know something about these things...
Shadowheart,So again - what are you doing here?
Shadowheart,"Too many tieflings - don't cause trouble. Anyway, it was just a figure of speech."
Shadowheart,I've seen how your kind solves problems - with swords and dragonfire.
Shadowheart,Lay one finger on me and you'll breath your last. I promise.
Shadowheart,Good. Now keep your distance.
Shadowheart,"I don't care what you have to say, gith. Back off."
Shadowheart,Try teaching me some manners then. See what it gets you.
Shadowheart,"Unless you're going to say 'I'll be leaving', I'm not interested."
Shadowheart,Some crude scratches in the metal doesn't make it yours.
Shadowheart,"Stay out of my business, and stay away from me."
Shadowheart,"No matter. Walk away, gith. We have nothing to discuss."
Shadowheart,"...why are you disguised as a gith, idiot? I could've killed you."
Shadowheart,I suppose you came here for the same reason I did...
Shadowheart,"I don't think so. You need a healer, same as I do."
Shadowheart,"Of course, but what you really need - what both of us need - is a healer."
Shadowheart,Precisely. We need some who can help rid us of these things.
Shadowheart,"But we'll have no such luck in this place, from what I've learned of it."
Shadowheart,I didn't ask for you to -
Shadowheart,Huh...? What are you - 
Shadowheart,None of your business! Now -
Shadowheart,I thought I'd seen the last of you.
Shadowheart,"Start another fight, and I'll finish it."
Shadowheart,"If I wanted a tail, I'd kill a cat.<br>"
Shadowheart,"I'm not looking for hunting advice, gith. I'm looking to be left alone."
Shadowheart,Calm yourself. It was a hypothetical.
Shadowheart,"It's a hypothetical. At present, I have no particular need to kill a cat."
Shadowheart,See? Sowing doubt is an old trick. Watch out for it. And for Raphael.
Shadowheart,"Unless I'm wrong, of course."
Shadowheart,Perhaps you didn't.
Shadowheart,My Lady Shar is the Nightsinger. The patron of darkness and loss.
Shadowheart,Hrmph. Only if you lack foresight and imagination.
Shadowheart,"The night brings comfort. Through loss, we find acceptance. In the arms of the Dark Mother we find peace."
Shadowheart,"Most fear the dark, like children, because in darkness they see their fears reflected."
Shadowheart,But Shar teaches us to step beyond fear. Beyond loss. In darkness we do not hide - we act.
Shadowheart,Pain. Hope. The promise of better days. All of these are heavy cloaks that bend our backs and burden our hearts.
Shadowheart,"We shed those cloaks. Before Shar we stand gloriously naked, beyond the vanities of mortals. "
Shadowheart,Give it time - and thought.
Shadowheart,"There's comfort, yes. But often there has to be pain beforehand..."
Shadowheart,"We tear down the lies the world is drunk on: the institutions they trust, the so-called gods they worship. The lives they cling to."
Shadowheart,I assume you've heard of her?
Shadowheart,"We destroy false idols, topple corrupt organisations, fight heretics wherever they're found."
Shadowheart,"Well if that troubles you, perhaps you should fetch the bailiff to arrest me..."
Shadowheart,"...ah, but there's no bailiff here, is there? Just leagues of wilderness and the dangers lurking within."
Shadowheart,"We're in this together, but I'll happily go it alone. My faith will keep me company."
Shadowheart,Curious. Most are afraid of my Lady.
Shadowheart,I think I did well by joining you. Most agreeable company.
Shadowheart,Perhaps you'll turn out to be a worthy companion after all.
Shadowheart,"I didn't expect to see eye to eye with you on this. A pleasant surprise, I'll admit."
Shadowheart,You're wiser than most. Many people balk at our doctrine - it's the reason why we cherish secrecy.
Shadowheart,You've a habit of saying all the right things. Either you're very glib or we're kindred spirits.
Shadowheart,"Maybe both, knowing myself. But yes. Once we've saved ourselves, we can talk more on this."
Shadowheart,There's often suffering - death even. Many people break before they embrace Shar's truths.
Shadowheart,"As you worship Selûne, I assume you know of her twin?"
Shadowheart,I am indeed a disciple of Shar - Mistress of the Night and Lady of Loss.
Shadowheart,Very well. Perhaps there's potential in you. Let's see how you handle this.
Shadowheart,... yes. I am honoured with her blessing.
Shadowheart,Not this again. I told you already - forget it.
Shadowheart,I don't know what you mean.
Shadowheart,It's nothing. Really.
Shadowheart,"All right. As I said, Shar is my patron, my mistress. Goddess of darkness and loss."
Shadowheart,What kind of question is that? Of course I am. Are you?
Shadowheart,"What makes you think I'm hiding anything? If I've something to share, I'll let you know."
Shadowheart,"Fine, I'll tell you, so long as it spares me your ham-fisted threats."
Shadowheart,Like I told you before; you'll know if I have anything to tell you.
Shadowheart,"What, not trying to threaten a confession out of me this time? You'll know if I have anything to tell you."
Shadowheart,"What, now you're resorting to threats? The answer's the same as before - you'll know if I have anything to tell you."
Shadowheart,"More hot air and empty threats. When I want you to know something, I'll tell you."
Shadowheart,"You're persistent; I'll give you that. But I'll decide what I share, or don't."
Shadowheart,"Not a fast learner, are you? My affairs are my own; I won't be coerced by you."
Shadowheart,What makes you think threats will get you what you want? I've nothing to say to you.
Shadowheart,"Are you sure? You've utterly failed so far. If I have something to tell you, I'll do so when I want to."
Shadowheart,"You truly will not give up, will you? I admire your tenacity, if not your powers of persuasion..."
Shadowheart,All right... you've suffered enough for me to risk a little candour.
Shadowheart,I'm sure you do. But please try to understand that it's not something I can just talk about freely.
Shadowheart,"You're straight to the point, at least. But still, I'm not sure you are ready for Shar's teachings. Not yet, at least."
Shadowheart,I don't have to explain myself to you.
Shadowheart,"Then reconsider, if you're sure you can survive without me."
Shadowheart,Fine. Just keep out matters that don't concern you.
Shadowheart,"You surprise me. And not in a negative sense, I must admit."
Shadowheart,You surprise me - pleasantly. Perhaps I misjudged you.
Shadowheart,"Perhaps once we've saved ourselves from the tadpoles, we can talk more on this."
Shadowheart,I had hoped you might be tactful enough to not pick at that particular scab. Seems I was mistaken.
Shadowheart,I'll look forward to the next 'last kiss'. And the one after that.
Shadowheart,"You're doing what's necessary, for all of us. That's why I've been by your side this whole time."
Shadowheart,"Honestly? I think self-reflection may be the enemy just now. I can't afford to lose my nerve. Safer to just not think, and keep forging ahead."
Shadowheart,"Let's just stay shoulder to shoulder, and see this through."
Shadowheart,"High Hall. There's nowhere else to go... This is where it all ends, my love."
Shadowheart,High Hall. There's nowhere else to go... This is where it all ends.
Shadowheart,It's about time Halsin actually stepped up and joined us properly - he's certainly been taking up space at camp for long enough.
Shadowheart,Lae'zel has a dangerous look in her eyes - let's just hope she reserves those impulses for any common foes.
Shadowheart,"Mystra has forsaken Gale entirely. Imagine how he must be feeling... I doubt I could go on, if Lady Shar turned on me."
Shadowheart,"This place... there's a power in these shadows, I can sense it. It's ancient, familiar..."
Shadowheart,We're still in this fight. Time we got higher.
Shadowheart,"My orders were to keep the artefact safe, not pry into it... but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious as to what exactly it's hiding..."
Shadowheart,"I thought I was the one most burdened with secrets - seems I was very mistaken. All this time we've been fighting and fleeing from the Absolute, and we've one of their figureheads in our midst."
Shadowheart,"But I can hardly hold that against you - you seemed as surprised as I was. If you're able to resist your urges, then surely you can resist the lure of past allegiances also."
Shadowheart,The Gauntlet of Shar... I can't believe it. I can't believe we found the Dark Lady's sacred crucible.
Shadowheart,"Overwhelming. Worship of Lady Shar is usually discreet by nature. Her holy sites have to be modest, well-hidden. But that place... I never knew such grandeur had been built in her honour."
Shadowheart,"I know. I can scarcely believe it's real, but I saw it with my own eyes, felt the polished stone walls raised in Lady Shar's honour..."
Shadowheart,"Normally it would not be for me to pursue becoming a Dark Justiciar without a superior's command, but this is different. My lady wanted me to find this place, I know it."
Shadowheart,"The Gauntlet of Shar is no ordinary temple - it is the highest test of the Dark Lady's faithful, to judge if they are worthy of becoming a Dark Justiciar."
Shadowheart,"The Gauntlet has double meaning - it speaks of the ordeals to be overcome, and of the armour-clad fist of Lady Shar that would embrace the worthy. Survive the crushing gauntlet, and be embraced by the Nightsinger at its very core."
Shadowheart,"The old ways were lost over time - now some claim the rank simply by killing a single Selûnite. But before, they were a true elite. Many would attempt the trials, but few would succeed."
Shadowheart,He slew Lady Shar's children - by rights I should avenge them and cut that ugly head right off his thick neck... but I'm no fool either. Picking a fight with him would be a distraction - a potentially fatal one.
Shadowheart,He's a pompous sack of spare parts. He and his undead lackeys should never have come here. Perhaps I can rid Lady Shar's gauntlet of them yet...
Shadowheart,"Hardly. We're going to win this, understand? But no sense missing the opportunity..."
Shadowheart,Lady Shar's blessings to you. Or perhaps you don't need them - you look well.
Shadowheart,"The belly of the beast. The sooner we kill this thing, the better."
Shadowheart,"Good. Something for us to look forward to, once all's said and done."
Shadowheart,"My Lady and your moonwitch are at war, so naturally we're enemies... but enemies with a common purpose, for now. "
Shadowheart,"As long as we have use for each other, I can bite my tongue and stay my blade. I don't see what more needs to be said on the matter."
Shadowheart,I suppose some would consider such diplomacy a virtue. Others might just see it as a lack of will.
Shadowheart,"But I suppose there's no harm in learning about the opposition - though I doubt there's much to learn. You Selûnites are coddled, decadent, drunk on hope. Fattened calves, ready for sacrifice."
Shadowheart,Is this because of what I shared with you? My memory of being saved from the wolf? You're clutching at straws.
Shadowheart,We've spoken enough of this. I cannot allow your misguided beliefs to poison my mind.
Shadowheart,How so? Are you taught to churn your own butter while barely out of swaddling?
Shadowheart,Nothing Selûne asks of you can compare to the tests that Lady Shar's children endure.
Shadowheart,"What, you think frolicking in the woods by moonlight amounts to a test? That's nothing. That's just... a childish thing. I don't want to hear any more of it."
Shadowheart,"Trust me, I am endlessly grateful to not know Selûne."
Shadowheart,"If you're attempting to goad me, don't bother. I'm more than familiar with those sort of tricks."
Shadowheart,That may be the wisest thing you've ever said.
Shadowheart,You're good company - I'll admit it. I'm sorry you're hindered by that supposed goddess.
Shadowheart,But whatever you and I think of each other means little. We stand in opposition - our goddesses have determined it.
Shadowheart,"You're better company than I would expect, for a Selûnite. Don't let it go to your head, though."
Shadowheart,"Like oil complements an open flame, perhaps. "
Shadowheart,"I think we're done here. I'll certainly be glad to see the back of it, anyway..."
Shadowheart,"There I was, thinking we were finally about to put an end to all this. Too good to be true, I suppose."
Shadowheart,I suppose we can't claim to be shocked - the Emperor's wanted us to embrace our powers the whole time. This is the logical final step.
Shadowheart,"I'd offer to take the plunge, but, well... somehow, I don't think Lady Shar would approve of a mind flayer leading her flock."
Shadowheart,"You're the only one who can make this decision. And whatever you choose, I'll be by your side."
Shadowheart,"I... I can't face the thought of it myself, though. I've only just been able to start living on my own terms... I can't surrender that. "
Shadowheart,I'll need a long soak in a bath to rid myself of the feeling of this place. Can I count on you to scrub my back?
Shadowheart,If you like. Good thing your practical streak is one of the things I love about you.
Shadowheart,"Most, perhaps. But I can hardly be paying compliments to my lady's competition now, can I?"
Shadowheart,I couldn't agree more. Lady Shar's holy work is all-consuming - I doubt I'd manage without a feather bed to turn to.
Shadowheart,"Very much so. I couldn't bear to miss it, no matter how busy Lady Shar's work keeps me."
Shadowheart,"And what better to revel in, than Lady Shar's umbral bliss? Just be careful to not overindulge - drain too many maidens and young bucks, and you may find a mob breaking down your door."
Shadowheart,"But I'll leave such notions for the bards to pick over - not appropriate for someone of my standing to indulge in sentiment. Or at least, not often."
Shadowheart,"It's good that you two have each other. Fitting perhaps; you left there a hunter and quarry, and return as allies and friends."
Shadowheart,"I'm sure you have no shortage of challenges there. I can only imagine what your trophy wall must look like - assuming you keep trophies. Or have a wall, for that matter."
Shadowheart,"And building up quite the reputation for yourself as well, no doubt? I've seen more than a few children playing as you on the streets, brandishing sticks at each other."
Shadowheart,"People never talk about just how exhausting power can be, do they? But I'm glad the city has you as a steadying influence - just don't solve all its problems, or I'll be short of new recruits."
Shadowheart,"Mmm, yes. Shy is indeed not a word I'd reach for, when it comes to her. I'm glad the city has you as a steadying influence - just don't solve all its problems, or I'll be short of new recruits."
Shadowheart,"I should hope not - if any city-sized craters should appear in Faerûn, I'll know who to blame."
Shadowheart,"Helping shape the minds of future generations, is it? Just be sure to steer them far away from dabbling in Netherese magic..."
Shadowheart,"I might need a few more of those, before the sun threatens to rise."
Shadowheart,"Hmm. I might have to call on you to trouble me again, before the night runs its course."
Shadowheart,"I won't forget that in a hurry - which is truly saying something, coming from me."
Shadowheart,"I can sympathise, truly."
Shadowheart,I suppose you may.
Shadowheart,That's the sort of trouble I live for.
Shadowheart,"Luckily for both of us, I'm well-versed in stealth. Come here..."
Shadowheart,"My, I think you've gotten stronger."
Shadowheart,I should be careful - it'd be all too easy to get lost in those arms.
Shadowheart,Hmm. I think I needed that more than I realised.
Shadowheart,Well it'd be cruel of me to deny you...
Shadowheart,"I suppose I can't deny you, given how often I've spoken of Lady Shar's embrace..."
Shadowheart,Very well. Just don't squeeze the breath out of me.
Shadowheart,They can challenge me on the matter if they dare... though none are so bold.
Shadowheart,There's great virtue in stealth. Perhaps you can help train some of my initiates in the future. I can repay you in any juicy morsels who fail to pass muster.
Shadowheart,"Sometimes she fears the others will grow jealous; that I see her as a favourite - well it's true, I do. "
Shadowheart,"Not in the slightest, no. But I am glad to hear it, nonetheless."
Shadowheart,"Don't worry - even the most lost souls will find their way to Lady Shar's embrace, in the end."
Shadowheart,"What can I say? We shared something extraordinary, even if we didn't always see eye to eye. Let's leave old squabbles in the past."
Shadowheart,You can say that with a straight face after all the times I had to come to your aid?
Shadowheart,"In all likelihood, it will be... but we mustn't let that stop us."
Shadowheart,Honestly? So have I.
Shadowheart,"I suppose it can't be easy making friends amongst the gods, being the pantheon's newest arrival."
Shadowheart,I was starting to wonder if you'd show up.
Shadowheart,"So modest. You and I both know your visage is a mark of pride - it denotes fearlessness, tenacity, a capacity for self-sacrifice that would make most hearts quake."
Shadowheart,I have little doubt. But you can give your sword arm a rest - tonight is for celebrating.
Shadowheart,Nobility suits you. I've been sure to keep some discreet eyes on your progress - their reports have been very complimentary.
Shadowheart,So I have heard - just be sure to keep it far from Lady Shar's holy work. Even the sharpest blade can be dulled against her power.
Shadowheart,"And suits the populace, I daresay. They've probably had their fill of butchered corpses in the streets."
Shadowheart,Perish the thought. You are right to look the part - I know the importance of appearances in maintaining your grasp of power all too well.
Shadowheart,"I think we both know the darkness is far superior anyway. Besides, the flicker of candlelight truly brings out your cheekbones."
Shadowheart,"Well, you pull it off admirably, I must admit. I'm sure you'll find plenty who'll fawn at the idea of a romantic fugitive."
Shadowheart,"You may very well be right. Perhaps you'll become the subject of books in years to come, rather than the avid consumer of them."
Shadowheart,I'm glad you managed to pull yourself away from your leatherbound harem then. 
Shadowheart,"How... descriptive of you. But I suppose that counts as thriving, by your yardstick."
Shadowheart,"Coming from you, that's high praise. The continent ought to be flattered."
Shadowheart,"And at the risk of sounding boastful, I think we have plenty to celebrate; Lady Shar's entire church prospers. The Absolute washed the Sword Coast with blood and tears - it is now fertile ground for her message to flourish."
Shadowheart,"Oh, do not fear them - there's no point in fearing the inevitable. "
Shadowheart,Intriguing. Yet I hope your ambitions don't grow so great that we find ourselves at odds. I would hate for you to force my hand for the sake of Lady Shar's interests.
Shadowheart,Understandable. But rest assured that your secret is safe with me. Lady Shar respects those who live in the shadows.
Shadowheart,"Can you blame them? It must be like meeting their literary hero - or anti-hero, I suppose."
Shadowheart,I have little doubt. Only the strongest of hearts could endure such challenges and maintain even a sliver of your good cheer.
Shadowheart,"Overawed, of course... but I have scarce time to saviour the majesty of Lady Shar's domain - there is yet work to be done, in her name."
Shadowheart,"Almost as busy as I am - such rapid growth creates a good deal of work for a quartermaster. So many lost souls, in need of dark cloaks... she has risen to the occasion though, as I knew she would."
Shadowheart,"A future in which she was discarded, where the reward for her service and sacrifice was to groom her own replacement?"
Shadowheart,"You did, and I'll be forever grateful. I'll keep Lady Shar's followers away from your nascent church for as long as I can... give you a sporting chance."
Shadowheart,"Let's keep that our special secret. I have a reputation to maintain, you know."
Shadowheart,You're lucky none of my followers are around to witness this. Come here...
Shadowheart,"What, a show of sincere affection...?"
Shadowheart,"Like a rare vintage... bittersweet to taste so infrequently, yet always worth the wait."
Shadowheart,I'd like to think I'm cunning enough to get away with it. Come here to me...
Shadowheart,"Now, tell me all. What have you been doing with yourself this past while?"
Shadowheart,"At least let's enjoy tonight, then I can leave you be once more. In time, you will feel the old yearning again, and darken my door."
Shadowheart,"You didn't seem to be of that mind when we last slipped away together. You couldn't get enough of me, as I recall."
Shadowheart,But let's not grow maudlin - this is a celebration. Tell me what you've been doing with yourself.
Shadowheart,"I jest. You would think I'd be accustomed to loss, yet it stings all the same. Lady Shar may keep me occupied, but there is always a place in my heart and mind for you."
Shadowheart,"I don't know if that's strictly true... I think I saw just about every inch of you, when I last slipped away from my duties..."
Shadowheart,"... And tonight, of all nights, was made for indulgence."
Shadowheart,"But don't worry. I'm sure you'll find there's still plenty to like, if you care to indulge..."
Shadowheart,"Nor are you the same person who fell for me. Time can be unkind to hearts in that sense, especially if you fear change.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Nor are you the same woman who fell for me. Time can be unkind to hearts in that sense, especially if you fear change.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Nor are you the same man who fell for me. Time can be unkind to hearts in that sense, especially if you fear change."
Shadowheart,"We would have been able to claim just enough of each other's hearts in order for it to hurt. Better to indulge ourselves fully whenever fate allows, than to live in compromise..."
Shadowheart,"A pity, yes... but also for the best, perhaps. It would have pained me to have you close, but not be able to dedicate myself to you in every waking moment."
Shadowheart,You should see how they flock to us. We spread like the night sky chasing the sun below the horizon.
Shadowheart,"Broken hearts, shaken faiths, refugees without homes, former cultists without purpose... they can all become the Nightsinger's children, with the right nudge."
Shadowheart,Very apt choice of words. But it doesn't just go for me; Lady Shar's entire church prospers. The Absolute washed the Sword Coast with blood and tears - it is now fertile ground for her message to flourish.
Shadowheart,Her entire church prospers. The Absolute washed the Sword Coast with blood and tears - it is now fertile ground for her message to flourish.
Shadowheart,"You did, and I'll be forever grateful. Perhaps one day, you may open your eyes to her wisdom yourself... but even if you do not, I shall make sure that the sharp edge of her spreading gospel does not trouble you."
Shadowheart,"What transpired was the Dark Lady's will. If time rolled back, I would do the same thing all over again, without hesitation... yet I am not without sympathy."
Shadowheart,"You have worshippers of your own, Gale. Are you really in a position to judge? I'd have expected the god of ambition to understand that you must do whatever it takes."
Shadowheart,"If those people didn't come to me, who knows where they'd end up? Lady Shar provides food, shelter, training, purpose... and the wisdom  that one day, their pain will no longer matter."
Shadowheart,"I came to see her as an adversary, an obstacle, but what recourse did she have? What did she see when she looked at me?"
Shadowheart,"I shouldn't... but from time to time, yes. Holding the office she once held, standing within the shadow of Lady Shar herself... It complicates my feelings towards her."
Shadowheart,"Simplicity is a luxury that's drifted out of my reach, I'm afraid. But at least for tonight, I can have a taste of how it used to be."
Shadowheart,"All-consuming. Endless decisions to make, underlings jockeying for your attention, threats from the outside, threats from the inside... there's times I miss when it was just our little group against the odds."
Shadowheart,Would that I could. But this is my life now. Lady Shar must come first - always.
Shadowheart,"And should one thing lead to another, well... we all deserve to be wicked, now and again."
Shadowheart,I've got my own private wine cellar now - I'll keep a special vintage aside for your visit.
Shadowheart,"Oh you're far too cunning to fall for that. Consider Lady Shar's cloister your safe sanctuary, for as long as it answers to me."
Shadowheart,"But don't be such a stranger either, in future. You know where to find me - I can always make some time for an old friend. One of the privileges of being in charge."
Shadowheart,"But don't be such a stranger either, in future. Should Withers grant you leave from Avernus, you'll know where to find me - I can always make some time for an old friend. One of the privileges of being in charge."
Shadowheart,"I suppose you'll be keen to do the rounds, with so many old acquaintances gathered. Do not let me hoard your time."
Shadowheart,"I suppose you'll be keen to do the rounds, with your time here being so short. Do not let me hoard your attention."
Shadowheart,But no matter - I'm quite content to let her ranks of minions dwindle against the edge of your blade.
Shadowheart,You would think Vlaakith would understand by now that it would take more than a few cutthroats to best you. 
Shadowheart,"No interest in a little respite then? I won't claim to be surprised - you never struck me as the sort to rest on her laurels, Lae'zel."
Shadowheart,"Ooh, you utter tease. I suppose I, of all people, can't begrudge you your secrets."
Shadowheart,You've been busy! Careful you don't pull a muscle - I'm not there to nurse you back to health any more.
Shadowheart,I won't pretend I'm not a little jealous. Lady Shar is a demanding mistress - as is her right to be - but a little calm and solitude would be a tonic.
Shadowheart,"Well I'd wish you luck, but my lady may not appreciate me encouraging the competition."
Shadowheart,"Apart from give closure to a former lover, perhaps? Don't worry - I'm not upset. Lady Shar would likely have prised us away from each other even if you had remained."
Shadowheart,But enough of that for now - I won't have it said that I'm not capable of enjoying a fine night with good company. Tell me what you've been doing.
Shadowheart,Sorry. Every gathering is an opportunity when you're doing the Dark Lady's work.
Shadowheart,They have already been tempered by loss. They were meant to become her instruments.
Shadowheart,"Everyone is exploited. Lowest gutter to highest throne, there's always someone above you pulling the strings. If you think otherwise, you aren't looking hard enough."
Shadowheart,"Trust me, I'll keep up. "
Shadowheart,I... I don't know. Lady Shar expects me to act without question... but I need to think. I need to be sure this is what I want.
Shadowheart,This place is quite something. I just hope it doesn't spring a leak.
Shadowheart,"Karlach has offered to take on the duty. She doesn't have much time left, so there's a certain logic in leaving this to her. A somewhat callous logic, mind you."
Shadowheart,"Karlach has offered to take on the duty. She doesn't have much time left, so there's a certain logic in leaving this to her. The Dark Lady would approve, I'm sure."
Shadowheart,"If... if you're sure. This is not a decision to make in haste, but you have my support, either way."
Shadowheart,Very well. Let's do all we can to help her.
Shadowheart,I see... then I hope she understands. But I trust your judgement.
Shadowheart,"Whatever you choose to do, you can count on my support."
Shadowheart,I understand your determination. But we still need a decision.
Shadowheart,If you think that's for the best... but I just hope the Emperor doesn't betray our trust.
Shadowheart,"Very well. Whatever happens, I shall stand by you."
Shadowheart,"That's Orin dealt with - good riddance. Now that we have her Netherstone, we're one big step closer to finishing this, once and for all."
Shadowheart,This isn't over yet - we need to pursue Ketheric Thorm.
Shadowheart,"Just our luck to find an inn, only for it to be burning to the ground."
Shadowheart,You... you sacrificed your own father? I hope freedom from the pact was worth it.
Shadowheart,"Wyll sacrificed his own father to be free of the pact. Remarkable resolve, if you can harden your heart. The Nightsinger would approve."
Shadowheart,Wyll sacrificed his own father... I hope freedom from the pact is worth it to him.
Shadowheart,"An infestation of vampire spawn - that's just about the last thing I wanted to wake up to. We thwarted their efforts to seize Astarion, at least."
Shadowheart,This place seems ancient. It must predate everything on the surface. I wonder what it was like in its heyday.
Shadowheart,We can't just let Orin take one of our own - even if it's Lae'zel. We have to rescue her... or kill Gortash in order to win her freedom.
Shadowheart,I'll never be able to look at a butcher shop again after this place. But at least we were afforded a soft landing.
Shadowheart,"Defying a goddess, Gale? Well, they do say imitation is a form of flattery. I just hope you know what you're doing."
Shadowheart,"Defying a goddess, Gale? Bold, but Mystra was never worthy of your love."
Shadowheart,"So Cazador wishes to ascend at your expense? Somehow, I doubt you intend to accept that meekly."
Shadowheart,"You sacrificed your own father, Wyll? Not a step that many could take, but the Nightsinger would appreciate your resolve, I think."
Shadowheart,"We need to make a decision - if anyone's to become a mind flayer, perhaps it should be Karlach. She's doomed either way."
Shadowheart,The shadows are losing their grip on these lands - Shar can indeed be thwarted. Comforting to know.
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar's power will soon fade from these lands, but it is a price that had to be paid, so that the traitor Ketheric Thorm could face justice at last."
Shadowheart,"So, only a mind flayer can wield the stones, from what the Emperor said. And not a part-illithid either - the full-blown thing."
Shadowheart,"So, only a mind flayer can wield the stones, from what the Emperor said. "
Shadowheart,What do you think?
Shadowheart,If you say so. But we still need a decision.
Shadowheart,"So, the githyanki have no cure for our condition - unless you count death as a cure. I won't pretend to be surprised."
Shadowheart,"So, you're free from your hunger, free from any lingering fear of the sun... but all those lives you sacrificed, Astarion. I'm not sure I'll forget their final screams any time soon."
Shadowheart,"'Vampire Ascendant'. A fine prize, Astarion, paid for with a sea of blood. I'm glad to know I have an ally who understands the value of sacrifice - congratulations."
Shadowheart,Gale defied Mystra herself. Good - not every goddess is deserving of such love. I would know.
Shadowheart,"I don't know how exactly Orin managed to spirit away someone as big as Halsin, but we have to get him back - either via a rescue, or Gortash's death."
Shadowheart,"Karlach... you must have a lot to think about, just now. If you need time to yourself, take it."
Shadowheart,"Poor Karlach. All this way, just to be faced with a dead end - literally. I can't imagine how she feels."
Shadowheart,"What happened to that magical item, Gale...?"
Shadowheart,This place makes my skin crawl. Don't take anything for granted in here.
Shadowheart,Gale's back on his feet - good. We've got enough problems as it is without him dead as well.
Shadowheart,Minsc - he seemed to believe that doppelganger was truly Jaheira. A sure sign he's being manipulated.
Shadowheart,"I know you have your personal demons to contend with... but if I didn't make it clear before, I think you can beat this. Just don't give in, and seek help if you need it."
Shadowheart,"A cruel end. I wouldn't have wished that for Zevlor, no matter his failings."
Shadowheart,"We're in decidedly unfamiliar territory now - keep up the pressure, and stay alert. We need to find Thorm."
Shadowheart,"Astarion. You seem remarkably hale and hearty, in spite of all we're facing. The itinerant lifestyle must suit you."
Shadowheart,"An imposter in our ranks... if this is true, it could be anyone. You, me... well, not me - I know who I am. "
Shadowheart,"Perhaps we shouldn't take Gortash's word for granted... but if he speaks the truth, we need to be careful. Orin could have eyes and ears on us right now."
Shadowheart,"That temper of yours is a sight to behold. You'll need to be careful, or your rage will burn right through you."
Shadowheart,"Karlach's temper is a sight to behold. She'll need to be careful, or that rage will burn her right out."
Shadowheart,So Cazador wishes to ascend at Astarion's expense? Somehow I can't see our fanged friend accepting that meekly.
Shadowheart,"I never thought I'd see the Gauntlet of Shar for myself. In fact, part of me wondered if it was actually real."
Shadowheart,"The Orphic Hammer is ours - which means we could free Orpheus, if we wish."
Shadowheart,"I'm sorry that happened to you, Wyll - that bat-winged slattern deserves to meet the business end of a poo-scraper."
Shadowheart,No matter. We've dealt with every other oddity thrown at us lately - we can handle this one too.
Shadowheart,"Now, as for this 'Raphael'..."
Shadowheart,"He knows our secret, he claims he can help... what do you make of him?"
Shadowheart,"Oh you were tempted, were you? Interesting."
Shadowheart,"What grabbed you, exactly? His parlour tricks? His manners? The lavish spread, even?"
Shadowheart,"You must have found something alluring, to overlook the fact he was a devil."
Shadowheart,"You know, failing to make a decision is the same as making a decision..."
Shadowheart,... except you decide blindly.
Shadowheart,My point is that Raphael was stirring the pot - trying to unsettle us.
Shadowheart,Hmm. Or is it? Suddenly I'm not so sure... 
Shadowheart,... isn't it terrible when someone causes you to doubt yourself?
Shadowheart,Your opinions are easily swayed. Should I wait for them to change again?
Shadowheart,Perhaps you're right. Perhaps a devil has our best interests at heart and wants nothing in return.
Shadowheart,We could throw ourselves at his feet - be they cloven or otherwise. Or perhaps we shouldn't.
Shadowheart,"Your gullibility would be endearing, if it didn't lead us into danger."
Shadowheart,Bravo - you had me worried for a moment.
Shadowheart,Clearly. And do you know what? I think that's just what that devil intended.
Shadowheart,I assume you are joking.
Shadowheart,"Actually... yes, you're right. Very intuitive. Clearly the devil was trying to sow doubt among us."
Shadowheart,He's clever. My order uses the same tactic when dealing with enemies of Shar.
Shadowheart,I know people who work much like our new acquaintance does.
Shadowheart,You don't need a scourge or a rack to break people. Fear and self-doubt are sufficient.
Shadowheart,"When actual pain comes, the victim's already done the heavy lifting for their torturer."
Shadowheart,"I've heard you can't get blood from a stone, but apparently you can get a wizard from one. Gale seems interesting."
Shadowheart,"The Netherbrain's lair must be close. This could all be over very soon, one way or another..."
Shadowheart,This place reeks of madness and murder - I can almost feel it in the rotten air.
Shadowheart,Astarion's an interesting find. Let's hope any future acquaintances don't hold a blade to your throat by way of introduction.
Shadowheart,"But if it's any consolation, the new look is rather rugged..."
Shadowheart,The Underdark... as if we didn't face enough dangers back up on the surface.
Shadowheart,"So, a deal's been struck with Raphael at least. He certainly drew out his sales pitch for long enough."
Shadowheart,I hope Mizora flies into the blades of a windmill for what she did to Wyll... though I must admit the new look is a little dashing...
Shadowheart,So Astarion didn't fulfil his master's ambitions for himself. At least that means he's his own man... though I'm a little surprised he didn't covet those powers.
Shadowheart,"Minthara with child... Somehow I can't picture her sitting around the campfire, knitting baby booties..."
Shadowheart,"Boo seems like a worthy addition to our group. His pet, Minsc, may prove useful also."
Shadowheart,Shar's power still grips this land. A shame we could not banish it - it would have felt good to spite her.
Shadowheart,"This land remains cloaked by Lady Shar's power - good. A shame it cost us Halsin as a travelling companion though. He may have been misguided, but I liked looking at him."
Shadowheart,That's the last of Raphael. I'll be glad to no longer have to suffer his smug face. 
Shadowheart,"Not the cheeriest of inns, this place. But I suppose the mortal peril lurking just past the firelight is liable to put a dampener on the mood."
Shadowheart,"Minsc is dead, Jaheria is gone... We've lost ourselves some powerful allies, I fear. Let's just hope we still have enough strength to see this through."
Shadowheart,Karlach... that was a decidedly mixed blessing you received. My sympathies... but at least you can seek comfort now.
Shadowheart,Poor Karlach. She can finally seek out the touch of another... only to be told she might not have much time left.
Shadowheart,"The crèche... it's nothing but rubble and ashes now. We should put some distance between ourselves and this mess, before any githyanki come investigating."
Shadowheart,"That drow, Nere, is going to be on his last gasp unless someone digs him out. Though not necessarily our concern, of course."
Shadowheart,It seems like Wyll and Karlach will play nice from now on. Saves us having to pick sides.
Shadowheart,"We need to make a decision - and you becoming a mind flayer seems like the least-worst option, unfortunately."
Shadowheart,Most would think us mad for wandering right into the middle of a goblin war clan... I suppose that goes to demonstrate just how desperate we are.
Shadowheart,So Gale just consumes magical items like I do wine? We truly are a group apart...
Shadowheart,"Nevertheless, as quirks go, that's a new one for me."
Shadowheart,I just hope he's able to keep his hunger in check.
Shadowheart,Gortash is no more - and he was kind enough to bequeath his Netherstone to us. We might yet manage to pull this off.
Shadowheart,"So Lorroakan covets Dame Aylin? He'll live to regret that, once we inform her."
Shadowheart,I think I've had my fill of underwater misadventures. Let's get back to the surface world before any more perils seek us out.
Shadowheart,I thought this camp was supposed to be our safe haven - not quite so when we wake up to dead tiefling bards. I may have difficulty sleeping for a while...
Shadowheart,We need to keep pressing forward. The day isn't won until Ketheric Thorm has breathed his last.
Shadowheart,"In fact, none of us can. That thing is shielding us, somehow. I don't want to know what happens if we lose it."
Shadowheart,"I'll wager they'll thank you with a blade through the heart. You're tainted in their eyes, same as me. And your best chance is to stay close to the artefact."
Shadowheart,Agreed. There's not much we can do but press forward.
Shadowheart,"I only know what I know... I was ordered to retrieve it, and that's what I intend to do. The rest is immaterial to me."
Shadowheart,A problem for another time. Hopefully we'll no longer be in need of protection by the time my mission draws to an end.
Shadowheart,"Things won't be the same, without Astarion. At least he got to enjoy his moment of triumph... before we betrayed him."
Shadowheart,"You accepted Bhaal, after everything we've been through? I can only hope this is part of some clever scheme I'm not privy to. Otherwise you might as well have stayed with the Absolute."
Shadowheart,"Damn. I was hoping my imagination had gotten the better of me, but this must be something more."
Shadowheart,"It seems like we can't escape this mess, in the waking world or otherwise."
Shadowheart,"Don't play coy. It happened to you as well, didn't it? It's all over your face."
Shadowheart,We shouldn't have allowed the likes of Aradin to get the drop on us. Better be careful in future.
Shadowheart,"It seems like Cazador used Astarion's flesh not as a canvas, but as a contract. We haven't heard the last of this, I'll wager."
Shadowheart,"Baldur's Gate... you know, I never quite believed I'd actually make it back. Wasn't until we got within reach of Wyrm's Crossing that it felt real."
Shadowheart,"I suppose I am. Though the chance to savour the moment might be brief, given all that still lies ahead of us."
Shadowheart,"I may have to rely on your local knowledge, to plug the gaps in my own mind. Hopefully I'll remember more than I expect to."
Shadowheart,"I suppose it is. Though the chance to savour the moment might be brief, given all that still lies ahead of us."
Shadowheart,"Blessings from afar...? Perhaps Mystra is more invested in you than it seems, Gale."
Shadowheart,I had another dream - which I suppose means you did as well.
Shadowheart,Whoever's reaching out to us truly does seem opposed to the Absolute - but wants us to embrace the tadpole? Venture right into the heart of the cult?
Shadowheart,Perhaps we truly have a secret protector - or we're walking into a trap.
Shadowheart,"You'd think I'd have more sympathy for someone trapped in a pod, but perhaps we should have left Mizora where we found her."
Shadowheart,"So Cazador saw fit to carve his ambitions right into your flesh, Astarion. If I was you, I'd return the favour with interest."
Shadowheart,That face-thief Orin's made off with Gale. We'll need to rescue him... unless we actually intend to kill Gortash for her.
Shadowheart,It seems the githyanki are keen to reclaim the artefact I carry. I can't afford that to happen.
Shadowheart,"It seems you have made up with Mystra, Gale. Congratulations - though I don't see any such reconciliation between myself and Shar any time soon..."
Shadowheart,It seems your fellow githyanki are keen to reclaim the artefact I carry. I can't afford that to happen.
Shadowheart,"Feels like we're nearly at the end, one way or the other..."
Shadowheart,"So it's the Blade of Avernus now, Wyll? I suppose that's a new sort of frontier."
Shadowheart,So Wyll's the Blade of Avernus now? I suppose that's a new sort of frontier for him.
Shadowheart,This place is like a glimpse into the future - no need to raise an army when you can just build one.
Shadowheart,"Minthara is in Orin's clutches. Either we try to mount a rescue, or pay for her release with Gortash's life."
Shadowheart,The Shadowfell... this is Lady Shar's power in its purest form. Nothing can resist her will here.
Shadowheart,"So that's how you win Mystra's forgiveness - self-sacrifice? I'm sorry, Gale. That can't be what you wanted to hear."
Shadowheart,"This is it... where I was raised, trained... hells, it's strange to be back."
Shadowheart,Our new friend with the myriad limbs seems to know this route well. I just hope we can keep the ruse up once we reach our destination...
Shadowheart,"It doesn't seem so long ago that Minthara would have sought to kill us, and now we've welcomed her along. We're nothing if not magnanimous."
Shadowheart,It seems Gale has made amends with Mystra. Good for him - though I don't see any such reconciliation between myself and Shar any time soon...
Shadowheart,It seems Gale has made amends with Mystra. Good for him - though his choice of goddesses leaves something to be desired...
Shadowheart,"Moonrise Towers... if this is indeed the very centre of the Absolute's schemes, then the source of our problem must be in here somewhere."
Shadowheart,"I didn't think I'd live to see the day when you turned your back on your queen, but all things considered... good for you."
Shadowheart,"I didn't think I'd live to see the day when Lae'zel turned her back on Vlaakith, but all things considered... good for her."
Shadowheart,'The Blade of Frontiers'. Let's hope Wyll lives up to his name - we'll need all the help we can get.
Shadowheart,"So, no deal with Raphael. I wouldn't want to give him the satisfaction, anyway."
Shadowheart,"I'm sorry, Gale. You tried. Mystra was wrong to turn on you, no matter what mistakes you made in the past."
Shadowheart,"Mystra was never worthy of your devotion, Gale. She will rue the day she turned on you, I am sure."
Shadowheart,Jaheira's adept at keeping secrets - and for good reason. She was wise to try and keep her family safe... I just wish I could've done the same.
Shadowheart,Jaheira's adept at keeping secrets - to conceal a family is no mean feat. Perhaps her skills lean more towards the Dark Lady than she realises...
Shadowheart,"We may need to increase our camp provisions now that we have Karlach along for the journey - those muscles don't run on fresh air, I'll wager. Still, she'll be useful in a fight."
Shadowheart,"Grand Duke-to-be, eh, Wyll? I hope you don't forget about us little people, after you've ascended."
Shadowheart,"Seems like Wyll's a Grand Duke-to-be. I hope he remembers us little people, after he's ascended."
Shadowheart,I'll miss Astarion... though perhaps my neck won't.
Shadowheart,Whatever Lady Shar bids me to. I must not fail her now - not when I'm so close...
Shadowheart,"It seems you have made up with Mystra, Gale. Congratulations. Lady Shar has no love for your goddess... but I am glad you have someone to turn to."
Shadowheart,"Orin's little display was just intended to rattle us. We mustn't let her succeed... but need to stay alert, all the same."
Shadowheart,"That crèche would be a smoking ruin if it wasn't for us. Still, better move along - I don't want to test the limits of githyanki gratitude."
Shadowheart,"So, the Stone Lord is Minsc, Jaheira's old acquaintance? Painfully small world, at times."
Shadowheart,It feels like my entire world has been upended.
Shadowheart,"You had best hope Vlaakith appreciates your loyalty, Lae'zel. Otherwise I think you just killed a potential ally."
Shadowheart,"Lae'zel had better hope Vlaakith appreciates her loyalty. Otherwise, she achieved nothing but kill a potential ally."
Shadowheart,We should be safe for the night now. Let's try and get some rest.
Shadowheart,I can't believe Mystra actually expects Gale to just sacrifice himself like that. Seems like a waste of a fine mind.
Shadowheart,"I didn't expect you to turn on the Lich Queen so readily, Lae'zel. Wonders never cease."
Shadowheart,I didn't expect Lae'zel to turn on the Lich Queen so readily. Wonders never cease.
Shadowheart,We've had a mind flayer whispering to us in our dreams all this time...? I really shouldn't be surprised by anything at this stage.
Shadowheart,"Still... it seems keen to be an ally, in its own way. Compared to what we're up against, I'm not sure that's a bad thing."
Shadowheart,"So you remain loyal to your queen? You're consistent, I'll give you that..."
Shadowheart,"So Lae'zel remains loyal to her queen? She's consistent, I'll give her that..."
Shadowheart,Karlach and Wyll seem to have put their differences aside. I thought it was going to come to blows for a moment.
Shadowheart,This place seems remarkably tense for a sacred grove. Perhaps we shouldn't linger.
Shadowheart,"But let's at least see if there's a healer to be found, first of all."
Shadowheart,"It was no easy thing, overcoming those urges that gripped you. I'm not sure I would have managed, in your shoes. Well done."
Shadowheart,There's nothing like a stroll through some sewers to keep your sense of self-importance in check.
Shadowheart,"Your father won't be around forever, Wyll. But the pact? That's a different matter. I hope you won't live to regret being sentimental."
Shadowheart,"It can't have been easy, to resign yourself to keeping the pact. But I'm glad you choose your father."
Shadowheart,"Wyll's father won't be around forever, but the pact? That's a different matter. I hope he won't live to regret being sentimental."
Shadowheart,"It can't have been easy, for Wyll to resign himself to the pact. But I'm glad he chose his father."
Shadowheart,"If this place is as inviting as other aspects of githyanki culture, we'll be in for an interesting time, to say the least..."
Shadowheart,"That crèche would be a smoking ruin if it wasn't for us. Still, better move along - I don't want to test the limits of your peoples' gratitude."
Shadowheart,I suppose Astarion is a part of the vampire aristocracy now. I hope he doesn't expect us to bow to him.
Shadowheart,"So, Jaheira is willing to embrace mortality - the ultimate form of retirement - and that's thanks to impressing her through your actions. Quite the compliment."
Shadowheart,"This place is quite a find. Imagine all the people going about their lives, unaware of what their city has hidden away."
Shadowheart,We can't rely on the Harpers - not when Orin has them infested with shapeshifters. We're on our own - though I suppose we're used to it by now.
Shadowheart,Wyrm's Crossing. We could be inside the city walls before long... and I could be back where this all started.
Shadowheart,"Be careful, consuming shadow magic. The darkness tends to take more than it gives. I would know."
Shadowheart,"You couldn't resist the allure of the shadows, Gale? I don't blame you - it's the only power that truly counts."
Shadowheart,Orin's made off with Yenna. Either we mount a rescue... or we win her freedom with Gortash's life.
Shadowheart,I think we've overstayed our welcome in this place - if we ever truly had one to begin with. We should leave.
Shadowheart,"Those vampire spawn came for you, didn't they Astarion? Good thing you're charming enough to fight for."
Shadowheart,"Those vampire spawn came for Astarion, didn't they? Lucky for him that we were here to fight them off..."
Shadowheart,"The House of Hope - Raphael's abode. Only this time, he hasn't invited us to his table..."
Shadowheart,"So, one dead devil, and you might learn something new about yourself, Astarion. Seems promising... if you trust Raphael, that is."
Shadowheart,It seems Viconia sought a greater purpose than Lady Shar had decided for her.
Shadowheart,"Shar did not come to Viconia's defence. All who bow to her are disposable pawns, in the end."
Shadowheart,"Ironic. She tried to cling to Lady Shar's good graces, but that just hastened her downfall. "
Shadowheart,"She should have just obeyed - forgotten about the artefact. Then perhaps she could have still served the Nightsinger... under me, of course."
Shadowheart,The mission she sent me on was a lie - same as everything else she ever told me.
Shadowheart,"She sowed her own downfall in trying to take the prism for herself. Had she never sent me, I'd still bow to Shar, none the wiser..."
Shadowheart,Why the hells did she want the prism? It cost her everything.
Shadowheart,No matter. Her loss is my gain. Lady Shar wills it.
Shadowheart,No matter. I hope I never have to think of her again.
Shadowheart,"A goddess abandoning you needn't be the end, Gale. Trust me, I know."
Shadowheart,"I'm sorry, Gale. To be abandoned by your goddess... I cannot imagine how that must feel. May the Dark Lady comfort you."
Shadowheart,Poor Gale. I hope he knows that a goddess abandoning him needn't be the end - I know from experience.
Shadowheart,Poor Gale. To be abandoned by his goddess... I cannot imagine how that must feel. May the Dark Lady comfort him.
Shadowheart,"I suppose not many can boast that they've been to a githyanki crèche and survived. Perhaps that's a good omen for our chances going forward, if you're feeling optimistic."
Shadowheart,Let me see to those wounds.
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, I'll make it better."
Shadowheart,I'll fix you up.
Shadowheart,I've dreamed of this place. This is my destiny - I must complete the trials.
Shadowheart,"We can discuss your hurt feelings later. If we want to make progress in this place, we have to do the trials."
Shadowheart,You don't understand - this will help free us from our infection.
Shadowheart,You know me better than most - but I need to find out if I'm worthy.
Shadowheart,Yes. I've had some doubts in the past... but surely that's normal for such a monumentous step.
Shadowheart,Do you really need to ask? It's all I've ever wanted.
Shadowheart,"What does it mean? It means we'll have power - power we can use to take on the Absolute and rid ourselves of these parasites, once and for all."
Shadowheart,"If I become a Dark Justiciar, I'll have Lady Shar's highest blessing, and her arsenal at my disposal. This will be good for all of us. Let's explore."
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, I won't sacrifice you. I think Lady Shar would want a more impressive offering."
Shadowheart,"If I prove myself to Lady Shar, she'll bless me with power - power we can use to take on the Absolute and rid ourselves of these parasites, once and for all. Let's explore.<br>"
Shadowheart,"In order to join Lady Shar's elite, you had to pass her trials, then make a sacrifice in her innermost sanctum - one revealed only when you've proven yourself. Very few made it that far."
Shadowheart,"I'm glad we can face them together. If we become Dark Justiciars, we'll have Lady Shar's highest blessing, and her arsenal at our disposal. Let's explore.<br>"
Shadowheart,Frankly I'm amazed you didn't work it out for yourself already. I'm not sure if that makes you highly respectful or deeply ignorant.
Shadowheart,"If you're going to just stand there and stare, at least let me go ahead with the trial."
Shadowheart,"Another trial. I need to do this, same as before."
Shadowheart,This is one of Lady Shar's trials. Allow me - please.
Shadowheart,I thought we had a shared understanding - and a shared respect. Perhaps not.
Shadowheart,Try it for yourself then - perhaps I'll learn from your death.
Shadowheart,Through there... there's something about it. Need to look.
Shadowheart,There's something strange about the vermin in this place. Can't put my finger on what though.
Shadowheart,"Oddly brazen, for a rat. We should just move along."
Shadowheart,"Unwelcoming vermin aside, we need to explore this place."
Shadowheart,"Thank you. If I become a Dark Justiciar, I'll have Lady Shar's highest blessing, and her arsenal at my disposal. This will be good for all of us. Let's explore.<br>"
Shadowheart,I'm sorry I kept it from you. It's not a secret to be shared lightly.
Shadowheart,"Not the place or manner in which I thought you'd learn it, but yes - I worship the Dark Lady."
Shadowheart,There's nothing more for us to do here - not until we complete Lady Shar's trials.
Shadowheart,Those shadows; there's power coursing through them... oddly familiar. Better stay on alert.
Shadowheart,"Sounds like the mastiffs are still here, beyond the light."
Shadowheart,He's scarpered. We'd better track him down - if the shadows don't stop us first.
Shadowheart,"Hmm, quite clever - and cruel, of course... but creatively so."
Shadowheart,"Oh, come on now - it happens to the best of us, from time to time."
Shadowheart,The Dark Lady shields me - I can feel her.
Shadowheart,Even Lady Shar's blessings cannot protect me here.
Shadowheart,The curse bites deep here... I need to get to safety.
Shadowheart,I can feel the shadows' power here... but they don't seem to be harming me?
Shadowheart,Dark Justiciars fell here. Those signs we saw before were no coincidence - they led us here.
Shadowheart,"A Dark Justiciar fell here, I'm certain of it..."
Shadowheart,More signs of Dark Justiciars. They must have had a stronghold nearby.
Shadowheart,More Dark Justiciar relics. This is no coincidence.
Shadowheart,"More signs of Dark Justiciars. Lady Shar is guiding us to something, but what...? Got to keep looking."
Shadowheart,Signs of fallen Dark Justiciars. This can't be a coincidence - they must have originated from somewhere nearby.
Shadowheart,A place of offering to the Dark Lady. May she embrace the entire world.
Shadowheart,Such a noble shrine. I fail to understand why some speak ill of Shar. She radiates grace.
Shadowheart,Even the rats have the good sense to pay homage to Lady Shar.
Shadowheart,A potion that makes you explode? Seems a bit drastic.
Shadowheart,The Dark Lady's path lies in darkness. Perhaps that is how I can proceed.
Shadowheart,"I hear you, Lady Shar. I shall not fail."
Shadowheart,We have all the gems - let's put them to use and continue onwards.
Shadowheart,We should be able to proceed now - the trials are all complete. Lady Shar's final task is near.
Shadowheart,"I'm not imagining it, am I? These rats seem to be getting more articulate."
Shadowheart,There has to be more to this place. There has to be a reason I came to be here.
Shadowheart,Florrick's done for unless someone helps her soon.
Shadowheart,Curious. Part of me thought there'd be more to this place...
Shadowheart,Lady Shar's will shall be done. As sure as night will fall.
Shadowheart,Cloak me in your shadow. Guide me to your victory.
Shadowheart,I have emptied my hearts of falsehoods.
Shadowheart,This must be where initiates undertook their final preparations. The end is near.
Shadowheart,"Almost there. I will not fail you, my lady."
Shadowheart,"If you're going to hesitate, just stand aside and let me do the trial myself."
Shadowheart,Another trial. I should do this one as well.
Shadowheart,This is one of Lady Shar's trials. Allow me - it's important.
Shadowheart,"These trials mean something to me, don't you understand? I thought I could rely on you."
Shadowheart,Try not to hit an artery.
Shadowheart,All three stones. These should allow us to dominate that brain.
Shadowheart,This is no time to indulge your pettiness. These trials are important to me.
Shadowheart,So he's responsible for the carnage down here. All those Dark Justiciars... slaughtered.
Shadowheart,That silver tongue of yours is dangerous - bravo. I can't believe you actually pulled that off...
Shadowheart,Careful -  I'm not sure we want Raphael as an enemy. 
Shadowheart,"We're wasting time. Please, just let me do this."
Shadowheart,Another trial. Allow me - please.
Shadowheart,Seems your determined to put our mutual trust to the test. Pity.
Shadowheart,"I'll remember that, should you ever need something of me."
Shadowheart,My lady... forgive me...
Shadowheart,"Please, my lady... forgive me..."
Shadowheart,Why are you looking at that dead spider... coquettishly?<br>
Shadowheart,"Honestly, what did you think was going to happen? You'd develop a taste for it?"
Shadowheart,I have vanquished your foes.
Shadowheart,Sounds like just what we need to get to Moonrise. 
Shadowheart,Nearly there... have to keep going...
Shadowheart,Hells. Talk about wiping the smirk off his face...
Shadowheart,"There's more to this place, I'm sure of it. Lady Shar's presence is near..."
Shadowheart,"I'd trust this gasbag about as far as I can throw him - which isn't far. But perhaps better to play along, for now."
Shadowheart,Lady Shar... I can feel her all around. This is her domain. This is the Shadowfell.
Shadowheart,What have you done?! Her fate was mine to decide!
Shadowheart,"You may have his trust, but you've lost mine. Farewell."
Shadowheart,"Then this is where we part ways. Shar forgive me, I was so close... Farewell."
Shadowheart,What you thought was best...? This was important to me - this was everything to me. 
Shadowheart,There's nothing more to be said. Farewell.
Shadowheart,Perhaps it wouldn't have come to that. But we'll never know now - you took the decision away from me. 
Shadowheart,Ready for what?
Shadowheart,Dark Lady be merciful... What have I done?
Shadowheart,To get out of this place? Absolutely.
Shadowheart,For my weapon? Naturally.
Shadowheart,What have you done? She was to be Shar's sacrifice - her death was to be my destiny!
Shadowheart,We need to leave. Lady Shar won't stand for us to be here - not after what we did.
Shadowheart,"That's what frightens me. She must be angry, yet I don't feel it, or hear it... There's only silence."
Shadowheart,"Let's get out of here, please. Whatever's coming, I don't want to be in the heart of the Shadowfell when it finds me."
Shadowheart,"The Nightsong will be headed for Moonrise Towers. We'd better get there, and see what she's unleashed against Ketheric Thorm."
Shadowheart,I'm not sure there's a place that's far enough away for me to go. Lady Shar must be angry... but there's only silence.
Shadowheart,"Used by initiates for the final step to becoming Dark Justiciar... not all were worthy of the Spear of Night, it seems."
Shadowheart,A ceremonial spear... but not the true Spear of Night. Lady Shar's hand never held this.
Shadowheart,"Just a little bit farther. See my actions, Lady Shar. Hear my words of faith."
Shadowheart,We need to put a stop to this - now!
Shadowheart,"Blessed Nightsinger, witness my adoration..."
Shadowheart,Sounds like a Moonlantern - that's just what we need.
Shadowheart,You're free... The Absolute must be keen to meet us.
Shadowheart,"Careful, in future - you can't just stick your hand in every strange hole you come across."
Shadowheart,More Selûnite markings. No worshippers left though.
Shadowheart,"A kind touch. The dead may not care, but thank you all the same."
Shadowheart,"My favourite. A kind touch, thank you."
Shadowheart,My favourite flower. Just a small remembrance... from one who can scarcely remember. Rest well.
Shadowheart,A small remembrance... from one who can scarcely remember. Rest well.
Shadowheart,Odd... I can't help but feel a twinge of sorrow at this grave. But why? Who is this?
Shadowheart,"Odd... I feel a touch of loss at this grave. Grief, even. But who is this?"
Shadowheart,"This man served Lady Shar in secret, and taught me his skills. He is in her embrace now."
Shadowheart,That graffiti... it almost looks like it was done in my hand. Did I do this? 
Shadowheart,The follies of youth. I have no need to daub walls in other to be remembered now.
Shadowheart,"Her patronage couldn't spare this place from goblins, clearly. Heh."
Shadowheart,Vile statues everywhere. How could a temple of Shar be here also?
Shadowheart,Some deluded fool actually took time to carve this.<br>
Shadowheart,No Selûnites left to bow before this.<br>
Shadowheart,"All of these idols should be torn down. Another time, perhaps.<br>"
Shadowheart,A statue of Selûne. This ruin must have been dedicated to her.<br>
Shadowheart,So many Selûne statues. But no worshippers.<br>
Shadowheart,All these blasted statues. At least the worshippers are long dead or gone.<br>
Shadowheart,"Sounds like random butchery. If I kill, it has to be with purpose."
Shadowheart,Selûnites wouldn't have abandoned this place willingly. What happened?<br>
Shadowheart,"More Selûne dedications. What happened, I wonder?<br>"
Shadowheart,Selûne statues everywhere. How could a temple of Shar be here also?
Shadowheart,A disgusting waste of stonecraft.<br>
Shadowheart,Now left to ruin and goblins. Good.
Shadowheart,"And now it's a nest for some filthy goblins. A fitting end, heh."
Shadowheart,Selûne markings. She was once worshipped here.
Shadowheart,"Leftover rats, cornered in their hole. They can still cause trouble for us though."
Shadowheart,"My final task lies ahead, in the Chamber of Loss."
Shadowheart,I have to find my parents. They must be close.
Shadowheart,"I think this was my favourite part - losing myself in here. Being someone else, even just for a while."
Shadowheart,"All these disguises... we were taught that Lady Shar's warriors had to be able to hide in plain sight, wherever we went..."
Shadowheart,"I think this was my favourite part - putting these on, pretending to be someone else. I suppose that's been my whole life."
Shadowheart,A cunning disguise can serve a warrior of the Dark Lady better than any armour. That's what they always told us.
Shadowheart,I don't think I ever wore this one. Shame - the colour might have suited me.
Shadowheart,The Mother Superior even gave me elocution lessons. Helped me blend in.
Shadowheart,What was the mission? Blackmail? A honey trap...? I can't even remember. Not sure I want to.
Shadowheart,"This fabric... I think I attended a ball, once. Infiltrated it, rather."
Shadowheart,"This disguise... I remember it. We all had to wear it, for training. Horrible, itchy thing."
Shadowheart,This tunic... I'm sure I wore it. Did I have to disguise myself as a bard?
Shadowheart,"A Dark Justiciar helm. I wanted one of my own so badly... hard to imagine, now."
Shadowheart,A Dark Justiciar helm. I wanted one of my own so badly... and the Mother Superior would always deny me.
Shadowheart,"What have you done?! As soon as I get back to camp, you and I are finished."
Shadowheart,"Agh... Lady Shar's mark. I felt it burn, then it just... stopped. Why? Something's wrong."
Shadowheart,"Agh... my wound. It burned with pain, then... nothing? Why? Something's wrong."
Shadowheart,They were mine to deal with - not yours!
Shadowheart,Monster - they were my parents!
Shadowheart,"Mother Superior seemed to travel a lot, before this place. She seemed to remember that time fondly..."
Shadowheart,Stop - they're mine to deal with. Touch them and you die.
Shadowheart,Touch them again and it'll be the last thing you do!
Shadowheart,"This feels familiar to me, somehow. I'm sure I've stood before this mirror before... many times, perhaps."
Shadowheart,More heretical symbols. Of course.
Shadowheart,Why do Lady Shar's dead attack? Am I being tested...?
Shadowheart,More vile idolatry. Makes my stomach turn.
Shadowheart,"For once, the goblins' decorations are an improvement."
Shadowheart,Poor fool. He resisted the Shadowfell - and suffered all the more for it.
Shadowheart,Thaniel? We've heard that name before - from Halsin. That's who he's looking for.
Shadowheart,"That tadpoled Fist thinks we're his allies. No need to correct him just yet, if he can help us."
Shadowheart,"A Selûnite shrine, hidden away."
Shadowheart,Perhaps it's time we paid Raphael a visit.
Shadowheart,"A shrine to Selûne. I might have sneered at this, once. Or tried to destroy it."
Shadowheart,Selûnite magic. Dark Lady forgive me.
Shadowheart,A gaudy display. Let's just hope it actually protects us.
Shadowheart,A Sharran? Perhaps someone I should seek out...
Shadowheart,"And rightly so. The last thing we need is someone of your potential becoming enthralled with Shar's magic, Gale."
Shadowheart,"Forget what Mystra wants - think about yourself, and what Lady Shar's power could do for you, Gale. Make the Lantern - spread her will."
Shadowheart,There is nothing Sharran about this man. He has betrayed the Dark Lady.
Shadowheart,Let's hope this Z'rell likes what we have to say.
Shadowheart,Look at them all... enough to infect an entire army.
Shadowheart,"These tadpoles came from beneath the tower. If we use them, we'll deny the cultists of their power.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Barely alive by most standards, and still it bows to the Absolute."
Shadowheart,Let's go see Z'rell - and mind you don't slip in the goblin guts.
Shadowheart,Your merciful streak will be the death of us one day. Let's hope Z'rell won't be too angry.
Shadowheart,"First they take her friend, then they steal her face. Some people just don't understand boundaries..."
Shadowheart,Minsc? The very man Jaheira is after.
Shadowheart,Wait - we don't exactly have the advantage here.
Shadowheart,Eternal imprisonment. Would have been kinder to just kill them.
Shadowheart,"I didn't realise you had such a soft streak. Now it'll cost you. And the city as well, perhaps..."
Shadowheart,"Poor fool. He resisted the Dark Lady's embrace, and suffered for it. He should have just accepted her."
Shadowheart,The elder brain's working her like a damn string puppet. What else is it capable of...?
Shadowheart,"His mind lingers in the Shadowfell, but perhaps it can be returned. We need to remind him who he is - some personal effects, maybe."
Shadowheart,Good. Whatever you think you know about me had better be worth it. You've already cost me dearly.
Shadowheart,This ruin's dedicated to Selûne. What happened here...?
Shadowheart,Selûne symbols everywhere... surely there can't be a temple of Shar here.
Shadowheart,Heretic idolatry everywhere... surely there can't be a temple of Shar here.
Shadowheart,This ruin's dedicated to Selûne. Vile moon witch...
Shadowheart,The elder brain was working her like a damn string puppet. What else is it capable of...?
Shadowheart,More Selûne idolatry. No sign of her followers though.
Shadowheart,This one's all yours.
Shadowheart,It's quite beautiful - though dangerous things often are.
Shadowheart,Fool - that artefact is the only thing keeping us safe. She cannot have it.
Shadowheart,"Good. Whatever happens to us, the lich queen must not take the artefact."
Shadowheart,What are you doing?!
Shadowheart,"That's it. We're dead, thanks to you."
Shadowheart,"Hells, was that really necessary? You almost got hatchling on me."
Shadowheart,Not one to heed warning then? This could end very badly.<br>
Shadowheart,We should leave that thing and just get out of here while we can.<br>
Shadowheart,Not one to heed warnings then? We should leave that thing - it seems like trouble.
Shadowheart,I think this crèche's days are numbered - let's get out of here.
Shadowheart,The original occupants might object - unless the gith just slaughtered them?
Shadowheart,I sincerely hope you know what you're doing...
Shadowheart,I don't like the look of this thing. Its 'cure' could be a metal bolt punched through your skull.
Shadowheart,There's got to be a way to stop this thing!
Shadowheart,This 'cure' looks set to kill you - get out!
Shadowheart,I'll be ready. Whatever you have to say had better be worth your life.
Shadowheart,"He's been in the Shadowfell. All memories will have been stripped away. We need to remind him who he is - some personal effects, maybe."
Shadowheart,"I remember this place now. A whole stolen childhood, spent in these halls."
Shadowheart,"Countless initiates walked these halls once, seeking to become Dark Justiciars."
Shadowheart,That's the last one. The inner sanctum is within reach now.
Shadowheart,"I don't know - it's hardly practical, but when has that ever stopped someone from trying to please their god of choice? I would know."
Shadowheart,"It would be too much of a risk, though. One mishap, one busybody, and you could be surrounded by a mob."
Shadowheart,"After what this city's been through, people will scarcely tolerate cuttlefish at the fishmonger's stall - never mind a full-blown mind flayer in their midst."
Shadowheart,Do you know what this means?
Shadowheart,"All those people you saved... most of them will never know what you did. But you know, and so do I. I'll never forget."
Shadowheart,"I need to get you out of here. It was difficult enough smuggling you in here, covered in cloaks. It'll only get worse as normalcy returns."
Shadowheart,"I think so, yes. At least for now."
Shadowheart,I can't. Lady Shar needs me. Her children need someone to lead them - my place is with them.
Shadowheart,I... I suppose I should encourage independence amongst the Dark Lady's flock - Viconia held us in too tight a grip. I don't want to make that same mistake.
Shadowheart,Very well. There are many ways to serve Lady Shar - the cloister can wait. And who is to say what useful secrets I might stumble upon with a travelling companion such as yourself?
Shadowheart,"Perhaps you could wear a mask - say you're a leper, or have taken religious vows to conceal your face."
Shadowheart,"Besides, I think I'm due a sabbatical."
Shadowheart,"May Lady Shar's darkness cloak you and shield you. You will find few friends in the light of day, but you can still count on me."
Shadowheart,"That would call for an awful lot of discretion, you know. Enough to make even a former Sharran take pause..."
Shadowheart,"...but after all we've been through, I really should know better than to doubt you, shouldn't I?"
Shadowheart,"All right - let's try. We've gotten this far, after all. Just... let me do the explaining, to my parents. They've been through a lot - I'd rather they didn't die of shock."
Shadowheart,"All right - let's try. We've gotten this far, after all. Just... let me do the talking. You'd be amazed what a pretty face can get away with."
Shadowheart,"You need to take care of yourself, keep out of danger. Perhaps... perhaps there is some way, some unfathomable way we can still see each other, eventually."
Shadowheart,"Such a thing must exist, surely... so I refuse to call this farewell. Just 'until next time'."
Shadowheart,I can't. My parents... I need to be with them now. I'm sorry.
Shadowheart,"I can't... at least not right now. I'm sorry. After everything that happened with my parents, with Shar, I need time to myself. Time to find myself."
Shadowheart,"I can't, I'm sorry. We may have saved the world, but I have unfinished business to take care of. I don't want to jeopardise you while I look for my place in this world."
Shadowheart,"If you wish, perhaps you can still come to see me, now and again. I have a hidden place, close to the cloister, where night orchids bloom. If you ever wish to see me, go there."
Shadowheart,It sounds like the city's trying to get back on its feet already. Normal life is returning... which means things are about to become decidedly more difficult for you.
Shadowheart,Last night was... an experience. But I don't think you've changed quite as much as some might think. I'd recognise that vigour anywhere.
Shadowheart,That's one thing I'm good at. Or so I understand.
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar's work is never-ending. I've cleansed the ranks of her followers, leaving only the faithful - the worthy."
Shadowheart,"Now is the time to spread her word: so many have suffered greatly in recent times, gripped by pain and loss... They will rush to the Dark Lady's embrace."
Shadowheart,"Not everyone would share that view, but you were always different, weren't you?"
Shadowheart,"In another life, this may not have been a parting. It may have been the start of something..."
Shadowheart,"...but we made our choices, and must live with what we have - and what we've lost."
Shadowheart,"Still though, you know where the House of Grief is, and what lies beneath it. We all need to be unburdened, every now and again."
Shadowheart,"It was special, but also fleeting... as it was always going to be."
Shadowheart,"Do you know why I love night orchids? In part, because they do not last. They bloom where few ever see them, and in that moment they're perfect. Then they return to the darkness that birthed them."
Shadowheart,"I am glad for the time we had together. There is much I still cannot truly remember, but I will never forget you."
Shadowheart,"A flame cannot burn without fuel, and Lady Shar's church would not thrive if everyone was happy and content. We are nothing but a dark mirror, held up to show society's failings."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps you'll come to realise that, in time. If you do, you know where the House of Grief is, and what lies beneath it. We all need to be unburdened, every now and again."
Shadowheart,"Of course things could have been different, but nothing says they would have been better. I fulfilled my destiny, just as Lady Shar wished me to."
Shadowheart,That's not to say there aren't parts I wished were different... but I suppose that's how you know when you've done something of value - when you know what you sacrificed to achieve it.
Shadowheart,I understand. You can't stave off oblivion forever. At least not here.
Shadowheart,"Could you not return to the Hells? Wait this out, find a cure...?"
Shadowheart,"I... I think the voice inside you will guide you to where you need to be. Mine called me to Lady Shar. And yours...? Well, only you can know for sure."
Shadowheart,"I can't, I'm sorry. My place is here. Lady Shar needs me. Her children need me."
Shadowheart,I can respect that. The same end awaits us all. At least you can ensure the final moments are on your own terms.
Shadowheart,"Come. Let's get you some fresh air. I'll stay with you, right until the end."
Shadowheart,"You look off-colour. It's your engine, isn't it? Oblivion beckons at last."
Shadowheart,"The only reason for that would be if I had died in battle. Did I seem dead to you, last night?"
Shadowheart,Thought as much.
Shadowheart,"You are adorable, though perhaps a little inattentive."
Shadowheart,"We have. And our luck held, despite everything. But we can't rely on that forever. I won't roll the dice, day after day, if your life is on the line."
Shadowheart,"By rights, yes. Unfortunately, though, people's fears and hatreds are not so logical. They'd cheer as they burned their saviour on a pyre. I won't stand by and let that happen."
Shadowheart,"You deserve to be vaunted, adored. Statues in your image should stand on every square. A whole generation of babies should be named in your honour... but it will not be so."
Shadowheart,"For a time, perhaps. Deception and concealment has been part of my life for so long... but this is different. This is beyond me."
Shadowheart,Last night was perfect. Saving the world is quite the aphrodisiac.
Shadowheart,Well... we may have put a stop to the Absolute and rid ourselves of the tadpoles... but too many of my own concerns went untended as a result.
Shadowheart,"Now I must try to rectify that, see to my own affairs. Little point in saving the world only to have no clear place in it afterwards."
Shadowheart,This is something I have to do for myself. What we shared was special to me... but I think our paths diverge from here on.
Shadowheart,But who knows? Perhaps we'll meet again. Though hopefully not after being abducted. Be good. And if you can't be good... just don't get caught.
Shadowheart,In truth? Conflicted. We may have put a stop to the Absolute and rid ourselves of the tadpoles... but too many of my own concerns went untended as a result. 
Shadowheart,Last night was perfect. Almost perfect.
Shadowheart,"After everything that happened - with my parents, with Shar - I didn't think I was owed any happiness. I did things. Things that fill me with shame now."
Shadowheart,"There's at least one person who doesn't want me happy - Shar. I felt the wound last night, while you were meditating. Like some sadistic child, de-winging a fly. "
Shadowheart,"There's at least one person who doesn't want me happy - Shar. I felt the wound last night, while you were sleeping. Like some sadistic child, de-winging a fly. "
Shadowheart,Thank you. Sometimes I have to remind myself of that very thing - it's nice to hear someone else say it.
Shadowheart,You and I... our time together has been very dear to me. I had hoped maybe there might be more to come.
Shadowheart,"Let her rage on. She may be able to hurt me, but she can't control me - not anymore."
Shadowheart,You're right. I can always rely on you to say the right thing.
Shadowheart,"It's not an exciting life that I lead, but I'd like you to be a part of it. I doubt I'd have anything at all if it wasn't for you."
Shadowheart,"Good. Then seek me out, when you have time. I'm hoping to find some place I can settle down and stay close to my parents. Somewhere quiet, where they can find peace, and gaze at the night sky..."
Shadowheart,I'll keep a spot for you. It'll be just like old times.
Shadowheart,"I'm hoping to find some place I can settle down and stay close to my parents. Somewhere quiet, where they can find peace, and gaze at the night sky..."
Shadowheart,"If that sounds at all appealing, then I'll keep a spot for you. It'll be just like old times."
Shadowheart,"I'm adept at dealing with old wounds, trust me. But if you don't want to... well, I won't force you."
Shadowheart,"But I'll keep myself easy to find, in case you change your mind. You may come to miss me yet."
Shadowheart,"I could come with you, once I've taken care of my parents. They'll understand; they've always had each other. They'd want us to be happy."
Shadowheart,The worst place to end up is anywhere that doesn't let you be at my side.
Shadowheart,But I made it in the end.
Shadowheart,"All this has been to bring me to this point, and now I'm finally here - thanks in no small part to you."
Shadowheart,She can try to twist the knife all she likes - I know I can survive her worst. Nothing she does can sour the fact that I have my family again.
Shadowheart,Then I realised I was in your arms. We did it. Everything's perfect.
Shadowheart,"No... and I wouldn't ask you to, in truth. You're living proof of the sacrifice you made... but I fear others may not see it that way."
Shadowheart,Last night was perfect.
Shadowheart,"Though... I couldn't help lying there, thinking about my parents, before you stirred."
Shadowheart,"I gave them the release they asked for, freed myself from Shar's grasp, just as they wished for... but there's moments where I think I'd trade that to be able to see them again, talk to them again."
Shadowheart,"There's so much only they could have told me. But that's all gone now - I've got to move on, find some place for myself."
Shadowheart,"I think so, yes. It's just up to me to recognise it when it's in front of me..."
Shadowheart,"I don't know exactly what lies ahead for me, but at least now I can choose my own path. With you at my side, if you wish."
Shadowheart,I was hoping you'd say that. Whatever lies ahead will be far less daunting if I have you.
Shadowheart,Perhaps that's wise... I'm still figuring out who I am. Unfair to ask you to commit to an unknown quantity.
Shadowheart,"But after I've found some inner peace, who knows? I'll keep myself easy to find, if you wish to track me down."
Shadowheart,"I see... Well, if you change your mind, I'll keep myself easy to find."
Shadowheart,"No... we've only just put everything behind us, won the chance to be together... It can't end like this. I won't let it."
Shadowheart,"Karlach? You look poorly... It's the engine, isn't it? It's burning out."
Shadowheart,"You need to return to Avernus. Look for a cure, fight on - whatever it takes. Just don't give up."
Shadowheart,Plus Raphael will have Zariel distracted. You can be free of her.
Shadowheart,"I want to be by your side. If that means joining you in the Hells, so be it."
Shadowheart,"I'm sure. If there's a cure to be found, we'll track it down. And if not, I'll still have you."
Shadowheart,I... I thought we could have so much more together. But this is your choice.
Shadowheart,I'll never be able to fill the place by my side where you should be standing. And I'll never forget you. Not a single moment.
Shadowheart,"Come, let's go outside. Some fresh air will do you good. And I'll be with you the entire time."
Shadowheart,Sorry. Thought I'd catch you in the afterglow.
Shadowheart,"More than I thought would be possible, considering the short time we had..."
Shadowheart,"I was afraid for the briefest moment when I woke this morning. I didn't know where I was - I thought perhaps it had all been a dream... stopping the Absolute, saving my parents."
Shadowheart,"Almost, anyway."
Shadowheart,"Last night was... an exception. I hope you understand that. The battle's won, our journey is over, and I need to take my place at Lady Shar's side."
Shadowheart,"Karlach... the Lady of Loss takes everything in the end, but I thought we'd have some more time yet. I'm sorry."
Shadowheart,"Karlach... I thought after all we've survived, maybe one last miracle would rear its head... but no. I'm sorry."
Shadowheart,"He sacrificed everything in order to save our lives, Lae'zel. That ought to count for something to you."
Shadowheart,"Farewell, Lae'zel. May the dark lady guide your blade."
Shadowheart,"Farewell, Lae'zel. I'm a better person for having met you."
Shadowheart,He was as noble in spirit as he was in bloodline. We're in his debt.
Shadowheart,Your people are lucky to have such a noble prince. I hope he manages to adjust to his new way of life.
Shadowheart,His people are lucky to have such a noble prince. I hope manages to adjust to his new way of life.
Shadowheart,"Have you lost your senses? All we've been through, and you just give in to ceremorphosis now?!"
Shadowheart,This isn't a decision to make in haste - let's discuss it together beforehand.
Shadowheart,"And there I was, thinking the killing was over."
Shadowheart,"This wouldn't have been possible without you. We'd all be the thralls of that thing, or worse. Instead, we're free.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Well, I'm certainly glad you feel that way - I doubt I could be so forward-thinking, in your place. Thank you.<br>"
Shadowheart,Not just that - you did what no one else was capable of. Thank you.<br>
Shadowheart,"You do...? Well... all the better then, I suppose.<br>"
Shadowheart,I... I suppose it was. Apologies - I've just been waiting a long time to have the inside of my head to myself.
Shadowheart,"Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with being a mind flayer, of course..."
Shadowheart,Ambitious - don't let Mystra hear you say that. 
Shadowheart,I'm no longer one to take the mercy of goddesses for granted... but I hope Mystra smiles upon you.
Shadowheart,"But what about you, Gale? What will you do now...?"
Shadowheart,I think a celebration is in order. It's the least we deserve.
Shadowheart,"The sooner we kill this thing, the better."
Shadowheart,So. What comes next?
Shadowheart,"Farewell, Gale. I hope he still remembers us little people, once he's secured godhood."
Shadowheart,Though he may have to contend with Mystra before that's a foregone conclusion.
Shadowheart,This should do nicely for a camp.
Shadowheart,"As for us, well... the future awaits."
Shadowheart,That thing's not going to hold together much longer.
Shadowheart,Of all the beings to be indebted to... a bloody mind flayer.
Shadowheart,"I shall prove myself worthy, Lady Shar."
Shadowheart,"Ketheric Thorm, shown as loyal warrior of Selûne. Did Lady Shar embrace him, only to lose him...?"
Shadowheart,That statue... the man wears Selûnite armour and seals. A relic from an unholy age.
Shadowheart,"So many Dark Justiciars, fallen in battle... their source must be nearby."
Shadowheart,"All these Dark Justiciars, slain in battle... they must have had a stronghold nearby, or a temple."
Shadowheart,That armour... it looks like that of the Dark Justiciars.
Shadowheart,Arabella's father. I recognise him from the grove - just about.
Shadowheart,Isn't that Arabella? The little girl Kagha nearly killed?
Shadowheart,"I'm not sure I like her chances out here, even if she does have powers."
Shadowheart,"She's going to get herself killed out here, powers or not."
Shadowheart,"She survived the druids' wrath, just to wind up like this. What a waste."
Shadowheart,He looks set to burst - and we'll probably be left hip-deep in his juices.
Shadowheart,I think your witty remarks were too much for him - he's a blubbering wreck.
Shadowheart,A stinging truth - but a truth nonetheless.
Shadowheart,"We're hardly pushovers, but let's not pretend we can take on an entire army.<br>"
Shadowheart,"A Selûne prayer book. Hmm, well she didn't answer any prayers from this place."
Shadowheart,A prayer book won't be much help to us in this place. We should leave it behind.
Shadowheart,A Selûne prayer book. As if I need this weighing me down.
Shadowheart,"A Selûne prayer book? We should leave it, unless we need kindling for our campfire."
Shadowheart,Rambling nonsense. Why someone would be drawn to this is beyond me.
Shadowheart,I'm sure there's better things you could find to read.
Shadowheart,I didn't realise we had time to read childrens' stories.
Shadowheart,"Well... certainly brave of you, I'll say that much."
Shadowheart,A mind flayer? What's going on here?!
Shadowheart,I will follow in their path. I will succeed.
Shadowheart,"Now you're talking. After all that, I think I'll need a drink in each hand, and a third on the table."
Shadowheart,"I can see the cogs moving behind your eyes, Gale. What's on your mind?"
Shadowheart,"The Underdark? I've had my fill of lurking in the shadows, if it's all the same."
Shadowheart,"A celebration, yes. And perhaps a drink, too. <br>"
Shadowheart,It seems that's the end of Astarion's love affair with the sun. That'll be hard on him...<br>
Shadowheart,"It looks like basking in the sun is no longer an option for you, Astarion. You'd better find some shade.<br>"
Shadowheart,A lot of people died so we could get to this moment.
Shadowheart,Let's go find somewhere to offer them a toast.<br>
Shadowheart,"I never thought I'd be sorry to see a mind flayer go, yet here we are. Be safe."
Shadowheart,"I never thought I'd be sorry to see a mind flayer go, yet here we are. Lady Shar be with you."
Shadowheart,"Yes. The city must be rebuilt. Lady Shar's church needs fertile ground in which to flourish... and in the meanwhile, there will be plenty of lost souls drawn to her embrace..."
Shadowheart,Not just the city - imagine the swathe of destruction the Absolute's armies will have caused.
Shadowheart,"My destiny lies in this city, with Lady Shar's church. They look to me now."
Shadowheart,What's the rush? Surely we're due to be feted as heroes in this place. We'll drink for free if any taverns survived.
Shadowheart,"I suppose our band wasn't meant to last forever... fate thrust us together, now it pulls us apart again.<br>"
Shadowheart,What are you doing? Stop!
Shadowheart,"Order it to die! Do it now, before it's too late!"
Shadowheart,Don't listen! It'll try any trick in order to survive!
Shadowheart,Gale? What's the matter?
Shadowheart,"No harm in clinging to optimism a little longer. If events turn against us, at least we'll know you can act. The Absolute isn't winning, one way or another."
Shadowheart,"You'd do that? Sacrifice yourself for us...? If this is truly what you want, then thank you."
Shadowheart,"The Netherstones - perhaps if we use them here, they'll work this time."
Shadowheart,That's... that's the person from my dreams...
Shadowheart,What the hells are those things?!
Shadowheart,"Karlach... I thought after all we've survived, maybe one last miracle would rear its head... but no. I'm sorry.<br>"
Shadowheart,"The Underdark? As much as I appreciate its shadows, I think Lady Shar will have use for me elsewhere..."
Shadowheart,But I think right of choosing should fall to you. What'll it be?
Shadowheart,"A poor reward, considering the sacrifices you made. But I understand. "
Shadowheart,"As long as it's still you in there, and you haven't completely lost your mind.<br>"
Shadowheart,"I can't say I'm not a little thankful. You've been lucid for quite some time now, and from what I understand, you won't stay that way for long. "
Shadowheart,"I was the first Dark Justiciar in a generation, but soon we'll be legion. And today, we fight at your side."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar, deliver us victory!"
Shadowheart,Astarion - you're starting to crisp up! Get out of the sun!
Shadowheart,And my Adepts sworn to the Lady of Darkness
Shadowheart,She's wandered off... Perhaps she just needs some time alone.
Shadowheart,"She said she needed some time to herself, and she'd meet us at camp. I'm not sure she's going to last much longer..."
Shadowheart,What happened to Karlach...?
Shadowheart,"All that wisdom, lost, forever. All so that we could survive. I owe him my life. We all do. "
Shadowheart,But Gale... he's gone.
Shadowheart,I can't feel the tadpole... they must have all died in the explosion - that means I can't turn into a mind flayer!
Shadowheart,"He did it, he actually did it... he blew up the brain."
Shadowheart,I can't feel the tadpole... they must have all died with the brain - that means I can't turn into a mind flayer!
Shadowheart,I can't feel the tadpole... they must have all died with the brain - that means we can't turn into mind flayers!
Shadowheart,We did it. The Netherbrain is dead. 
Shadowheart,Hells. I'm lucky I learned to swim when I did...
Shadowheart,"The githyanki are leaving. It would have been hard to imagine parting ways from them peacefully, once..."
Shadowheart,So. Lae'zel. Will you be joining them? 
Shadowheart,"Is this farewell then? I'm glad we didn't end up killing each other - things would have been much duller, I'm sure."
Shadowheart,Lae'zel - no!
Shadowheart,I suspected you wouldn't be able to part from me. Looks like I was right.
Shadowheart,We raise a glass to Gale. Perhaps the Elfsong still stands? <br>
Shadowheart,We've certainly benefited from your gifts. It stands to reason that others may do so also. 
Shadowheart,"A poor reward, considering the sacrifices you made. But I understand. May Lady Shar bless you."
Shadowheart,"Oh, come here, will you? It's been forever."
Shadowheart,The Mother Superior must be close. Soon this will all be over.
Shadowheart,"Soon it'll be mine. And with Lady Shar's blessing, it will become even greater."
Shadowheart,An ally in need.
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar, give me a sign."

Shadowheart,I must do all I can. 
Shadowheart, Shadowheart PortraitClick Normal <br>NarrativeArch_MidPoint v1 <br>
Shadowheart,You might find it an uphill battle to get the city populace to accept a devil as their Duke...
Shadowheart,Are you sure being Ravengard's son is enough to be accepted as Grand Duke?
Shadowheart,There's nothing to hail here. Just another power grab in a city that's seen too many of them already.
Shadowheart,"The Blade of Frontiers', eh? No need to tamper with the classics, I suppose."
Shadowheart,"So, Grand Duke-to-be, is it? Should I bow? Or do a little curtsey perhaps?"
Shadowheart,I'll help.
Shadowheart,Of course. Sounds better than most noble feasts.
Shadowheart,"There you are! Keeping us all on tenterhooks so you could make a dramatic entrance, is it?<br>"
Shadowheart,"Agh... have you nothing better to do, Shar? What a sad creature you are."
Shadowheart,"Ngh... I will not allow you to ruin tonight for me, Shar."
Shadowheart,"Agh... away, Shar. Back to the shadows with you"
Shadowheart,"Agh... I'm going to enjoy myself, and you can't stop me. Back to the shadows with you."
Shadowheart,"Ngh... looking for attention, Shar? Pathetic."
Shadowheart,"Agh... you don't like me enjoying myself, do you, Shar? What a surprise."
Shadowheart,"Gods, I remember one evening we had to eat fourteen apples, some fish heads, and a stale loaf of bread just to get by..."
Shadowheart,Why were we scrounging in barrels and crates for supplies when he could source these?
Shadowheart,Withers has a keen eye for a nice vintage. 
Shadowheart,You made it. Lady Shar smiles on us.
Shadowheart,"Hold tight, I'll help.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Stay calm, I'll get you up."
Shadowheart,"Bah, useless. Hold on."
Shadowheart,No harm in a little conversation.
Shadowheart,Let's do this.
Shadowheart,Time to deal some punishment.
Shadowheart,Your time has come.
Shadowheart,No mercy.
Shadowheart,Strike hard. Strike fast.
Shadowheart,Feel my mistress' wrath.
Shadowheart,Darkness strike you down!
Shadowheart,Time to meet your maker.
Shadowheart,Let's make this quick.
Shadowheart,Time to fill some graves.
Shadowheart,Focus. Strike true.
Shadowheart,Down with you.
Shadowheart,"Fall, damn you!"
Shadowheart,"Darkness, guide my hand."
Shadowheart,Prepare to die! 
Shadowheart,Darkness take you!
Shadowheart,You're lucky I'm feeling kind.
Shadowheart,Typical. Suppose I'll help.<br>
Shadowheart,"Ugh, better offer help."
Shadowheart,Suppose I'll lend a hand.
Shadowheart,Better go and help that wretch.<br>
Shadowheart,You're lucky I'm feeling kind.<br>
Shadowheart,His actual nose must be a distant memory by now...
Shadowheart,Withers has quite a nose for fine vintages. Well - in a manner of speaking
Shadowheart,But no more.
Shadowheart,"In another life, Shar would probably be trying to hurt me, for daring to enjoy myself."
Shadowheart,"Excellent. If we ever become friends, I'll know what to call you."
Shadowheart,I don't recognise this. Who was worshipped here?
Shadowheart,"Whoever that even is. No intact symbols here, no dedications - nothing."
Shadowheart,Who were those prayers for? Normally the patron god is obvious - not here.
Shadowheart,Trying to frighten me with cheap tricks? Darkness is my element.
Shadowheart,Let them come. The darkness can be to our advantage.
Shadowheart,Remember how keen she was to leave me to die on the nautiloid? We can't trust her.
Shadowheart,We can't trust her - her kin nearly got us killed when they attacked the nautiloid.
Shadowheart,"What, you got it open, just like that...? "
Shadowheart,There! Not so impregnable after all.
Shadowheart,They can't hold forever. Come on!
Shadowheart,"Blessed Mother, smite the obstacles in my path."
Shadowheart,Bloody doors! 
Shadowheart,Why?! Why won't you just open?!
Shadowheart,Won't get that open easily. Maybe there's another entrance.
Shadowheart,I've tried already. Damn thing won't budge.
Shadowheart,Dead goblins over there. Worth checking for supplies maybe.
Shadowheart,Some sort of chapel or sepulchre... but dedicated to whom?
Shadowheart,Get away from that thing!
Shadowheart,Those people... the mind flayer made them its puppets.
Shadowheart,Ngh... no...
Shadowheart,Agh...
Shadowheart,Uhh...
Shadowheart,"Hmph - the famous Blade of Frontiers, in the flesh. Clever, this hero act you've got going."
Shadowheart,I'd better do the talking.
Shadowheart,I truly hope you're wrong about this.
Shadowheart,A doppelganger in our camp? That sounds all too believable.
Shadowheart,All these familiar faces... it's good to see them again.
Shadowheart,"I must savour this, while I can. Eventually, it will all be taken away from me."
Shadowheart,I am glad I could escape my duties for tonight. The Dark Lady's crusade is all-consuming...
Shadowheart,Lucky thing I didn't decide to go to Amn yet - no way I'd have made it back in time then.
Shadowheart,At least I have my parents to take care of the animals - I'd never had made it in time with them in tow...
Shadowheart,I'm glad the roads were kind - would hate to have missed this.
Shadowheart,Lady Shar has blessed us with a fine night. Just a little wickedness shy of being a  Nightfall ritual...
Shadowheart,What's that supposed to mean?
Shadowheart,What was that...?
Shadowheart,Something's amiss. I feel a presence...
Shadowheart,I feel a presence. Not Lady Shar... something else.
Shadowheart,"Not just any Grand Duke - the most influential in the city, if my memory serves me right. And for once, I think it does."
Shadowheart,"Ravengard? Never met him, but quite popular on the street, as far as aristocrats go."
Shadowheart,"If I was a Sharran lookout, this is the sort of place I'd wait around."
Shadowheart,"The city is close now - followers of Lady Shar will watching, no doubt. Waiting for my return."
Shadowheart,We should do what we can to find them - what they know could help us.
Shadowheart,"The city is close now - my former peers will be watching, no doubt. Waiting for my return."
Shadowheart,"Harsh. Not the family type then, I take it?"
Shadowheart,"The true Ravengard is still clinging on, somewhere in that mind. It might not be too late for him."
Shadowheart,Punished? Florrick must be locked up somewhere - assuming she's still alive.
Shadowheart,"Good idea. And let's trust the fox to safeguard the chicken coop, while we're at it."
Shadowheart,"Silence can be an excellent tool, you know. Especially if it spares you an unwinnable fight."
Shadowheart,"Silence can be very powerful, you know. Especially when it saves our lives."
Shadowheart,"Mizora certainly plays for keeps, anyway."
Shadowheart,I'll see what I can learn.
Shadowheart,Let's see what I can glean.
Shadowheart,I ought to speak.
Shadowheart,What have we got here?
Shadowheart,Shar cloaks me.
Shadowheart,Almost too easy.<br>
Shadowheart,All mine.
Shadowheart,Enchanted.
Shadowheart,I'd better not blush.
Shadowheart,Delighted.
Shadowheart,Anything to hear that voice.
Shadowheart,The highlight of my day.
Shadowheart,I don't need much excuse...
Shadowheart,"A pleasure, as always."
Shadowheart,Let's see what we have here.<br>
Shadowheart,Better get to it.
Shadowheart,I'll give it a try.
Shadowheart,Worth a try.<br>
Shadowheart,"Hmm, let's see."
Shadowheart,Better take a look.
Shadowheart,Worth a look.<br>
Shadowheart,"Allow me, friend."
Shadowheart,"Let me help, friend."
Shadowheart,Let me help you.<br>
Shadowheart,"Come on, up.<br>"
Shadowheart,No time for a lie-down.
Shadowheart,Got to help.
Shadowheart,Let me help you.<br><br>
Shadowheart,Not leaving you behind.
Shadowheart,I'll help you.<br>
Shadowheart,I'll get you.
Shadowheart,"Don't give up, I'm coming.<br>"
Shadowheart,Stay with me.<br>
Shadowheart,"Hold tight, I'm coming."
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, I'm coming."
Shadowheart,"It's all right, help's on the way."
Shadowheart,Why even bother with this one?
Shadowheart,Waste of my skills.
Shadowheart,"Need a lot of propping up, don't you?"
Shadowheart,Try to not waste this.
Shadowheart,Maybe this'll make you useful.
Shadowheart,"Come on, stop slacking."
Shadowheart,Need a pick-me-up?
Shadowheart,Ssh... this'll make it better.
Shadowheart,Pain begone.
Shadowheart,Where does it hurt?
Shadowheart,This'll make you feel better.
Shadowheart,Away with the pain.
Shadowheart,You'll feel better in no time.
Shadowheart,Let me take the edge off the pain.
Shadowheart,"This'll help, friend."
Shadowheart,Wounds'll soon be forgotten.
Shadowheart,"Hold tight, I'll get you."
Shadowheart,I've got your back.<br>
Shadowheart,"No, I'll stay. I'd rather know exactly what you're up to."
Shadowheart,"Come on, get up.<br>"
Shadowheart,Up you get.<br><br>
Shadowheart,Let's end this.
Shadowheart,Got to concentrate.<br>
Shadowheart,"Dark Lady, help me strike true."
Shadowheart,Let's finish this.
Shadowheart,Need to act fast.
Shadowheart,Can't give up.<br>
Shadowheart,Got to focus.
Shadowheart,Talk to me.
Shadowheart,Got to keep fighting.
Shadowheart,Can't afford to let up.<br>
Shadowheart,What's the plan?
Shadowheart,Need to stay focused.<br>
Shadowheart,Darkness protect me.
Shadowheart,What should I do?
Shadowheart,My faith will protect me.
Shadowheart,Can't give up. Not now.
Shadowheart,Attacking's the best defence.
Shadowheart,Time to meet your end.
Shadowheart,Darkness smite you.
Shadowheart,"Dark Lady, let me strike true."
Shadowheart,Better start a conversation.
Shadowheart,"Worth talking to, perhaps."
Shadowheart,Let's see what's to be said.
Shadowheart,Onward.<br><br>
Shadowheart,"Get up, you're needed."
Shadowheart,Got to press on.
Shadowheart,Have to keep going.
Shadowheart,"Hold on, I'm coming.<br>"
Shadowheart,I'll help.<br>
Shadowheart,Worth a shot.<br>
Shadowheart,This'll make things interesting.
Shadowheart,Use every advantage.
Shadowheart,Might give me an edge.
Shadowheart,This'll ruin someone's day.
Shadowheart,"My need's greater, anyway."
Shadowheart,Time for a little pilfering.
Shadowheart,What's theirs shall be mine.
Shadowheart,Simply begging to be robbed.
Shadowheart,Might as well help myself.
Shadowheart,Let's see what I can spirit away.
Shadowheart,Time for a boost.
Shadowheart,Chin up. This'll help.
Shadowheart,You need a pick-me-up.
Shadowheart,You need some support.
Shadowheart,Anything to help.
Shadowheart,This'll boost you.
Shadowheart,"Let me help, please."
Shadowheart,This'll raise your spirits.
Shadowheart,On I go.<br>
Shadowheart,Got to move.
Shadowheart,Heading there.
Shadowheart,"The Mother Superior raised all of this from nothing, in secret. It took years."
Shadowheart,Karlach? Talk to me - what's the matter?
Shadowheart,Charming. She mustn't have nursed him enough as a child - or too much.
Shadowheart,"Might be worth talking to some of the gnome slaves - before they're worked to death, that is."
Shadowheart,Charming - and slave drivers to boot. Might be worth talking to the gnomes before they're worked to death.
Shadowheart,There could be scores of duergar here. Let's not pick a fight until we know how the odds are stacked.
Shadowheart,Let's try and keep this diplomatic. I'd rather not jump into another fight quite so soon.
Shadowheart,"We showed mercy to a mind flayer, and now a whole family's paid the price."
Shadowheart,"No surprises that there's danger ahead, but we're getting closer. Perhaps we should seek out Nere while we can, though."
Shadowheart,"Sounds like the shadow curse. We must be getting close to Moonrise. Perhaps we should seek out this Nere while we can, though."
Shadowheart,Let's just hope you're right. Otherwise we're just aiding the enemy.
Shadowheart,"Good. After all we've been through, this is hardly the time to falter."
Shadowheart,"No surprises that there's danger ahead, but at least we're getting closer. Leave Nere to rot - we should press on."
Shadowheart,Seems we'll have to free Nere before we can collect the bounty on his head.
Shadowheart,Sounds like the shadow curse. We must be getting close. Forget Nere and the Moonlantern -  let's just press on.
Shadowheart,Moonrise? There's a lot resting on what we find in that place. It had better deliver.
Shadowheart,"Hmph. Not the most sophisticated way of getting what you want from someone, is it?"
Shadowheart,"Careful - attack a slave, and you might have to answer to the slave master."
Shadowheart,"If I was that slave, I'd be tempted to add a dash of something poisonous to their drinks."
Shadowheart,Fool. He should've used the threat of the cane over the cane itself. Now those beasts are ready to charge.
Shadowheart,Adamantine. We must be nearing the forge.
Shadowheart,An idol of Lady Shar. It's beautiful... Curious that I found it. Not the first sign of the Dark Lady's power that I've encountered.
Shadowheart,An idol of Lady Shar. It cannot be a coincidence that I found this... All these signs of a Sharran presence. Dark Justiciars.
Shadowheart,A beautiful idol - crafted with reverence.
Shadowheart,An idol of Lady Shar? It's beautiful...
Shadowheart,Jaheira? Can't say I know the name.
Shadowheart,Really? Save your prayers for someone who at least had the spine to fight back.
Shadowheart,At least try to find out something of use before you kill them.
Shadowheart,That place in the distance... it can only mean one thing. Dark Justiciars. I just know it.
Shadowheart,Sounds rather ingenious.
Shadowheart,What are you playing at...?
Shadowheart,"If her powers were worth anything, we wouldn't have beaten her. Finish this."
Shadowheart,We've suffered her trickery long enough - end this.
Shadowheart,Don't help them. Don't tell them a thing. We're dead if you do.
Shadowheart,He can afford it - he's got one less mouth to feed now.<br>
Shadowheart,I'm inclined to agree. Let's not involve ourselves in this place any more than necessary.
Shadowheart,"If we recovered those explosives, we could free Thulla's friends with one blast, then move on."
Shadowheart,Sounds like an unnecessary risk to me. Though that hasn't stopped us before.
Shadowheart,Is this the Moonlantern...?
Shadowheart,Broken. So much for protection from the shadow curse.
Shadowheart,Broken. And there's dust inside it...
Shadowheart,Dark Justiciar uniforms... these were Shar worshippers - the same as me.
Shadowheart,Dark Justiciar uniforms... these were Shar worshippers - her most elite warriors. Curious.
Shadowheart,Watch your tongue - these were my brethren.
Shadowheart,"I'm sure they'd consider the feeling mutual, if they could."
Shadowheart,"As you like. Hopefully my own remains are treated with a little more dignity, when the time comes..."
Shadowheart,Indeed. We will avenge them if we can. And who knows? Perhaps other children of Shar are still to be found down here...  
Shadowheart,As you like. But don't presume whatever killed them is a thing of the past. Some battles span centuries.
Shadowheart,"That almost looks like... no, it couldn't be, surely..."
Shadowheart,What is that place in the distance? It looks almost Sharran...
Shadowheart,"That place in the distance - it's huge, and dedicated to Lady Shar. It can only mean one thing. Dark Justiciars. I just know it.<br>"
Shadowheart,That place in the distance... what is it?<br>
Shadowheart,I suppose we should aid him... though I'd hate to miss the show.
Shadowheart,"If you're expecting me to drop to my knees before you, forget it."
Shadowheart,"You can sacrifice yourself first, you spineless rat!"
Shadowheart,That thing's tainted. Better to leave it than bear a dead man's grudges.
Shadowheart,"That was more than he strictly needed to know. You're not intending to surrender her over to him, are you...?"
Shadowheart,Pity Gale isn't here. This is just his sort of place.
Shadowheart,Find someplace else to stand. You may meet with an unfortunate accident if you linger here.
Shadowheart,"Let's spare the both of us the bother, shall we? Whoever you think I am... I'm not her."
Shadowheart,"Ah, my apparent long-lost acquaintance. Here to wax lyrical about all the good times we didn't share?"
Shadowheart,No. Should I?
Shadowheart,"As long as you show Lady Shar all due respect, you'll be treated accordingly. Now, unless there's something else..."
Shadowheart,"You're a strange one. On your way, then."
Shadowheart,Walk away - now. Try anything like that again and you'll find your guest privileges can be revoked very quickly.
Shadowheart,What the...? The Hells do you think you're doing?!
Shadowheart,"Curious, this one. They seem a touch confused. Mother Superior must have some use for them."
Shadowheart,"Of course I am. Now unless you've any other dazzling insights to share, I think we're done here."
Shadowheart,"Dark Lady as my witness, I have no idea what you're talking about. I think we're done here."
Shadowheart,"I don't have a favourite flower. Perhaps there's another Shadowheart out there, that you're confusing me with."
Shadowheart,"Pretty, whatever it is. But if you're seeking to court me, I'm afraid I'm busy."
Shadowheart,"Oh is that so? That's quite an imagination you have - are you a bard, granted entry to our Grotto in order to regale us with ballads and tall tales?"
Shadowheart,I've never clapped eyes on you in my life. Did one of the others put you up to this? Tell you my name and see if you could get a rise out of me? 
Shadowheart,I take it you're here at the Mother Superior's invitation - no outsider would have made it this far without permission.
Shadowheart,Lady Shar's blessings be upon you.
Shadowheart,A disquietening place... but you must inflict pain in order to end pain. Lady Shar's embrace can soothe all mortal torments.
Shadowheart,"I learned how to inflict pain here, for Lady Shar. I can't remember the faces... but I think I can still hear the screams."
Shadowheart,Quiet in here now. But it wasn't always so. Screams rang off these walls. I swear I can almost hear them.
Shadowheart,"I... I think I might have hurt people here. Learned how to break their bodies, their spirits..."
Shadowheart,"She deserves better than to fall into his clutches. I owe her, in a sense."
Shadowheart,Dark Justiciars? I must see for myself.
Shadowheart,We can't do that - not after the lengths I already went through with her.
Shadowheart,Damn it. So much for using that thing to protect us.
Shadowheart,"I never thought I'd become a fungal errand girl, yet here I am."
Shadowheart,"Paragons of hospitality, these myconids. The druids in the grove could've learned a thing or two.<br>"
Shadowheart,That voice... what was that?
Shadowheart,"Careful... If we can hear it, perhaps it can hear us..."
Shadowheart,"Such faculties of observation you possess! I'm ready, whatever's coming..."
Shadowheart,"That thing better work. If it doesn't, I doubt you'll be in any position to complain..."
Shadowheart,I sincerely hope you never find employment as an executioner.
Shadowheart,More busywork? That's royalty for you - everyone's their servant.
Shadowheart,"If I die down here, destroy my corpse."
Shadowheart,Careful. I'd rather not have to pick bits of gnome from my hair.
Shadowheart,I'm not sure I blame her. Though Laridda might.
Shadowheart,"Hardly the time for a repast. Later, maybe..."
Shadowheart,"Eating strange mushrooms can be dangerous, you know. At least let's talk about it first..."
Shadowheart,Chin up - I'll wager they'll come back as soon as we move away from here.
Shadowheart,"That's the spirit. Now let's get moving, before anything else goes missing."
Shadowheart,"No harm in a brief dose of perspective. It'll pass, I'm sure."
Shadowheart,Perhaps this will cure you of some self-delusion then. Come on.
Shadowheart,So what do you have left to contribute? Your personality? Let's just hope those powers return soon.
Shadowheart,"You've no flair for insults. Let's go, before I'm tempted to give you a lesson."
Shadowheart,Or perhaps they found a better life with a new owner. Time will tell.
Shadowheart,"That's usually my line. Suddenly seems unconvincing, hearing it from someone else."
Shadowheart,"Your business is mine, and vice versa. We're relying on each other, remember?"
Shadowheart,What's the matter? I could swear this plant's got you flush.
Shadowheart,Nere's as good as dead without us... let's just hope his whispers don't reach any True Souls.
Shadowheart,Say we'll take over. His work is sloppy; he'll kill the prisoner too quickly.
Shadowheart,"Not the worst technique, priest. Good wrist movement, lots of enthusiasm..."
Shadowheart,"Better not let too much be spilled. As much as I'm enjoying the show, we may still need them afterwards."
Shadowheart,"The next time you want to pay gold to be called a fool, come see me."
Shadowheart,"People like you indeed. Idiots, I assume she means."
Shadowheart,I'd be more pleased if you joined them...
Shadowheart,You're welcome to try.
Shadowheart,I can compromise... just this once.
Shadowheart,I could get used to this...
Shadowheart,"You know, I had a dream just like this once."
Shadowheart,"Next time you feel like wasting gold, I'll happily unburden you of it myself."
Shadowheart,"Leave it. Whoever's inside doesn't want an audience, and I don't want a fight."
Shadowheart,Curious. Why don't you take a closer look... I'll observe from back here.<br>
Shadowheart,Please. Any supposed new god would have an uphill battle.
Shadowheart,He won't be of much help to us now.
Shadowheart,A dead elf? This must be the druid Halsin.
Shadowheart,"That dead elf - Halsin, I assume. He won't be helping anyone now..."
Shadowheart,"'The pits'...? He couldn't be somewhere pleasant-sounding, could he? Better still be alive."
Shadowheart,What do I say? Melon... donkey... sunrise? Whichever words will get you to leave me out of this.
Shadowheart,"I say you'd better start looking for your true love, because it's not me."
Shadowheart,"Love, is it? I hadn't realised I'd bowled you over that much. Give it a try, then - impress me."
Shadowheart,I see. Are you sure you don't want to quit while you're behind?
Shadowheart,I would never!
Shadowheart,"You didn't do abysmally, I suppose. That's worth something."
Shadowheart,A perfect score - I'm flattered. Have you been studying up on me every night at camp?
Shadowheart,I didn't think a little game would sting so much when I agreed to this... but you're right.
Shadowheart,You chose well. We have enough burdens as it is without taking on more.
Shadowheart,Hardly. My association with you might be a contender after that attempt...
Shadowheart,Let's not forget why we're here. No point in wasting precious time on a lost cause.
Shadowheart,Blasted thing... how do you open it? Does it even open?<br>
Shadowheart,It doesn't seem aware a few of the rules were bent a tad...
Shadowheart,"I'm glad. Provided we survive, there's plenty of nights yet to come."
Shadowheart,"While it's a fascinating prospect, I'd like you all to myself... at least the first time."
Shadowheart,Should I be jealous? At least you have good taste.<br>
Shadowheart,There's an idea. If you're comfortable sharing... so am I.
Shadowheart,"Fine, hog them all to yourself. Perhaps I'll find amusement elsewhere.<br>"
Shadowheart,I won't pretend the thought hasn't crossed my mind once or twice... or more than that.
Shadowheart,"A goblin healer. We really are desperate, aren't we?"
Shadowheart,That mural... they look like Dark Justiciars.
Shadowheart,That mural... it shows Dark Justiciars. Another sign of their presence.
Shadowheart,That mural shows Dark Justiciars. All these signs can't be a coincidence.
Shadowheart,So many dead. Sent to the Nightsinger's embrace.
Shadowheart,A temple of Shar? Where? And what's this about a curse?
Shadowheart,"The Shar temple is one thing, but what's this about a shadow curse?"
Shadowheart,How heroic. I was wondering if we'd survive encountering such a fearsome beast.
Shadowheart,Very mercenary of you. I wouldn't have done it any differently.
Shadowheart,Sounds like she made the fatal mistake of getting caught. We shouldn't get involved.
Shadowheart,Something doesn't add up about this one. Don't tell her anything.
Shadowheart,Nicely done. I hope you're intending to share.
Shadowheart,Keep talking. Nothing to be gained in picking a fight with a fanatic.
Shadowheart,Good. Play nice until we get what we need.<br>
Shadowheart,"Ugh, no matter. As long as I keep the damn thing safe.<br>"
Shadowheart,There must be something I can learn from it.<br>
Shadowheart,These glyphs aren't any language I recognise...<br>
Shadowheart,Give her a moment.
Shadowheart,"Not completely off the mark, but there's easier paths into my good graces..."
Shadowheart,Well put. Though I'll forgive a middling wine so long as the company makes up the difference...
Shadowheart,"I... I am a servant of Shar. My home is a secret cloister in Baldur's Gate. I need to bring that artefact back there, no matter what."
Shadowheart,I can't tell you any more. This mission required utmost secrecy - we all submitted to having our memories suppressed so that we couldn't betray Shar's confidence.
Shadowheart,"If I reach my contact in the city, I'll have my memories restored. Until then, I have to guard the artefact with my life."
Shadowheart,"There - you have the truth, for all it's worth. Let's continue."
Shadowheart,There's nothing more I can tell you. All I remember is that I have to get back to my contact in the city.
Shadowheart,"Yes, and a lot of my people died in the process. I won't fail them - not after what I saw your kind do to them."
Shadowheart,"I just saved you. Keep that in mind, next time you want to air your grievances."
Shadowheart,Agreed. There's too much at stake for petty squabbles.
Shadowheart,"Trust me, I'll guard it with my life. Let's keep going."
Shadowheart,"I wouldn't quite say that, but it'll be safe with me. Let's go."
Shadowheart,Out of the question. This is my mission - I won't just give it away.
Shadowheart,Then go ahead. It won't change what I have to say to you.
Shadowheart,"I told you already, now forget it. Let's keep going."
Shadowheart,I imagine you must have questions. We should talk.
Shadowheart,"Would you have joined up with her if you'd known she'd be indulging in this sort of thing, Astarion?"
Shadowheart,"Would you have joined up with him if you'd known he'd be indulging in this sort of thing, Astarion?"
Shadowheart,"Would you have joined up with them if you'd known they'd be indulging in this sort of thing, Astarion?<br>"
Shadowheart,"Don't wear him out entirely, priest. I might have use for him yet."
Shadowheart,"Don't wear her out entirely, priest. I might have use for her yet."
Shadowheart,"Don't wear them out entirely, priest. I might have use for them yet."
Shadowheart,Try not to lick your lips as you say that.
Shadowheart,"Better not let too much be spilled. As much as I'm enjoying the show, we may still need him afterwards."
Shadowheart,"Better not let too much be spilled. As much as I'm enjoying the show, we may still need her afterwards."
Shadowheart,Because it was our mission to retrieve it - me and... the others. I'm the only one who made it.
Shadowheart,Very good. (Just don't say it so loud.)
Shadowheart,A group of us were sent to retrieve the artefact. Now I'm the only one left. I can't afford to fail.
Shadowheart,"My home - a cloister of Shar followers, hidden in the city. "
Shadowheart,"It can't hurt, I suppose - unless you embarrass me. Then you might find yourself hurting in a whole manner of ways."
Shadowheart,I'm glad you volunteered - I didn't want to have to shove you forward in my place.
Shadowheart,I'd advise you find someone to taste your food from now on.
Shadowheart,Are you quite sure you have a friend called Shadowheart? Not an enemy?
Shadowheart,"Gods, I hate clowns. I'm not even sure clowns like clowns.<br>"
Shadowheart,"That disfigurement has its benefits, it seems."
Shadowheart,You're braver than I've supposed. Wash your mouth if you get a chance.
Shadowheart,Impressive. Though I'm not sure I want to know why you're so skilled at... that.
Shadowheart,Kiss the damn foot. Worse things have been shoved in your face lately.
Shadowheart,Best not leave any loose ends. This one might reward mercy with backstabbing.
Shadowheart,I didn't realise we were here to make friends.
Shadowheart,Nicely done. I probably couldn't have resisted kicking him in the teeth.
Shadowheart,"Good. We've had enough party games now, I think."
Shadowheart,"Understandable then, I suppose. Give him an extra kick for me, child."
Shadowheart,"That's a bigger fight than we needed to pick - not the subtlest of assassins, are you?"
Shadowheart,None of her friends around... Perfect time for a little discreet knifework.
Shadowheart,Don't give me that look. I don't know what just happened any more than you do. We should keep going.
Shadowheart,I think that was the Absolute speaking to us... but we managed to shield ourselves. We should keep moving.
Shadowheart,I'm not sure I want to know - but it's gone now. We should keep moving.
Shadowheart,Agreed.
Shadowheart,"Perhaps, but whatever it was, I don't want to experience it again."
Shadowheart,"Trust me, I will. Let's keep going."
Shadowheart,I don't know... not exactly. All I know is it's important I get it back to Baldur's Gate. At any cost.
Shadowheart,"I suppose if we're to continue together, I may as well tell you. I serve Shar. My home is a secret cloister in Baldur's Gate. "
Shadowheart,"Hmm, you feel a little more substantial than before. Less camping and scrounging off the land, I take it?"
Shadowheart,Only if you leave me feeling lightheaded.
Shadowheart,"Same - in fact, I found a nice meadow not far from where I live now. Every now and again, I'll spend the night there. For old time's sake."
Shadowheart,What can I say? They were eye-catching. Consider me an art-lover.
Shadowheart,"Quite the understatement, but yes - I have it. And I'll guard it with my life."
Shadowheart,Because it's important to my goddess. I was part of a group sent to claim the artefact in her name - and I'm the only survivor.
Shadowheart,"Because it just is. Trust breeds candour, so for now, that's all you need to know."
Shadowheart,Then so be it - I did my duty. As for the artefact... it's powerful. And has a mind of its own sometimes. You'd better hope you're up to bearing it.
Shadowheart,"Don't forget what it was like, when you heard the voice. It'll only get worse if you don't have the artefact to protect you."
Shadowheart,It's called faith. Duty. It doesn't have to add up to me so long as I serve. I'm part of a bigger plan - one that will be revealed in time.
Shadowheart,"I told you already - I surrendered my memories, for the sake of the mission. "
Shadowheart,"Shar's secrets must be protected - duty demands it. Once I fulfil my mission, I can have my memories restored."
Shadowheart,"Because it's safer that way. We had our memories suppressed before the mission - that way, none of us could betray the Dark Lady if we were captured."
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, it's not information I share too casually. Besides, those murals looked old; the druids have more current troubles to worry about."
Shadowheart,"How cynical. I should borrow that line sometime. But if I have to die, so be it. Like I said - faith."
Shadowheart,"I get to return home. Shar is the only one who's ever offered me a place in this world. If I succeed, I'll be closer to her than ever."
Shadowheart,"Shar's favour is all the reward I need. She made a place for me where no one else would. If I succeed, I can return to it, and be even closer to her."
Shadowheart,"I was part of a group sent by my cloister. We were to take the artefact from the githyanki and bring it to Baldur's Gate, no matter the cost."
Shadowheart,Though it turned out the cost was very steep. I was the only one of the group to survive - I took the artefact and fled... only to be ensnared by mind flayers before I could finish the mission.
Shadowheart,"I suppose if we're going to keep helping each other, I might as well tell you... I was part of a group sent to retrieve it, bring it to Baldur's Gate, for our goddess..."
Shadowheart,"I worship Shar, the Mistress of the Night. It's my mission to deliver the artefact to her secret cloister in Baldur's Gate."
Shadowheart,It's not the sort of thing I can just tell anyone. Let's see if we can build up some trust first.
Shadowheart,Like I said before - it's not the sort of thing I can tell just anyone. Maybe with time... or maybe not.
Shadowheart,"It's reciprocal, trust me. We need each other... Once we're cured, well, our partnership can end, if that's what you wish."
Shadowheart,"But make no mistake - when the time comes, the artefact leaves with me."
Shadowheart,"That's not a luxury open to many people, us included. I have my faith to turn to instead. You should find something of your own."
Shadowheart,The mural is propaganda - who is to say what truly happened. Though it is known that the Dark Justiciars have been silent for years.
Shadowheart,Nobody knows what became of them. Perhaps the battle in the mural wiped them out... but I'm not so sure.
Shadowheart,"Curious, to see them depicted in such a place. Perhaps there is more to it... but there's nothing to be done about it just now."
Shadowheart,Perhaps... but they could just as easily mean nothing. Those ruins seemed to be Sharran in nature - at least from what I could see at that distance. 
Shadowheart,"If we're able to find a way to get closer later on, well, I'll be very interested in seeing what's down there."
Shadowheart,I do. Remember the Dark Justiciars I told you about? I can't imagine those ruins are just a coincidence.
Shadowheart,"Speaking plainly, this isn't the first sign I've come across of a Sharran presence since we've been journeying together. I can't ignore them forever."
Shadowheart,"I do. If there's more worth sharing, you'll be the first to know. Trust me."
Shadowheart,"It might all be a coincidence... but between those ruins, and the signs I saw of Dark Justiciars before? It might be much more."
Shadowheart,"Not just yet - I wouldn't want to get my hopes up. If we can get any closer, and if there's anything more to that place, well... I think I'll have plenty to say then."
Shadowheart,Perhaps not just any Sharran ruins... remember the Dark Justiciars I spoke of before? Might be a coincidence. Might not.
Shadowheart,"We've encountered other signs of a Sharran presence during our time together. I need to understand what it all means. Indulge me, if you can. Please."
Shadowheart,Don't be nervous. I'll be there to protect you.
Shadowheart,Just a useful landmark to get our bearings with. I'm not keen on taking wrong turns in the Underdark.
Shadowheart,"Everything, potentially. There is scarcely a greater way to fully dedicate yourself to Lady Shar - save perhaps if you become the head of her church."
Shadowheart,"To become a Dark Justiciar is to become the Nightsinger's sword arm - her implement with which she will cast down the unbelievers and win the final battle to restore her perfect, endless darkness..."
Shadowheart,It's all I ever wanted. I prayed it was my calling.
Shadowheart,But 'Mother' forbid me from seeking to prove myself worthy of the rank. She said I was not ready.
Shadowheart,They just reminded me of something half-forgotten... it seemed to depict Lady Shar's warriors in combat. I hadn't known they were active in these parts.
Shadowheart,You know me. I'm not usually one to elaborate if I can avoid it.
Shadowheart,"Not formidable enough to win the battle, it seems. But still, worthy of my respect."
Shadowheart,Once being a long time ago - those murals were hardly recent. I think we all have more current troubles to worry about.
Shadowheart,They looked like Dark Justiciars - an elite force among Lady Shar's ranks. Only the very finest proved themselves worthy of the title.
Shadowheart,What right-minded servant of Lady Shar wouldn't? But it's a distant dream - the Dark Justiciars have been silent for years.
Shadowheart,"There was a proving ground of sorts. A place where initiates sought to complete Lady Shar's trials, and make a sacrifice in her name. But that place is lost now. Some even wonder if it ever truly existed."
Shadowheart,Still... to join their ranks would be an honour almost beyond measure. I can but dream...
Shadowheart,"You could say that... and yes, I still have it."
Shadowheart,"Often I think I feel her influence, when the wound pains me. Not even memories, just... glimpses, impressions. Perhaps the wound is her doing; something Lady Shar bid her to do. I don't know."
Shadowheart,There's something I want to talk to you about. Something important.
Shadowheart,"Must there be? I've learned to live with it. It's fine, I swear."
Shadowheart,"Of course. From the first time I laid eyes on you, right until now. That's all safe - I wouldn't surrender even a moment of it."
Shadowheart,"I do. The Mother Superior will have ordered them to keep watch for my return. Find one, and we discover what comes next."
Shadowheart,"Not quite. Above all else, protecting our base of operations in Baldur's Gate was the reason I had to surrender my memories to begin with... or at least, that's what I was led to believe."
Shadowheart,"We should look for someone to point me in the right direction, otherwise we'll have little recourse but to wander the whole city, searching."
Shadowheart,"I know what you mean. And under different circumstances, I'd like that too. But first things first, I'm afraid."
Shadowheart,"Wyrm's Crossing is a chokepoint - if I wanted to intercept a new arrival, I'd find somewhere before the bridge, blend in amongst the crowds, and wait."
Shadowheart,Most people seeking entry to the city will be refugees. I'd look wherever they're gathering.
Shadowheart,"Difficult to say. I've strayed from my original mission, but Lady Shar has given me a new one. Time will tell if my peers recognise that... the Mother Superior has a tight grip on them - one that I intend to break."
Shadowheart,"If by warm, you perhaps mean a flaming arrow? I doubt they'll attack in public. No, I expect they'll point me in the right direction so I can face my reckoning away from prying eyes."
Shadowheart,"It's overwhelming - like a lifetime's worth of nightmares, unleashed all at once upon waking. I can barely untangle one moment from another - not that I even want to."
Shadowheart,I just know that my heart sinks if I let my thoughts wander to them...
Shadowheart,"Perhaps. But in the meanwhile, I'll just have to find a way to live with them."
Shadowheart,"Shar seeks to break people, to fill their lives with despair, so that they will turn to her for relief. Perhaps she thought this would lead me back to her in time..."
Shadowheart,But it won't. I fought too hard to win my freedom - I will not give it up again. No matter how much it hurts.
Shadowheart,I spoke to my father already. It was difficult... but I think it helped. I'm better equipped to deal with my past now.
Shadowheart,"Yes... but it's not an easy subject to broach. Those bad memories... they're filled with my parents' faces, their cries of pain. But perhaps it will help, if I can clear the air..."
Shadowheart,That graffiti from before - I never thought I'd see it again...
Shadowheart,Well... I think I was the one who did it.
Shadowheart,I can recognise my own handwriting... how long ago was this? Years?
Shadowheart,"All the time I spent training, hidden away from the world. I think... I think I must have wanted to leave my mark somewhere - just to prove I existed. Even to myself..."
Shadowheart,It was to me - I think I was the one who did it.
Shadowheart,"The final sacrifice has been made. I am Lady Shar's right hand now. It has all been worth it - every step, every trial, every drop of blood..."
Shadowheart,None. She sealed her own fate - I was merely Lady Shar's instrument in delivering the final blow.
Shadowheart,"You've been with me all this time... you know exactly what I've sacrificed to achieve this. I had hoped you'd learned to not try and sour my relationship with Lady Shar, but clearly not. Let us speak no more of this."
Shadowheart,I suppose we can manage that...
Shadowheart,What in life isn't? I consider myself blessed to have a goddess guide my very mind.
Shadowheart,"Anything that's missing... well, I can't miss what I can't remember. I have all I need."
Shadowheart,"I... I think so, but I don't know why. That name on the tomb meant nothing to me, yet I felt a pang of loss all the same."
Shadowheart,"You'd be surprised - not all of us don robes and dark armour. Some people live perfectly normal lives on the surface, blending in utterly, so that they can serve the Dark Lady in utter secrecy."
Shadowheart,"And not every skill that the Dark Lady asks of her followers can be taught in the shadows. Some can only be mastered on the streets, in daylight, amidst crowds."
Shadowheart,"Lying, tailing, observing without being seen, picking a purse without being felt... I think I must have been sent to learn all these things from the man in that grave."
Shadowheart,"'Allister Marnley'. Sounds human, and the grave wasn't recent. He must have died some time ago. And I mourned him already."
Shadowheart,"He'd surely not have been buried here if he was exposed - he must have taken the secret of his faith to the grave, undiscovered. A very Sharran ending."
Shadowheart,"I think I knew that man. I think he helped me somehow, long ago, and I grieved when he died."
Shadowheart,"Not all of Sharrans don robes and dark armour. Some people live perfectly normal lives on the surface, blending in utterly, so that they can serve the Dark Lady in utter secrecy."
Shadowheart,"That's a question that could take a lifetime to answer. Lady Shar's followers are my responsibility now. I will need to guide them, and root out any heresy that Viconia sowed."
Shadowheart,But all that must wait for now - the Nightsinger's church cannot thrive if the Absolute isn't stopped.
Shadowheart,"When the time comes for the final battle, Lady Shar's faithful will be ready. Until then, we should continue to do what we must."
Shadowheart,"I can very easily imagine I needed somewhere to escape to, if I was to survive."
Shadowheart,Nocturne and I must have come here a lot. We probably had plenty we wanted to hide from.
Shadowheart,"I don't think I was always alone there either... I remembered a friend, when I ate the noblestalk. I think we hid from our troubles, together."
Shadowheart,"I have the strangest feeling that I wasn't always alone there... don't ask me why, but I almost sense the conversations, the laughter. "
Shadowheart,Perhaps I had an imaginary friend. Wouldn't surprise me.
Shadowheart,"Anyway, I think that little hideaway helped shape who I am, as much as any sermon or training did. Funny, the things that influence you..."
Shadowheart,"Everything that's happened... Shar, my parents... it's almost too much to take in."
Shadowheart,You probably would have been well-rewarded by her if you hadn't just told me that. I owe you.
Shadowheart,"I... I haven't had a chance to figure that part out just yet. What happened barely feels real to me. I had my family back, for such a short time... and now they're gone again."
Shadowheart,"Give me a night, to try and get my head together."
Shadowheart,"Those that are worth remembering, yes. Lady Shar is ever-wise; she knows what I do and do not have to know in order to be her most loyal, most effective servant:"
Shadowheart,"My training knowledge, my experiences, my will and faith... everything I need to be leader of the cloister."
Shadowheart,"Not as much as I am. My whole life has been leading up to this. At last, I've become who I've always meant to be."
Shadowheart,I'm afraid my gratitude is all I have to offer.
Shadowheart,"I'm afraid my gratitude is all I have to offer... and a kiss, of course."
Shadowheart,"But kind patron, I am but a humble cleric - all I have belongs to my goddess."
Shadowheart,"I have to be ready to pay any cost that Lady Shar asks of me. If that troubles you, I'm sorry. But it cannot be changed."
Shadowheart,Let me guess... you're wondering why I was in pain before. Best if we just get the subject out of the way now...
Shadowheart,"The grove sported some rather interesting murals, I must say..."
Shadowheart,Something the matter? Wait - 
Shadowheart,A joyous little affliction that visits me with screaming agony on occasion. I'd be lying if I told you I know what causes it...
Shadowheart,But don't worry - it can't hurt you. Only me.
Shadowheart,Worse. But it passes quickly. Usually.
Shadowheart,I know that look - you're wondering why I was in pain before. Let's just clear the air about that now.
Shadowheart,"There's something I've been wanting to share with you, if now's a good time..."
Shadowheart,"Wouldn't you be, in my place? If there's even the slightest chance that Shar worshippers remain within our reach, we should try and find them."
Shadowheart,Even if they're all long gone - and that seems quite likely from what we know - who knows what they might have left behind for us to use?
Shadowheart,My people are nothing if not resourceful.
Shadowheart,"Of course - we need every advantage we can grasp, and this Dark Justiciar stronghold sounds like an opportunity to me. We should look for it."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps they're still down there somewhere, but if not, who knows what they might've left behind for us to claim?"
Shadowheart,"Shar worshippers are nothing if not resourceful, I hear."
Shadowheart,"I was. He mentioned Dark Justiciars, and we've come across other signs of a Sharran presence during our travels. I'm not sure I can dismiss that as a coincidence."
Shadowheart,"I seem to recall fragments of tales about them - their prowess in battle, their unshakeable faith. I thought they were the stuff of legends. Perhaps not."
Shadowheart,"The wound on my hand. It never quite heals, and sometimes it causes terrible pain to rip through me. It's my burden though, from Lady Shar. I can feel her influence, somehow..."
Shadowheart,I'll try my best. But secrecy is ingrained in me. Lady Shar considers it greater protection than any shield or armour.
Shadowheart,"I cannot say - not with what I can recall. But even then, it would not be for me to question her will. Lady Shar has her reasons."
Shadowheart,"It's difficult to say... sometimes I wonder if it's supposed to be guiding me, punishing me, testing me... but perhaps it's none of those. Perhaps it's completely random."
Shadowheart,"I'd like to hope there's more to it than that - some meaning that Lady Shar will reveal to me, when the time is right. Until then, all I can do is endure.<br>"
Shadowheart,"It's less difficult than you might imagine, when you can't remember life without it."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps you're right... but there's little we can do about it just now. Maybe a way will present itself in time, if Lady Shar wills it."
Shadowheart,"I don't think so, but you're sweet to ask. Maybe just be patient the next time you see me wince or cry out - it'll pass quickly enough. It always does."
Shadowheart,"Everyone has to suffer - it's a fact of life. Until Lady Shar deems it is time. I know you mean well, but this is not something for you to fix."
Shadowheart,Pain is the gauntlet that all who love Lady Shar must endure. Only her embrace can truly heal me.
Shadowheart,There is scarcely a greater way to fully dedicate yourself to Lady Shar - save perhaps if you become the head of her church.
Shadowheart,"Not my mother-mother, I should add. The Mother Superior. Head of Lady Shar's enclave in Baldur's Gate."
Shadowheart,"Sometimes I wonder if she would ever deem me ready. I owe her everything, and I only wish to serve, yet she can prove... inscrutable. "
Shadowheart,"I don't know. Perhaps if I succeed in my mission, and reach Baldur's Gate. Hope has little place amongst Lady Shar's children - it is an illusion, a distraction. But for this... I hope my time will yet come."
Shadowheart,Dark Justiciars are hated by many - judged to be ruthless fanatics. Even the few who would accept a follower of Lady Shar would likely baulk at a Justiciar in their midst.
Shadowheart,"But there's a simpler answer to your question - I simply forgot about the desire I had, until I saw some things that reminded me. Now I can't get it out of my mind."
Shadowheart,"Fine, it can keep for a while yet."
Shadowheart,Yes. There's one more thing I wanted to share about myself. Something I think you deserve to know.
Shadowheart,It's difficult to put into words... I think it might be easier to just show you.
Shadowheart,Use the tadpole - the connection. Come into my mind.
Shadowheart,I'm sure. I trust you.
Shadowheart,How I came to be who I am. How I found my way to Lady Shar's embrace.
Shadowheart,That's all I remember.
Shadowheart,"She made me who I am... at least, as best as I can remember. She taught me, trained me, punished me when I failed her - which was often."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps I was. She sent me on this mission, after all."
Shadowheart,No doubt she feels the same way.
Shadowheart,"You're reading too much into things - a childhood bauble, that's all."
Shadowheart,"Just because Selûnites claim something, doesn't mean they own it."
Shadowheart,"Normally I'd agree, but with you... it's getting easier by the moment."
Shadowheart,I don't remember how it started. Only how it ended. I was fleeing.
Shadowheart,No... the opposite. I feel like I can share this with you. I've never felt that way before.
Shadowheart,"Honestly? Trust. I can't remember the last time I sought to confide in someone like this - maybe I never have, for all I know. But now it just feels... right."
Shadowheart,"Fine, if you insist."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps you're right... and perhaps one day I won't have to suffer. But I don't think that day has arrived yet. Lady Shar will ease my pain, when she wishes to."
Shadowheart,"Still, I learned much from the late Mother Superior. It was the least I could do to make that final blow a swift one."
Shadowheart,"Pain is sacred to followers of Lady Shar. Pain will give way to loss, and then to the peace of her eternal darkness. You can tolerate a great deal of suffering, so long as it has meaning."
Shadowheart,"It's nothing to do with the tadpoles at least, in case your imagination is in danger of getting away from you."
Shadowheart,I suppose I owe you my thanks - unlikely I'd have found this without you leading the way.
Shadowheart,"That structure we saw from a distance, in the Grymforge. Something about it struck me as noteworthy."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps we'll find an easier way to reach it, if we keep pressing forward."
Shadowheart,I... I can't. My memories are being withheld for a reason. Lady Shar will return them to me when the time is right. No sooner.
Shadowheart,"Besides, mushrooms aren't my favourite. I think it's because of the gills..."
Shadowheart,All right... give it here.
Shadowheart,"I remember... something. Not everything. It's new and not new at the same time, all jumbled up."
Shadowheart,I was younger. Much younger. An initiate at the cloister. I was upset about something... the others were teasing me. Mocking my name. Like I wasn't worthy of it...
Shadowheart,There was another. A tiefling boy with short horns and purple hair. I think he was my friend. He tried to make me feel better...
Shadowheart,"'Rennald'. That's the last part of it I remember... that must be his name. Perhaps he's still there, in Baldur's Gate."
Shadowheart,"I think so. I remember... something. Not everything. It's new and not new at the same time, all jumbled up."
Shadowheart,"I've given my answer - I'm not eating that thing. Go sell it, or make an omelette with it, for all I care."
Shadowheart,"What's your game, exactly? A Selûnite bearing gifts sounds like a trick if I ever heard one."
Shadowheart,You sound troublingly sincere... but thank you. I'll find this a place of honour at camp.
Shadowheart,"I suppose civility never killed anyone... well that's not true, but thank you. I'll find a place of honour..."
Shadowheart,You're no such thing. But I'm still keeping this... thank you.
Shadowheart,Easily done. How am I ever going to explain this in my prayers...?
Shadowheart,"You... you thought of me? Thank you, it's beautiful. I'll find a place of honour for it in camp."
Shadowheart,Nobody's ever given me anything before. What do I owe you in return?
Shadowheart,Thank you. Lady Shar teaches us to forswear material goods... but I think she'll make an exception for her own image.
Shadowheart,"Well, in that case, thank you. I'll always think of you when I look upon it - after I think of Lady Shar, of course."
Shadowheart,"But kind sir, I am but a humble cleric - all I have belongs to my goddess."
Shadowheart,"But kind madam, I am but a humble cleric - all I have belongs to my goddess."
Shadowheart,Perhaps I'm just grasping at straws... but I should keep watch for more signs.
Shadowheart,It's just an old wound that hurts me from time to time. Nothing to be concerned about.
Shadowheart,This isn't the first sign we've come across. It can't just be a coincidence - they had a presence in these lands once. I should keep watch for more signs.
Shadowheart,Thank you. I should have known you'd be understanding.
Shadowheart,It's just... something I have to live with.
Shadowheart,"Quite a lot, if I'm being honest. But it always passes quickly, so I can manage."
Shadowheart,Positive. You can trust me on that.
Shadowheart,I'm sure. 
Shadowheart,I know. I felt it.
Shadowheart,"I felt it go from me to you. You need its help, just as it needs us - it's still just a box, after all."
Shadowheart,You wouldn't have been able to take it. The artefact has a will of its own - it'd fight back if it didn't want to be with you.
Shadowheart,Might not be possible. It's stubborn that way - prone to lashing out. Keep it for now - we can all help to protect it.
Shadowheart,"The other way around, more like. The artefact goes with whom it wishes, and lashes out at anyone who tries to take it. Keep it for now - we can all help to protect it. "
Shadowheart,"But make no mistake - when the time comes, when we're cured - the artefact leaves with me."
Shadowheart,"The best I can do is stay close, bide my time... eventually I'll need to take it. Then I'll have to see what can be done about that."
Shadowheart,Don't be - it can't harm you. And as for me? Well... I'm used to it.
Shadowheart,Don't be. It's nothing to do with you.
Shadowheart,I told you already - it's none of your concern. 
Shadowheart,"There's no story. None that you're entitled to hear, anyway. Just forget you ever saw it."
Shadowheart,"It's not easily understood, in my experience. But I'll try."
Shadowheart,Apologies. I was less than forthcoming when you asked before. You didn't know about my faith - I wasn't sure how you'd react.
Shadowheart,Just an old wound that hurts every now and again. No need to make a fuss.
Shadowheart,Of course - I couldn't leave such a treasure behind. I'll find it a place of honour in the camp.
Shadowheart,I suppose I owe you thanks. I hadn't expected a Selûnite to lead me to such a beautiful piece. You're full of surprises.
Shadowheart,"In any case, it was certainly not what I expected to find in the Underdark."
Shadowheart,I wonder... perhaps this is connected to the Dark Justiciars. 
Shadowheart,"This is no coincidence, I'm sure of it. I need to keep an eye out for more signs - learn more about the Justiciars' presence in these lands. It could be important."
Shadowheart,"Why, thank you. Always nice to have you to tell me what is and isn't worthwhile."
Shadowheart,"As long as I've prayed to Lady Shar, I've wished to serve her as a Dark Justiciar."
Shadowheart,"She is alone and powerless. Lady Shar has denounced her, and her own followers have abandoned her. Perhaps she will come to regret her survival, but either way, I do not expect to see her again."
Shadowheart,"Nocturne has endured much in this place, and remained loyal to me. Once I have settled into my role, I shall see that whatever place she desires in Lady's Shar's service is hers."
Shadowheart,I understand. Feel free to have your fun. Perhaps I'll have mine.
Shadowheart,"I'm glad that understanding's been noticed. Hasn't always been the case with others, trust me."
Shadowheart,Deny yourself then. Just remember that I'm not the obstacle.
Shadowheart,"Was there anything else, besides your increasingly complex love life?"
Shadowheart,"Are you sure? He's large, granted. But I can squeeze in any number of places."
Shadowheart,"If you have a chance to climb Mount Halsin, well I'd be cruel to deny you. I'll be waiting to hear the details afterwards."
Shadowheart,"Must we? No harm in a little mystery, don't you think?"
Shadowheart,I should hope not. Have you ever heard the people who want to talk about themselves? I'm doing you a favour.
Shadowheart,Sweet of you... but don't worry - I'm sure you'll get to know me just fine by travelling together. No need for interrogations just yet.
Shadowheart,Say for a moment that I was. Do you think your blunt approach would get me to confess?
Shadowheart,My. You must find the city very appealing to be making those sorts of noises out in public...
Shadowheart,Good. I like you - and you did save my life. I wouldn't want to sour things between us - not while we need each other.
Shadowheart,A shame you feel that way. Just don't expect me to entertain your questions if you won't respect my privacy
Shadowheart,Thank you. I'm sure we'll get along perfectly well.
Shadowheart,"Easier's often less interesting. Besides, we've plenty of reason to rely on each other already - you can't confide in just anyone about a monster in your head."
Shadowheart,Conversation shouldn't be made - it should be grown. Let the seeds sprout in their own time.
Shadowheart,I suppose you've noticed I'm not terribly fond of wolves...
Shadowheart,Of course - but remember. Lady Shar comes first.
Shadowheart,You could fill several volumes with all that's happened to us. Perhaps the reminiscing should wait until the day is won... or not.
Shadowheart,"Hard to fathom really... all the way from that pod, through the wilds, and finally back to where it started for me."
Shadowheart,"It'll make for quite a bedtime tale for the children, if you ever get me in a family way."
Shadowheart,"It'll make quite a bedtime tale for the children - if I survive to have any, that is."
Shadowheart,Good. I like you - I wouldn't want to sour things between us. Not while we need each other.
Shadowheart,Of course. In the spirit of open-mindedness. I want to hear it all.
Shadowheart,I'm sure. Have your fun. Perhaps I'll have mine.
Shadowheart,"... luckily for you, I don't count among their number. If you have a chance to climb Mount Halsin, well I'd be cruel to deny you. I'll be waiting to hear the details afterwards."
Shadowheart,"She is my Mother. She nurtures me, cares for me, loves me."
Shadowheart,But you know all this of course. Only a pity that more don't reject the Selûnites' lies.
Shadowheart,"There's less truth in the moon witch's teachings than you've been led to believe, Selûnite."
Shadowheart,Don't believe the lies the Selûnites tell.
Shadowheart,"What, besides my life's calling and the greatest problem I've ever faced...?"
Shadowheart,Careful. Stealing the most precious item in this place is hardly going to go unnoticed...
Shadowheart,Well... I like night orchids and can't swim. Is that the sort of thing you meant?<br>
Shadowheart,It's a deal.
Shadowheart,It's nothing to laugh at. Save your questions if that's how you're going to react.
Shadowheart,No. I can't.
Shadowheart,"Quite literally, I mean. With my memories suppressed, I can't betray Shar's secrets... but I can't remember much of myself either."
Shadowheart,I mean... I literally can't. There's certain things I can't remember right now.
Shadowheart,You're the same as me. You know how important Shar's secrets are.
Shadowheart,Shar's secrets must be preserved above all else. All who worship her know this.
Shadowheart,I have had certain memories suppressed - voluntarily - so that I can serve Shar without compromising her.
Shadowheart,Careful. I doubt Raphael's associates dispense pleasures of the flesh out of charity. There's bound to be a catch.
Shadowheart,If I manage to return to Baldur's Gate and fulfil Shar's mission... then my memories will be restored.
Shadowheart,"That is not for me to share, even to a fellow child of Shar."
Shadowheart,That is not for you to know. Leave it at that.
Shadowheart,"I do as Shar asks of me. You would have done the same, I'm sure."
Shadowheart,"Of course. It is an act of faith - not to be undertaken lightly. Shar will reward me, when I succeed."
Shadowheart,"You're talking about Halsin, aren't you? I don't blame you. It'd take a cold heart and cobwebbed loins to ignore him. But what exactly did you have in mind?"
Shadowheart,Bold of you to ask. Some might take the suggestion very badly...
Shadowheart,"Honestly, I'm still surprised that we actually managed to defeat Ketheric Thorm. Perhaps a final victory isn't such a wild dream after all..."
Shadowheart,I'm not sure I can even think about that right now... I'm still wrapping my mind around what happened in the Shadowfell...
Shadowheart,Lady Shar has chosen me. Words can't convey how I feel. All I know is that I must prove her faith in me to be well-placed...
Shadowheart,You're the author of your own tale now - well done.
Shadowheart,"Thank you. And you're right, it's... a delicate matter. Not something for light conversation."
Shadowheart,Home. Baldur's Gate.
Shadowheart,"If you must know, Baldur's Gate."
Shadowheart,"We go our separate ways, of course - what else? The ties that bind would be well and truly severed."
Shadowheart,"We were brought together by circumstance. Besides, I have my own people in Baldur's Gate."
Shadowheart,"And before you ask, no. I'm not telling you what I'm doing there, or who I'm meeting, or anything else."
Shadowheart,"You pry too much. Any further, and you'll regret it, understand?"
Shadowheart,No notes. You've exceeded my every expectation.<br>
Shadowheart,"Even if I could have made it this far without you, I don't think I'd have wanted to."
Shadowheart,"Considering all we've been through, I think I was very lucky to find such favourable company. And attractive company too, no less."
Shadowheart,"Quite splendidly to give credit where it's due. You and I have shared some good times together, and it seems we have plenty in common..."
Shadowheart,You're a better catch than I'd expected to find while fighting for survival in the wilderness.
Shadowheart,"And think of how far we've come together - all the ways from the Hells, back to civilisation.<br>"
Shadowheart,"We've already made great strides - both in distance travelled, and in more personal matters..."
Shadowheart,"You're someone I can actually turn to, when I don't know what to do."
Shadowheart,Trust isn't something that comes easily to me. But with you... I think I can make an exception.
Shadowheart,"I don't think I've ever had a confidante quite like you - and if I have, I can't remember them."
Shadowheart,"I opened up to you like I have with no one before. We bonded... but it's been downhill from there. Perhaps we can rekindle things, or perhaps not..."
Shadowheart,Careful what you do with that thing...
Shadowheart,But I won't give up on you - not just yet. I'm my own worst enemy in that regard.
Shadowheart,I tried to wrest you from Bhaal's grip once already. Seems I failed.
Shadowheart,"I don't know what to say. You and I shared good times together... but it's been downhill from there. Perhaps we can rekindle things, or perhaps not..."
Shadowheart,"Besides, we've come so far now - the end isn't so distant. I may need to concentrate on what's truly important to me."
Shadowheart,"Let's just say it's a very personal, very private acquaintance. "
Shadowheart,"She took me in when no one else would. Without her, I wouldn't be alive."
Shadowheart,"There's someone waiting for me there. Someone I have to reach, as soon as possible."
Shadowheart,"I suppose we'd go our separate ways - not a slight on your company, of course."
Shadowheart,I'd be worm food if it wasn't for you. Thank you.
Shadowheart,"It's a lot to process - nautiloids, tadpoles, the escape, the wilderness... and now I've seen an entire land under the sway of Lady Shar's power."
Shadowheart,"Honestly, I think I'm caught for words."
Shadowheart,"'All that's happened.' You have a talent for understatement, you know that? Specifics, please."
Shadowheart,"We've been through quite a lot, with likely more to come. Care to narrow it down a little?"
Shadowheart,"Must I? Thinking about it won't help. We know what to do, so let's do it."
Shadowheart,"Personally, I think we should go to Moonrise Towers. From what Minthara said, that sounds like where we'll find answers."
Shadowheart,"Personally, I think Halsin's advice about getting to Moonrise sounds like the most promising option."
Shadowheart,"As for what he said about a Dark Justiciar stronghold in the Underdark... I'll need to see that for myself. If true - and Shar willing, it is - it could be invaluable to us."
Shadowheart,As for what he said about a Dark Justiciar stronghold in the Underdark... we should keep watch for it. Something tells me such a place could be of use to us.<br>
Shadowheart,"I'm not entirely sure I'd agree - in fact, I found a nice meadow not far from where I live now. Every now and again, I'll spend the night there. For old time's sake."
Shadowheart,"There's also Volo. If he's as knowledgeable as he boasts to be, perhaps he can help."
Shadowheart,Or there's Ethel. Not that I'm keen to trust her.
Shadowheart,"If we're truly desperate, we can try to convince that goblin, Gut, in assisting us."
Shadowheart,"As for this gith crèche, well... if your kind can actually save us, I stand to be corrected."
Shadowheart,"I'm not too hopeful that a gith crèche will actually prove our salvation, but worth keeping in mind."
Shadowheart,"There's Volo. If he's as knowledgeable as he boasts to be, perhaps he can help."
Shadowheart,We could speak to Ethel. Though I'm not keen to trust her.
Shadowheart,"There's this gith crèche, but, well... if your kind can actually save us, I stand to be corrected."
Shadowheart,"I'm not too hopeful that a gith crèche will actually prove our salvation, but worth keeping in mind.<br>"
Shadowheart,We've no solid leads right now though - we'd best get hunting.
Shadowheart,"If you discover anything that might help us, I'm all ears."
Shadowheart,"I will continue to serve Shar, of course. My path brings me to Baldur's Gate. Perhaps our paths will continue to intertwine, if the Dark Lady wills it. "
Shadowheart,"Perhaps, perhaps not. If we do survive, we'll have separate lives to return to. I need to get to Baldur's Gate."
Shadowheart,You already know my biggest secrets. What more can you ask?
Shadowheart,Don't be surprised if I'm reluctant to face any more.
Shadowheart,"You've been decent to me, so far. Maybe if you can... don't make me face any more of them. At least not alone."
Shadowheart,"The particulars of childhood can grow hazy, even if your memories haven't been tampered with. But I felt safe there - I know that much."
Shadowheart,"My parents. I saw them, spoke to them... and let them go. It's... it's more than I can take in, just now."
Shadowheart,"That name on the tombstone before - it meant nothing to me, yet I felt a pang of loss all the same..."
Shadowheart,"And as you're telling me this, I assume you intend to do no such thing? It seems my trust in you is well-placed."
Shadowheart,Perhaps I shouldn't expect the warmest of receptions when I return to my people - no doubt the Mother Superior seeks to cling to power.
Shadowheart,"But I must go there, all the same. And I'd better be prepared for anything."
Shadowheart,"I just hope you don't have a last-minute change of heart, and decide to take her offer after all."
Shadowheart,I should have anticipated the Mother Superior would try something like this; have me walk right into a trap.
Shadowheart,"Is that so? I'm a little surprised you decided to warn me - it must have been a scant bounty you were offered. Still, I should thank you."
Shadowheart,"So that's to say you'd like to pry a little? You do seem like the type, I must say."
Shadowheart,"Just an observation, no offence taken. See? We're learning something about each other already."
Shadowheart,"For instance, you're a quick-to-anger type, aren't you? Even less self-control than brains."
Shadowheart,Perhaps I should hire a bard to follow you around and make a constant racket then. Just to be safe.
Shadowheart,I jest. And hopefully you do as well. Shall we?
Shadowheart,"No harm at all, in fact..."
Shadowheart,Don't get too ahead of yourself. I'm just having a little fun.
Shadowheart,"Nor are you mine, as it stands. "
Shadowheart,But who's to say? I might need a distraction some evening. These campsites do get cold...
Shadowheart,Hrmph. I suppose. I also suppose I'll have to rely on myself to stave off boredom.
Shadowheart,There's more than one way to keep me warm. We'll see. Maybe.
Shadowheart,Was there something else?
Shadowheart,And I've revealed all I'm willing to - at least for now.
Shadowheart,"Now I suggest you let matters rest, or else we'd better part ways."
Shadowheart,"Maybe. Or maybe I already liked night orchids, and I chose that place because of them."
Shadowheart,Perhaps... not right now. As tempting as you make it sound.
Shadowheart,Don't tempt me. I might find it hard to leave.
Shadowheart,That little hideaway that we found in the cloister... it almost felt like I'd found a piece of my childhood. A childhood I don't truly remember.
Shadowheart,"That... that was always a fragile, elusive thing, ever since I slew Nightsong."
Shadowheart,"I did not want to surrender it then. Perhaps now, as first among Lady Shar's children, I can give myself leave to do as I like..."
Shadowheart,"I hope so. So long as I'm willing to stroll right into the Mother Superior's trap, they have no reason to not tell me where to go."
Shadowheart,"I need to reach its very centre, and confront the Mother Superior. Lady Shar decrees she is no longer fit to lead."
Shadowheart,"There will be plenty of others there too - if we can get them to see sense, I would rather we spare their lives. I don't want to lead a congregation of corpses like Balthazar and Ketheric."
Shadowheart,"Most are lost forever. Some may creep back into my mind, if I encounter anything that helps clear the fog... then there's what Shar did restore to me. Memories of pain, suffering. Both my own, and what I inflicted."
Shadowheart,"That... doesn't sound like the Mother Superior I remember. But then again, I can scarcely trust what I do remember."
Shadowheart,I trust you. Lead the way.
Shadowheart,"Everything that's happened... Shar, my parents... it's almost too much to take in.<br>"
Shadowheart,I... I thought we could have so much more together. All of us. But this is your choice.
Shadowheart,"Just wandering the streets is causing little things to come back to me. Just the barest crumbs of memories, but still... I suppose when you're famished, a crumb is a feast."
Shadowheart,"Oh, I'm well aware, trust me. In fact, as I remember so little the way things stand, all my fondest memories revolve around you."
Shadowheart,Honestly - and don't laugh - it's the smells. I never thought I'd be so glad to be greeted by the waft of docks and alleyways.
Shadowheart,"It doesn't dredge up any specifics... just a feeling I can't quite define. But it's a comforting feeling, all the same."
Shadowheart,By all means.
Shadowheart,That... doesn't sound like the Mother Superior I remember. Are you sure?
Shadowheart,"Well, can you imagine what it would have been like, growing up in that place? Endless training, no privacy, facing scorn wherever I looked..."
Shadowheart,Then that's where we need to go. My parents are in there somewhere. 
Shadowheart,That sounds like a trap if I ever heard one. 
Shadowheart,"All right. When you're ready, lead me there."
Shadowheart,"And she is no fool, from what I remember of her... all right. When you're ready, lead me there."
Shadowheart,"She could cut her losses far easier by just killing them. But trap or not, what choice do I have? When you're ready, lead me there."
Shadowheart,"You're right. I'm sorry - it's been difficult to take much for granted lately, especially when it comes to Sharrans. When you're ready, lead me there."
Shadowheart,"But remember it or not... I felt right at home there, surrounded by books and night orchids."
Shadowheart,Of course. What's the point in having power if you cannot wield it every now and again to help your friends?
Shadowheart,"Heh. You're like an eager, pale puppy. Let's not take things too fast..."
Shadowheart,"And secondly, no harm in trying something at least once. Even if you don't ultimately like it."
Shadowheart,Honestly? My heart's racing. The end's close - my parents are close. I just know it. Thank you - I'm not sure I would have ever made it this far without you.<br><br>
Shadowheart,"Honestly? My nerves are aflame - I'm almost home, and Lady Shar's final test awaits. Thank you - I'm not sure I would have ever made it this far without you.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Nervous, perhaps. When we entered Wyrm's Crossing, it felt like it might be the beginning of the end. Whatever happens, I'm glad it's with you next to me."
Shadowheart,"Thriving. Lady Shar's foes continue to fall, and she continues to honour me... but she wants me all to herself. What we share... may be difficult to maintain.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Better than I thought possible. I have done as Lady Shar wished, and she had rewarded me in turn. All is well... or almost. The Nightsinger wants my heart - all of it."
Shadowheart,Well... I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been dwelling on becoming a Dark Justiciar. Perhaps seeing the power of Shar unleashed on that land is keeping the thought in my mind...
Shadowheart,But don't worry - I still have plenty of room for you in both mind and heart.
Shadowheart,"Always good, when I'm with you - even in perilous lands such as these.<br>"
Shadowheart,"It's strange... I've been dwelling on what I told you before - about wanting to become a Dark Justiciar. But perhaps I should be content with my lot - I'm already blessed to have you at my side, after all.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Always good, when I'm with you.<br>"
Shadowheart,"I... I won't pretend that I don't know what you mean. Ever since we entered the Shadow Curse, I've felt like something's calling to me. Some purpose that I need to find."
Shadowheart,"Give me some time. If I can figure out whatever it is that I need to do, well... then there should be more time for us."
Shadowheart,Perhaps another time - Lady Shar is sated for now. But your eagerness to do more wickedness is noted.
Shadowheart,Who is to say? Perhaps she's keen to see me corrupt you.
Shadowheart,I can imagine she'd be delighted to turn a follower of Selûne towards the darkness.
Shadowheart,"Even if I could remember, I'm not sure I'd tell you. I don't want your ego to get over-inflated."
Shadowheart,Just like that...? I thought we had something special. Something lasting.
Shadowheart,Another battle. Just what I needed.
Shadowheart,Clearly I was mistaken. But at least it's a mistake I won't make twice.
Shadowheart,"You know what that offer truly entails, don't you? Become half a mind flayer. Lose half of yourself. I don't want that."
Shadowheart,... fine. I truly hope you're right about this.
Shadowheart,I gave you my answer. Now drop it.
Shadowheart,They're ravenous predators with fangs like daggers - it's hardly an irrational fear to harbour.
Shadowheart,"Better, now, I think. Now that I know the truth. Now that I have my family - and you.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Firstly, you may need to soften that githyanki way with words a little."
Shadowheart,"What can I say? I've fulfilled my destiny, become everything Lady Shar wished of me. And in no small part thanks to you."
Shadowheart,I know. And the feeling's mutual. I'll settle for gazing into those eyes for now.
Shadowheart,"After all, it can get awfully cold at night out here in this wilderness..."
Shadowheart,You're an outsider in every regard. Small talk with the natives won't help you fit in.
Shadowheart,Inquisitive. Looking for connection... it's every man for himself and you're looking to make friends.
Shadowheart,I'm almost flattered. Almost.
Shadowheart,"... but in truth, it'll become all about you as soon as you can twist it that way."
Shadowheart,I don't think I'm the salve you're looking for. Sorry about that.
Shadowheart,"Admirable, I suppose. Or desperate. I'm not quite sure."
Shadowheart,"Oh, I think you'll find that I am. Knowing what makes people tick is... a skill of mine."
Shadowheart,"Heh. You seem a little lost in your thoughts. I can leave you to them, unless there's something else?"
Shadowheart,"That's all you're entitled to, for now. Our parasite problem doesn't make you my confidante."
Shadowheart,Hmm. A refreshing dose of honesty. Careful people don't take advantage of that.
Shadowheart,"My, look at you: straight as an arrow, right to the point every time..."
Shadowheart,"...this isn't the tadpole I'm speaking to, is it? The personality seems a little lacking..."
Shadowheart,I jest. It's good to know you're not entirely without a sense of humour. Shall we?
Shadowheart,You're as discreet as you are pale. Admirable.
Shadowheart,Me? I'm not hiding anything. I'm merely sharing as much as you deserve to know.
Shadowheart,"And right now, you've reached your limit. Let's talk about something else."
Shadowheart,Oh don't worry. I'm learning about you with each passing moment.
Shadowheart,I haven't even dared to use the more benign forms of illithid powers - do you really think I'm eager to jump to the next step?
Shadowheart,I suppose you've earned it.
Shadowheart,I thought you'd never ask.
Shadowheart,Just the one?
Shadowheart,Well don't stand on ceremony - come here.
Shadowheart,"Whole - at last. Thank you, for being by my side through all of this. I never realised I could have a true family - or a true love."
Shadowheart,"Maybe you and I are not meant to be, I don't know. I sense I'll have little time for distractions, moving forward. Especially ones that don't bear fruit."
Shadowheart,"I'm trying to say that you've earned my trust in a way very few ever have... I want that to mean something. I want you to know more about me - at least, from what I can remember."
Shadowheart,"Even things that some might find silly - my favourite flower, my fear of swimming... yet you accepted me, all the same."
Shadowheart,Worth a rummage.
Shadowheart,Let's see what we have here.
Shadowheart,Mustn't be seen.
Shadowheart,No need to fight fair.
Shadowheart,"Come find me, if you dare..."
Shadowheart,Need to keep out of sight.
Shadowheart,"Not the bravest strategy, I'll admit."
Shadowheart,Unnoticed - good.
Shadowheart,Can't attack what can't be seen.
Shadowheart,"Better to hide than fight, sometimes."
Shadowheart,Might as well take a look.
Shadowheart,Hidden - for now.<br>
Shadowheart,Need to stay hidden.
Shadowheart,Better hide.
Shadowheart,Better go help that wretch.
Shadowheart,Typical. Suppose I'll help.
Shadowheart,"Ugh, better offer help.<br>"
Shadowheart,Better go help that wretch.<br>
Shadowheart,Useless. Get a grip.
Shadowheart,You're lucky I'm even helping.
Shadowheart,Suppose I'll lend a hand.<br>
Shadowheart,Ought to just leave you.
Shadowheart,Better avoid unfriendly eyes.
Shadowheart,Might find something useful.
Shadowheart,"Hmm, let's see...<br>"
Shadowheart,Should check for anything useful.
Shadowheart,This way.<br>
Shadowheart,Got to keep moving.<br>
Shadowheart,"Onward, then.<br>"
Shadowheart,Need to keep going.
Shadowheart,Let's try this way.
Shadowheart,No time to waste.<br>
Shadowheart,"Onward, in Shar's name."
Shadowheart,"Onward, in Her name."
Shadowheart,I must keep going.
Shadowheart,I love the sound of lockpicking.
Shadowheart,"Let's pop you open, shall we?"
Shadowheart,Let's see what my touch can do.
Shadowheart,Let's get this lock to yield.
Shadowheart,A lock? How tempting.
Shadowheart,Let's get this thing open.
Shadowheart,Time to open you up.
Shadowheart,I'll get this lock to yield.
Shadowheart,Let's pop this open.
Shadowheart,Now what are you hiding?
Shadowheart,"Shar, guide my hand."
Shadowheart,Let's get you open.
Shadowheart,Now what might you be hiding?
Shadowheart,I'd better take a peek.<br>
Shadowheart,Stuck? Really? Ridiculous.<br>
Shadowheart,Worse than a bloody child.<br>
Shadowheart,Useless. Come on.
Shadowheart,You're lucky I'm helping.
Shadowheart,'Death is the Blade's companion' - isn't that what they say? I think I preferred it as a metaphor.
Shadowheart,No harm in trying.
Shadowheart,Better give this a try.
Shadowheart,"I suppose it was too much to hope we were going to be cured here and now. To Moonrise, then."
Shadowheart,"What was that? I really can't abide mumbling, Wyll."
Shadowheart,Haven't you ever heard 'don't catch your chickens before they hatch'?
Shadowheart,"Or perhaps 'Don't count your adventurers before they survive a arduous, danger-filled journey'?"
Shadowheart,Better get to it.<br>
Shadowheart,Better give it a try.
Shadowheart,"A nice, leisurely voyage? The idea seems pleasant enough... but knowing our luck, we'd probably end up as easy targets the whole away."
Shadowheart,Huh. Let's see...
Shadowheart,That's one way to end a party. Let's mop up the goblin leftovers and get some rest.
Shadowheart,Talk about having your cake then killing it. I hope all your romantic liaisons don't end this way.
Shadowheart,"Come on, up you get.<br>"
Shadowheart,"It brings me closer to Lady Shar. One day, all of our eyes will feast on her endless darkness."
Shadowheart,No harm in a little mystery...
Shadowheart,"Besides, I think it suits my bone structure."
Shadowheart,"Here, let me help."
Shadowheart,"Come on, up you get.<br><br>"
Shadowheart,They'll crumble away in time... but no harm in appreciating their beauty until then.
Shadowheart,I'm not through with you yet.<br>
Shadowheart,Back on your feet.
Shadowheart,Help's on the way.<br>
Shadowheart,"Don't even joke about it. Bad enough that he's haunting our camp, with his cryptic asides and his... overall mustiness..."
Shadowheart,No time for dallying.<br>
Shadowheart,"Come on, no excuses."
Shadowheart,"So before you were Blade of the Frontiers, you were Pointy Stick of the Park? How did the imaginary monsters compare with the real thing?"
Shadowheart,Stuck? Of course.
Shadowheart,Let's see this done.
Shadowheart,Seems simple enough.
Shadowheart,"Right, better get to it."
Shadowheart,"On I go, then."
Shadowheart,No time like the present.
Shadowheart,Better get to work.<br>
Shadowheart,"Hmm, let's see.<br>"
Shadowheart,Can't leave you in a bind.
Shadowheart,It'll be all right.
Shadowheart,I'll fetch you.
Shadowheart,Of course I'll help.<br>
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, help's coming."
Shadowheart,I won't leave you behind.<br>
Shadowheart,"It's all right, I'm coming."
Shadowheart,This'll give me an edge.
Shadowheart,Might help.<br>
Shadowheart,Worth a try.
Shadowheart,Might make things interesting.<br>
Shadowheart,A waste of my skills.
Shadowheart,A waste of good healing.
Shadowheart,Hardly deserving of this.
Shadowheart,Pull yourself together.
Shadowheart,Hardly a scratch.
Shadowheart,Let's try this way.<br>
Shadowheart,"Onward, ever onward."
Shadowheart,I'll take this way.
Shadowheart,I'd like to think that would've happened anyway.
Shadowheart,I should think so.
Shadowheart,Let's head back. If we must.
Shadowheart,Good to know. For the future...
Shadowheart,"That didn't hurt, did it?"
Shadowheart,"But I can be patient, and I think you can too. Who knows what the future will bring our way?"
Shadowheart,"Karlach. You're very beautiful, you know. I might even kiss you if I valued my life a little less."
Shadowheart,You read my mind. But with your fire... our first kiss might be our last.
Shadowheart,Thank you for last night.
Shadowheart,But you're sweet to notice.
Shadowheart,Nearly light. The others will be awake soon...
Shadowheart,It helps me create all new memories.
Shadowheart,On the contrary.
Shadowheart,You're sweet.
Shadowheart,"Heh, I did! And you remembered. "
Shadowheart,"Perhaps, but please - enough about me. Sharing's bad for my complexion."
Shadowheart,A lot of the little things... they're lost to me right now.
Shadowheart,"When you worship Shar, secrecy is everything. We'll sacrifice our own memories when ordered to."
Shadowheart,Don't laugh... but I'm not quite sure I have anything to share.
Shadowheart,Sounds like you just need a little more liquid inspiration.
Shadowheart,Don't stop now. Not just as things are getting interesting...
Shadowheart,How morbid. Yet fascinating.
Shadowheart,Go on - I insist.
Shadowheart,I... We should head back.
Shadowheart,"Fishing for blackmail material, that's all."
Shadowheart,Oh... yes. I suppose we'll have to.
Shadowheart,Oh... of course.
Shadowheart,Does that mean you're spoken for or not? Heh.
Shadowheart,"Merciless, but beautiful in its own way... Sounds familiar."
Shadowheart,I can relate. I think I used to have a place of my own I liked to retreat to... but it slips my mind. 
Shadowheart,Well then. Head on back. I'm sure your cold bedroll is missing you terribly.
Shadowheart,There's still plenty of wine and the whole night ahead of us.
Shadowheart,Nothing worthwhile should be rushed anyway.
Shadowheart,I'm sure they'd last another while without us. But if you insist...
Shadowheart,"Oh, I see. Think I can't get you to confess? I'm something of an expert."
Shadowheart,Straight answers are overrated. Where's the discovery?
Shadowheart,"You don't waste time, do you?"
Shadowheart,Oh? And what else do you find to be fair?
Shadowheart,Good. A little mystery will keep you on your toes.
Shadowheart,Which is why I'm looking for a little company.
Shadowheart,"Where I come from, that's frowned upon."
Shadowheart,But please - enough about me. Sharing's bad for my complexion.
Shadowheart,It's not convenient - it's true.
Shadowheart,I suppose so. Celebration's over - time to pick up the trail again.
Shadowheart,"Another moment won't kill them, I suppose... Well, it might, but let's take that risk."
Shadowheart,Anyway. Thank you for tonight.
Shadowheart,Bashful come the light of day?
Shadowheart,"Oh, I'm perfectly fine, but the mood is well and truly dead."
Shadowheart,"Well deserved, though."
Shadowheart,It was just what I needed.
Shadowheart,We should head back.
Shadowheart,I'll lend a hand.<br>
Shadowheart,Now tell me something about yourself.
Shadowheart,Right. 'Friendship'.
Shadowheart,"You know, I'm starting to remember that Wyrm's Crossing has a bit of a reputation, doesn't it? A tad mercenary, a tad sordid. Anything and anyone for a price..."
Shadowheart,"You sound like you're speaking from experience, Wyll. Perhaps you'll have to give me a tour - refresh my memory."
Shadowheart,I'm sure this will be riveting.
Shadowheart,"Likely a waste of time, but I'll talk."
Shadowheart,I doubt there's much worth saying.
Shadowheart,The things I do... or speak to.
Shadowheart,Better get this over with.
Shadowheart,Hardly a conversation I'll relish.
Shadowheart,Not someone I'd rush to speak to.
Shadowheart,I'd better do the talking.<br>
Shadowheart,Better make myself known.
Shadowheart,No harm in a sly chat.
Shadowheart,Let's see what I can learn.
Shadowheart,I should grab that.<br>
Shadowheart,Might be useful.
Shadowheart,I'll grab that.<br>
Shadowheart,Worth grabbing.
Shadowheart,Worth taking.
Shadowheart,Better fetch that.<br>
Shadowheart,I shouldn't even bother.
Shadowheart,That's hardly a scratch.
Shadowheart,I'll go this way.
Shadowheart,Have to keep pushing.
Shadowheart,I wonder how I'll feel when I remember everything.
Shadowheart,"Very well, have it your way. To friendship."
Shadowheart,"You'd be surprised how people can miss what's in plain sight. I missed the fact that Shar was deceiving me. Besides, I have a new look now. Suits me, I think."
Shadowheart,"That's different. You'd be surprised how easily Lady Shar can hide in plain sight. People go around blinkered, caught up in their own lives."
Shadowheart,I suppose I'll find out. To us.
Shadowheart,Bold. What does 'us' entail?
Shadowheart,Here's to many more. Survival.
Shadowheart,Very practical. We could've toasted to that every night so far.
Shadowheart,...I like it. To victory.
Shadowheart,"Dominant, self-centred, savouring another's loss..."
Shadowheart,"Well, to begin, I think a toast is in order. Any suggestions?"
Shadowheart,So eager. I'm surprised it took you this long.
Shadowheart,You made it. Come here - sit with me.
Shadowheart,"You could strangle them by accident, use too much rope and break their legs... and if it goes really badly, you could wrench their heads right off."
Shadowheart,Prepare to die!
Shadowheart,Well this is going to be awkward.
Shadowheart,I saw you training those children. You were so gentle! That's... not how I was taught.
Shadowheart,"I wouldn't quite say that - I learned the lesson, after all."
Shadowheart,Not someone I'd rush to speak with.
Shadowheart,This is going to be a waste of air.
Shadowheart,"If I succeed, maybe I'll be allowed a pet... ugh, stop being silly."
Shadowheart,"Amazing how the city can seem almost peaceful at times, knowing all that goes on out there."
Shadowheart,"Consider the numbers. Someone out there must be having the worst day of their life. Being robbed, evicted, widowed, who knows? Then, easy prey for Lady Shar."
Shadowheart,"Consider the numbers. Someone out there must be having the worst day of their life. Robbed, evicted, widowed, who knows? No wonder Shar thrives, with such misery..."
Shadowheart,Have to keep focused. Can't afford to get attached - to anyone.
Shadowheart,Strange. I've had more freedom this past while than my whole life...
Shadowheart,"Umberlee - a brutal goddess, from what I understand. Without even the slightest touch of subtlety to her."
Shadowheart,Besides... it suits me.
Shadowheart,"It's... it's difficult to put into words, but I think I have the measure of you now. You've gone from stranger, to someone I'd be loath to journey without."
Shadowheart,"Ahem. I've shown no signs of lycanthropy, thank you very much... but should that change, I'll take it you're volunteering to be child-minder."
Shadowheart,She betrayed her sister and ruined the balance of things.
Shadowheart,So... I gather your affections have drifted elsewhere. Curious.
Shadowheart,"I heard you and Astarion. For a while I thought you were a little more subtle in your tastes, but I suppose not. Enjoy your pallid confection, I suppose."
Shadowheart,"Oh don't be like that - you've made your bed, now go roll around in it with your new beau."
Shadowheart,I suppose it was. And don't worry - I'm not going to toss your belongings into the campfire or anything.
Shadowheart,"Though for a while, I thought I might have someone to share new memories with. Not to be, it seems..."
Shadowheart,"Or who you feel, seemingly. But no harm done. We were merely... dabbling, I suppose."
Shadowheart,"You and Wyll, is it? I'm glad the blade has found a new sheath, at least."
Shadowheart,What drew you to Karlach? The muscles? The musk? I suppose we're all entitled to a bit of rough now and again...
Shadowheart,"And Lae'zel, no less. That's one way to keep an eye on her, I suppose."
Shadowheart,"You're entitled to find pleasure wherever you choose, but it would have been decent of you to talk to me before straying."
Shadowheart,May the darkness protect you.
Shadowheart,"So, you and Minthara, is it? I suppose that little spark we shared has been snuffed out then. I don't blame you though - she is a... compelling prospect."
Shadowheart,"And don't worry about me - I'll manage, one way or another. But I'll remember our little moments together fondly - they're amongst the few good memories I can lay claim to."
Shadowheart,"I think you may be overestimating his willingness to share - he may seem like the carefree hedonist, but there's something fragile beneath the facade."
Shadowheart,"If you can give him the solace that I'm convinced he desperately needs, then it would just be cruel for me to try and elbow in - liable to end in tears, or blood, or both."
Shadowheart,"There's no hard feelings - genuinely. You deserve happiness, and I'm more than glad to remain with you to bear witness to it."
Shadowheart,Don't be foolish - you're far too handsome to hate.
Shadowheart,Don't be foolish - you're far too pretty to hate.
Shadowheart,Don't be foolish - you're far too easy on the eyes to hate.
Shadowheart,The feeling is mutual. I mean it.
Shadowheart,Sometimes it can be difficult to know what you want - what you need - until it's already lost to you. I know that from experience.
Shadowheart,I won't lie. I won't pretend that part of me isn't hoping you'll look in my eyes and still feel something.
Shadowheart,I suppose I can't really blame you - Astarion has a knack for making people swoon even while the blood's still in their veins. I hope you two find your version of happiness together.
Shadowheart,Lady of Sorrows guide us. Did you want something?
Shadowheart,Shar's blessings upon you.
Shadowheart,"Gale was clearly interested. There's not many who could match his charm, when he sets his mind to it..."
Shadowheart,"Very well, don't have too much fun without me. I'll keep watch here in the meantime."
Shadowheart,Fine. I'll be here whenever you rediscover your taste in company.
Shadowheart,"As you like. You behave yourself out there, and come back to me in one piece."
Shadowheart,Very well. Take care of yourself out there. I'll be waiting for you.
Shadowheart,"I suppose a some idle time at camp might do me good - as long as I still see you, come nightfall. Take care."
Shadowheart,Well you know best. I'll be ready whenever you need me. Take care of yourself out there.
Shadowheart,I suppose a little 'me time' at camp wouldn't go amiss. Fetch me whenever you need me - and mind yourself out there.
Shadowheart,I'll see you at camp then. Be safe - I'm not sure how we'd manage without you.
Shadowheart,A shame. I thought we were doing well together... perhaps I'll see you at camp. Farewell.
Shadowheart,As you like. Perhaps I'll see you at camp.
Shadowheart,"I won't pretend I'm disappointed. Your company is... never mind. See you at camp, perhaps."
Shadowheart,I'm afraid you're stuck with me for now - I can't reach our camp from here.
Shadowheart,"Cast aside some of your present company, then we can talk."
Shadowheart,All right. Some company wouldn't hurt on the road - especially if there's trouble.
Shadowheart,"Ugh, I have to say I'm feeling rather worn out lately. Curious..."
Shadowheart,Ugh... feeling rather worn down today. Hard to rest in this wilderness...
Shadowheart,"We could have gotten up to all sorts of mischief the other night, you and I... had you not fled like a startled cat."
Shadowheart,About Lae'zel - she posed a threat to me. I hope you understand that. She forced my hand.
Shadowheart,Lae'zel. You look well. Clearly midnight skirmishing doesn't cost you any beauty sleep.
Shadowheart,"What is it? You'd better not be hungry again. Bare your fangs at me, and I'll knock them out."
Shadowheart,I can't help but notice you seem happier of late. There's a spring in your step that wasn't there before. Just a pity that I'm not responsible for it.
Shadowheart,I can tell it's serious. Whoever's won your heart... I won't stand in your way. I hope you make each other happy.
Shadowheart,I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that Lae'zel may not be keen to share you with me.
Shadowheart,"Foolish, I know. But allow me to wallow in the fantasy a moment, bittersweet as it is."
Shadowheart,But what about Lae'zel? Are you truly willing to risk her ire just to be with me?
Shadowheart,I won't lie... I feel a little sorry for her. But only a little bit.
Shadowheart,You may be what's been missing from my life.
Shadowheart,"True, we're acting out of desperation. Let's just be careful - any potential cure is useless if our heads are parted from our shoulders beforehand."
Shadowheart,All these tell-tale signs of Dark Justiciars that we've been seeing - I'm having a hard time believing they're a coincidence.
Shadowheart,"Still... there may be more to it. I need to keep alert, in case that suspicion amounts to anything."
Shadowheart,"Likely, yes. Our goddesses' quarrel began long before you or I were alive. I'll wager it'll continue long after we're both dead."
Shadowheart,"Don't be. He's charming enough, well-read and well-groomed. You could end up with worse specimens at your side."
Shadowheart,Gale has a proud streak - do you truly think he'd want to share? Try wooing you while I lurked in the corner waiting my turn? No. That's not him.
Shadowheart,I sincerely hope there's actually a cure to be found in this place. We're putting ourselves in unnecessary danger otherwise... 
Shadowheart,"I was sure you had eyes for Wyll alone. And I wouldn't blame you, either."
Shadowheart,"You know, I truly do marvel sometimes that I ever had feelings for you. What do you want?"
Shadowheart,Mmm-hmm? This had better be important.
Shadowheart,"Honestly, I should be grateful that you ended things between us - I dodged a poison-tipped arrow there. What do you want? "
Shadowheart,Spit it out then.
Shadowheart,I'm listening - though don't ask me why.
Shadowheart,I'll need to think on it for a while.
Shadowheart,Not right now. I need a moment.
Shadowheart,"I wasn't expecting it, but I'm glad to have some company on this journey."
Shadowheart,"All's well, I hope? Aside from the obvious?"
Shadowheart,"Almost pleasant, travelling with company. If you ignore all the... less pleasant aspects.<br>"
Shadowheart,"Indeed. We're overdue for a talk... and a little honesty, on my part."
Shadowheart,I can never take for granted how someone might react when they learn I worship Lady Shar - easier to just keep it a secret than take the risk. But you showed you had an open mind.
Shadowheart,"More than that, I even have an idol of the Nightsinger to call my own, thanks to you."
Shadowheart,"Twice over, in fact. You supported me against Lae'zel. I may not have survived that night without you."
Shadowheart,I already opened up to you before - shared some of the crumbs of memory that I can still lay claim to.
Shadowheart,I am not going to offer apologies for doing as I was commanded to.
Shadowheart,Take care - I'll be here when you need me.
Shadowheart,I've seen them at work before. I wasn't alone in my mission - all those who were sent with me were slain by githyanki blades.
Shadowheart,All will be revealed in due time. I hope.
Shadowheart,But what about Karlach? You'd break her heart just to be with me?
Shadowheart,"But what about Gale? Are you seriously suggesting you'd cut ties with him, to be with me...?"
Shadowheart,I won't lie... I feel a little sorry for him. But only a little bit.
Shadowheart,You'd truly end things with Wyll to be with me...?
Shadowheart,"But what about Astarion? Losing you could nudge him to a dark path. Are you truly willing to sacrifice what you have with him, for me...?"
Shadowheart,"Well, I'm flattered you care enough about me to have doubts... but we both know where your heart truly lies."
Shadowheart,Well that's one way to end things. 
Shadowheart,I hope this is important.<br>
Shadowheart,"You know, just because I join you at your bedroll from time to time doesn't mean you need to talk to me quite so much. Is this urgent?<br>"
Shadowheart,"Personality isn't everything, I suppose. Plenty of relationships can limp along on physical attraction alone. What do you want?"
Shadowheart,"I can't blame you. Who wouldn't want a hero of the classic mould for a lover - and heir to a noble house, to boot?"
Shadowheart,"In truth, I don't think I'd want to be your spare lover. I'd always want more of you than you'd have to spare. Better perhaps to bow out with dignity."
Shadowheart,"Ugh, I have to say I'm feeling rather worn out lately, Astarion. Curious..."
Shadowheart,Careful. I'd hate to spoil the moment by stabbing you.
Shadowheart,I can think of at least one place it could go.
Shadowheart,"Perhaps later,  when we're alone..."
Shadowheart,Are you trying to make me blush? I think it might just be working...
Shadowheart,I wished I shared your confidence.
Shadowheart,"They must want that artefact back badly, if they're dispatching red dragons in pursuit of it. But we cannot afford to lose it."
Shadowheart,I wish I'd never been sent on this mission. It had better be worth it.
Shadowheart,"You'll have to live with that curiosity for now, I'm afraid. Let's just concentrate on ridding ourselves of these tadpoles."
Shadowheart,Stay ignorant then. Just don't compromise me.
Shadowheart,True enough. 
Shadowheart,I've seen them at work before. I wasn't alone in my mission - all those who were sent with me were slain by your peoples' blades.
Shadowheart,"Of course, I'll see you in the evenings. Stay safe out there."
Shadowheart,"Very well. I do like it here, truth be told; my own little corner, time to think... but I'll be ready when you need me. Take care."
Shadowheart,Take care. I'll keep an eye on this place.
Shadowheart,Rubbish.
Shadowheart,"A Selûnite book. I'm almost surprised that lot can read, never mind write."
Shadowheart,"Selûnite. Strange, seeing  such an item in a new light."
Shadowheart,Selûne. Fit only for a rubbish pile.
Shadowheart,Moonwitch rubbish. Ought to be burned.
Shadowheart,"Selûnite. I would have looked on this with scorn, once..."
Shadowheart,"Strange. I would have scoffed at such a thing, once."
Shadowheart,I would have destroyed this in Shar's name once. But no longer.
Shadowheart,Hardly even worth selling.
Shadowheart,Was anything I was taught about Selûne true...?
Shadowheart,Hmmph. Selûnite detritus.
Shadowheart,Of the moonwitch. Ought to be burned.
Shadowheart,"Selûnite. Strange... once, I would have been repelled. Now, I don't know."
Shadowheart,"Selûnite. Once my enemy, now the enemy of my enemy..."
Shadowheart,Sometimes I still catch myself scoffing at anything Selûnite... old habits die hard.
Shadowheart,Selûnite. An offence to the eyes.
Shadowheart,I'm not afraid of wolves any more - spare me your cheap tricks!
Shadowheart,"Wolves...? No, anything but wolves..."
Shadowheart,Keep away from me!
Shadowheart,Not another one.
Shadowheart,No. Anything but a wolf...
Shadowheart,"Everyone's frightened of something. My fear's hardly irrational, when you see the fangs on those things."
Shadowheart,Blasted wolves. They always make me feel like that scared little girl all over again...
Shadowheart,"A Selûnite book. Perhaps I should actually heed her words, for a change."
Shadowheart,"She asked me my name. I can't remember what I said. I can't remember anything before those woods. All I know is she saved my life, and gave me a new home. With Lady Shar."
Shadowheart,"Curious, seeing a book of Selûne and not wanting to immediately rip it up..."
Shadowheart,Imagine wasting your time actually reading this tripe.
Shadowheart,Imagine turning on those who love you for you own glory...
Shadowheart,"Don't worry, I'll fix you up."
Shadowheart,"It's all right, I'll take care of you."
Shadowheart,'Fabian ran his calloused fingers along Allura's scales. Her tail quivered in response...'
Shadowheart,You fight well. Perhaps our survival isn't such a distant prospect.<br>
Shadowheart,"Do that again, and I'll kill you. That's your one and only warning - understand?"
Shadowheart,Good. Don't test me on this - I'm deadly serious.
Shadowheart,"Oh, let her stay. What's the worst that could happen?"
Shadowheart,You don't get to decide that. Keep your hands to yourself.
Shadowheart,You should have listened.
Shadowheart,You should've kept your hands to yourself.
Shadowheart,Strange... I would have been compelled to defile this shrine once. But no longer.
Shadowheart,"Dedicated to Selûne. A place where fools kneel, then."
Shadowheart,A waste of artisanship.
Shadowheart,Oh don't be such a killjoy. What's the worst that could happen?
Shadowheart,"She may not be much of an asset, but I doubt she'll be a hindrance. Let her stay."
Shadowheart,Safer to keep her here than blundering around by herself - wouldn't want her accidentally leading the wrong sort of attention to us.
Shadowheart,"Selûne... had life turned out differently, I might have been kneeling in prayer here."
Shadowheart,I don't know what I'm supposed to feel about Selûne now. I was fed lies for so long...
Shadowheart,It must take a truly feeble mind to raise such a dedication to Selûne.
Shadowheart,More moonwitch nonsense.
Shadowheart,"It would have been heresy to even consider reading this, once. No more."
Shadowheart,A Selûnite book. Fit only for the pyre.
Shadowheart,"Selûnite. I would have burned this, once. "
Shadowheart,I'll patch you up.
Shadowheart,Shadowheart...
Shadowheart,To serve. To repent.
Shadowheart,I want to talk to you about the other night. I thought we were having a pleasant time... but you cut it short.<br>
Shadowheart,Ah - so that's what people mean when they talk about butterflies in their stomach. Did you want something?<br>
Shadowheart,"You know, I've been catching myself smiling more lately. I think that's your fault.<br><br>"
Shadowheart,I was hoping you'd come to chat. What do you need?
Shadowheart,"Well, my day just improved. Did you want something?"
Shadowheart,Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.
Shadowheart,"Did you want something? If not, I'm perfectly happy to just gaze upon you a while."
Shadowheart,"Why hello, lover... that sounded more debonaire in my head, I'll admit. Do you need something?<br>"
Shadowheart,Good. I was just starting to miss the sound of your voice.
Shadowheart,I truly wouldn't have faulted you if you wanted Karlach. Those arms are built to sweep someone off their feet.
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar has given me a new mission - and the Prism plays no part in it. In fact, it seems like the Mother Superior's concern alone, and she has strayed from the Dark Lady."
Shadowheart,She will be in for a rude awakening when I finally stand before her again...
Shadowheart,But I digress. Did you want something?
Shadowheart,I do not serve Shar anymore. Nor the Mother Superior. The Prism is no longer my mission - saving my parents is.
Shadowheart,I do not serve Shar anymore. Nor the Mother Superior. The Prism is no longer my mission. Only the Nightsong can tell me what I must do next. 
Shadowheart,Something the matter?
Shadowheart,"The Chamber of Loss beckons. Lady Shar has one final task for me, then all of this will be mine."
Shadowheart,My parents are still captive. I need to free them.
Shadowheart,I suppose we didn't. Another life perhaps.
Shadowheart,"If you're sure... though you seem to know what you're doing, I suppose."
Shadowheart,If you're sure...
Shadowheart,"You mind yourself out there, understand? I'll be here when you need me."
Shadowheart,"All right. Be good out there - and if you can't be good, well... don't get caught. I'll be here whenever you need me."
Shadowheart,"I don't think there'll be any more trouble between Lae'zel and I, if you were wondering. We can all sleep easier now - well, apart from all the rest."
Shadowheart,Returned. Punished. My mission failed...
Shadowheart,"You know, we had the beginnings of something special once... but it was not meant to be, I suppose. Perhaps happiness lies elsewhere, for both of us."
Shadowheart,I don't answer to you - move along.
Shadowheart,No...
Shadowheart,To serve Lady Shar...
Shadowheart,I felt it. It didn't want to stay with me... I failed...
Shadowheart,Cleric...
Shadowheart,It is forbidden...
Shadowheart,A secret. My mission. Must keep it safe...
Shadowheart,Protect the artefact. Deliver to Baldur's Gate...
Shadowheart,Cannot. Must not. Too important...
Shadowheart,Baldur's Gate...
Shadowheart,On me. Always in reach...
Shadowheart,I... I defied Lady Shar. She won't stand for this... we can talk later - I need to get out of here first.
Shadowheart,I was convinced Lae'zel was had settled on you as her conquest. Brave of you to deny her.
Shadowheart,"You're a sight for sore eyes, even now. Did you want something?"
Shadowheart,What can I do for you?
Shadowheart,"You know, I didn't realise it was possible to be so cordial with a former flame. I suppose I'm lucky. Did you want something?"
Shadowheart,Careful - keep seeking me out like this and people may think we're rekindling things. Did you want something?
Shadowheart,Hmm. You wanted something?
Shadowheart,"In need of attention, I take it?"
Shadowheart,"Oh, you're back. <br><br>"
Shadowheart,Sometimes I wonder if I should just let the tadpole dictate my love life. Did you want something?
Shadowheart,I... I failed. I failed Lady Shar. She won't stand for this... we can talk later - I need to get out of here first.
Shadowheart,"That's one way to put it - careful she doesn't try to steal it to replace her own. But in all seriousness, I'm glad you found someone, even if it isn't me. I hope you make each other happy."
Shadowheart,I admire your ambition - and your belief in your own stamina - but Karlach deserves to have you to herself. And perhaps there's yet someone out there for me...
Shadowheart,"You know, we had the beginnings of something special once... but it was not meant to be, I suppose. For the best perhaps - I have to dedicate myself to Lady Shar now."
Shadowheart,"I must admit, you've been a surprise, and not an unpleasant one. Kindred spirits are few and far between for me."
Shadowheart,"Personally, I think finding this 'Halsin' is our best bet. "
Shadowheart,"You're not the kind of company I'd keep willingly, but all things considered... you'll do."
Shadowheart,We should make this a tradition - meet up every year.
Shadowheart,I'll admit it - I miss the sounds of the wilderness at night. You simply don't get that in the city.
Shadowheart,"Almost a shame we didn't throw more parties, come to think of it. After felling Ketheric Thorm perhaps? We even had an inn at our disposal. And a brewery..."
Shadowheart,My Lady truly shows her splendour on nights like these...
Shadowheart,"Oh no, this is far more sophisticated. It has layers."
Shadowheart,Ha! Not quite...
Shadowheart,I'm unappreciated in my time.
Shadowheart,"Come on, oink like a pig and boink - oh you know what I mean!"
Shadowheart,"Oh come on, you loved it. I'll wager I'll overhear you telling that to someone else before the night is out."
Shadowheart,"My, you'll make the others jealous if you spend much more time with me."
Shadowheart,Why thank you.
Shadowheart,Oh... what did the amorous boar say to the sow?
Shadowheart,Hmm... let me see...
Shadowheart,"Oh fine, if it gets you to crack a smile."
Shadowheart,"Not with that sort of attitude, I don't."
Shadowheart,"You might be on to something there... though the name might need work. Somehow it sounds rude, even though I know otherwise."
Shadowheart,I suppose it's worth a try - it might keep the animals amused for a while.
Shadowheart,"I've missed wine. Had to resort to making my own cider recently - which isn't bad, don't get me wrong - but a girl can't have fun with apples alone."
Shadowheart,"You're sweet, but don't worry. After all we've been through, this will be a breeze... just don't leave me alone for too long."
Shadowheart,"Oh, I've noticed. Ever since I first slipped into my camp garments, I should think."
Shadowheart,'Fancy a b-oink?'
Shadowheart,I hope the sand takes its time slipping through the hourglass - I don't want tonight to end too soon.
Shadowheart,"You know, I never really imagined Withers as much of a party-thrower, but then again I suppose our camps weren't taking care of themselves while we were out gallivanting, were they? There's hidden depths in that loveable husk."
Shadowheart,Indeed - healing can only do so much. We'd likely be dead somewhere out in the wilderness if not for him.
Shadowheart,"Even once all that is done, more will be asked of me, no doubt. The holy work will not be done until the Nightsinger's eternal darkness is restored."
Shadowheart,"There is one other matter. As the Chosen of Lady Shar, it is time to carry myself like one."
Shadowheart,"I still carry certain vestiges of a novice. That will no longer do. If I am to lead in Lady Shar's name, I must look the part."
Shadowheart,"Leave it to me - you'll see exactly what I mean, soon enough."
Shadowheart,Not just what I like - what Lady Shar demands of me.
Shadowheart,Don't worry. It's nothing that will bring you harm.
Shadowheart,I could get lost in those arms.
Shadowheart,Hard to imagine there was a time when I didn't have you to hold me.
Shadowheart,"You'll have me addicted to these embraces, do you know that?"
Shadowheart,"One hug is never enough, is it?"
Shadowheart,I hope there's more where that came from.
Shadowheart,"You could charge gold for hugs, you know. They'd be queuing over the horizon."
Shadowheart,"You've already pestered me with your notions once today. If I have something to add, I'll tell you."
Shadowheart,"This again? You're persistent, I'll give you that."
Shadowheart,"I'm not sure I'd agree, but very well. What do you want to know?"
Shadowheart,"What, Shar's tenets? If you like..."
Shadowheart,"Blessed Nightsinger, witness our adoration. See how we serve you, only you."
Shadowheart,"We have emptied our hearts of falsehoods. We have vanquished your foes. In the darkness, we see your truth."
Shadowheart,"Embrace us, your loyal warriors. Cloak us in your shadow. Guide us to your victory."
Shadowheart,Shar's will shall be done. As sure as night will fall.
Shadowheart,"Oh no, that's all part of the fun! You know me - I can't resist a bit of mystery."
Shadowheart,"Anyway, I know it's real. I know we made it. I just wish I could go back in time and reassure the old me that it would all work out. But enough introspection - this is a party."
Shadowheart,Save it for when we're alone.
Shadowheart,"They're our friends, dear. Let's spill nothing but wine tonight. "
Shadowheart,"Hmm, I hope that doesn't extend to me as well. But so long as your silver tongue is the only part of your mouth you put to use tonight."
Shadowheart,The owlbear?!
Shadowheart,"We'll have to find somewhere for him to sleep, of course - he'd get stuck in the door of the cottage. Maybe the barn? It's as warm as anywhere, as long as he gets along with the other animals..."
Shadowheart,I can picture the look on my parents' faces already...
Shadowheart,"Well now we're going to have to do that, aren't we? You're a bad influence, you know."
Shadowheart,"We'll have to find somewhere for him to sleep, of course - he'd get stuck in the door of the cottage. Maybe the barn? It's as warm as anywhere, as long as he gets along with Daphne."
Shadowheart,Of course he can come with us! I always regretted we didn't extend the offer after the battle - it was all such a blur...
Shadowheart,You didn't!
Shadowheart,Oh did you now? Come on then - out with it...
Shadowheart,"Perhaps I'll shoo the cats out of our room and scatter copper pieces over the bed some evening, and we can play make-believe."
Shadowheart,That sounds fun. Why haven't we been doing that?
Shadowheart,Just that. Off you go.
Shadowheart,Much better. Now off you go.
Shadowheart,Ahem.
Shadowheart,Have fun - just don't wear yourself out too quickly. I'm anticipating a long night ahead of us.
Shadowheart,Are you trying to make me sleepy? You know how easily I get lost in your arms.
Shadowheart,"Why, I feel better already. "
Shadowheart,"You'll seize any opportunity, won't you? But I suppose I've been giving your plenty of encouragement..."
Shadowheart,"But enough about Shar and her petty barbs - we're here to see old friends and enjoy ourselves, so let's do just that."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps. I won't get my hopes up just yet, but in truth, it doesn't matter. Her plan failed - I'm happy. I mean, how could I not be? I have you."
Shadowheart,She'd probably break out in hives.
Shadowheart,It's fine - already passed. Shar must have sensed I was enjoying myself.
Shadowheart,"So, we should divvy up what we tell people about what we've been doing these past few months - I'd hate to be a bore that comes along and regurgitates the same story to someone moments after you've told them. Any ideas?"
Shadowheart,Lady Shar's church in Baldur's Gate has yet to be cleansed. A rot has set in amongst the leadership - one that I must cut out.
Shadowheart,"All about you, of course. 'Hells or not, every day's an adventure when I'm at Karlach's side', I'll tell them. "
Shadowheart,"All about you, of course. 'Every day's an adventure when I'm at my love Gale's side', I'll tell them."
Shadowheart,Always a popular choice.
Shadowheart,"Naturally. There's not many positives I can acknowledge about the Hells, but it is good for anecdote fodder."
Shadowheart,Who knew smiling and waving could be so much work?
Shadowheart,"I suppose I can talk about playing the philanthropic duchess, touring the streets and winning the hearts of the masses."
Shadowheart,"Of course. You know, I think it was your self-confidence that made me fall for you to begin with - that, and that adorable earring of yours."
Shadowheart,"A touch bloodthirsty for party talk, no? But I suppose people like that sort of thing."
Shadowheart,"Heh, I was thinking the same of you. You pick me up whenever I'm down - often literally."
Shadowheart,You're right. Your mere presence alone will leave them awed - just like when I first clapped eyes on you.
Shadowheart,"Oh come here and pay the tax, silly."
Shadowheart,That's more like it.
Shadowheart,Forgetting something?
Shadowheart,"Don't get into trouble - but if you must, fetch me first."
Shadowheart,With music in the air and wine flowing? Oh I think I'll manage.
Shadowheart,Mmm. I could get lost in those arms.
Shadowheart,"Why, are you expecting to be gone for long? All right..."
Shadowheart,Almost a shame we're with company - I'd be tempted to let you whisk me away someplace quiet.
Shadowheart,That can be arranged...
Shadowheart,"I'm sure we'll have them hanging off our every word. I'll leave you to do some mingling, unless you need anything else?"
Shadowheart,"Well, there's the visit to the House of the Moon, fending off Sharran assassins, that stray imp that joined us - Bing Bong, wasn't it? We've squeezed a lot - and I'm glad I got to share it all with you."
Shadowheart,"All about you, of course. 'Every day is an adventure when I'm fighting at Lae'zel's side', I'll tell them."
Shadowheart,"All about you, of course. 'Every day - or night - is an adventure when I'm at my paramour Astarion's side', I'll tell them."
Shadowheart,"All about you, of course. 'Every day's an adventure when I'm at my beloved Wyll's side', I'll tell them."
Shadowheart,True. I wonder if anyone will be interested to hear the stories they told me of my youngest years. It's still strange to think of this whole other childhood I had before Shar. Almost like it's some other little girl...
Shadowheart,"She has - and I must continue to prove myself worthy of her favour. The apostate Ketheric Thorm still lives. That will soon change, if I have any say in the matter."
Shadowheart,"And her church in Baldur's Gate has been cleansed - Viconia strayed too far, and convinced herself that she knew better than the Nightsinger. The arrogance."
Shadowheart,A night orchid - remember I told you they were my favourite? I'm lucky to have found one - perhaps it's a good omen for us.
Shadowheart,"He's trouble - worse, he's a traitor. Whatever loyalty he had towards Lady Shar is long gone. It would please her greatly to see him meet his long-overdue end, I'll wager."
Shadowheart,I... I thought I was done for. I thought perhaps I might have been dead.
Shadowheart,"This... this is all like some sort of terrible dream. But it's real, isn't it? I stood before the Nightsong. I heard Lady Shar's words... and I failed her."
Shadowheart,Worse than failed her - I defied her. Just because of what that aasimar said.
Shadowheart,"I tried to leave... but Shar blocked me. Punished me for failing her. I thought I knew the limit of pain that the incurable wound could inflict, but I had no idea."
Shadowheart,"It felt like I was suffering the agony of a thousand people, all at once. My blood was boiling, my hair was on fire. I thought I'd claw my own face off with the pain..."
Shadowheart,"But then she released me - banished me more like. She said I was an outcast, that all of her children would know me and revile me. I'm alone."
Shadowheart,Thank you. I needed that. 
Shadowheart,"She may have offered me some protection from her shadows, but that doesn't extend to you. Easier for me to serve her if I still have you at my side."
Shadowheart,"I suppose I do, don't I? You've done more to help me than my faith has in recent times, if I'm honest. Thank you."
Shadowheart,I thought my faith was the most important thing in my life - I couldn't have been more wrong.
Shadowheart,I've squandered too much time already. I want to be with you. Now and always. Do you want the same?
Shadowheart,It wasn't too long ago that I could never imagine smiling again... shows what I know.
Shadowheart,Oh... then I'm sorry to have put you on the spot. Clearly I've a habit of seeking love in all the wrong places...
Shadowheart,"Live with it? For a time, at least. Anyone who bows to the Dark Lady could turn on me the moment they see me. I'm a target."
Shadowheart,Nightsong promised she'd tell me something about myself. I need to speak with her as soon as I can.
Shadowheart,"What she said to me back in the Shadowfell, about the wolves... that's no coincidence. "
Shadowheart,"She took flight to hunt down Ketheric Thorm. All I can do is help hasten his demise, and hope that answers soon follow."
Shadowheart,Heh. Thank you. You're a constant source of comfort.
Shadowheart,"There's been something between us for some time. A connection, more than friends... I recognised it, but didn't act on it."
Shadowheart,"That blessing you accepted - Lady Shar won't like it, but I have to hope she'll understand it was a necessary evil."
Shadowheart,Allowed? More like tolerated. But I thought it wiser to swallow my misgivings and keep focused.
Shadowheart,"Yet it was just a reminder of who I truly serve. I am still loyal to Lady Shar, and she will still offer me protection from some of her power."
Shadowheart,Huh. That was... actually rather comforting. Thank you.
Shadowheart,"When I shared the memory from my childhood, you found it far too easy to make a connection to Selûne for my liking."
Shadowheart,I've always felt like I owed Lady Shar my life... but what came before? Why was I in those woods?
Shadowheart,"Thinking about my wound... it can't just be random, how it torments me. Surely there's a pattern, a purpose..."
Shadowheart,The pain is something I can handle. Well... most of the time.
Shadowheart,True prayer needs peace. And serenity has proved elusive of late...
Shadowheart,"Normally, I'd tell you you're just reading too much into things. But, well..."
Shadowheart,"I've done it. I've actually done it. A Dark Justiciar, chosen by Lady Shar. It almost doesn't feel real..."
Shadowheart,The long-overdue death of Ketheric Thorm.
Shadowheart,"I must continue to prove myself worthy of her favour. The apostate Ketheric Thorm still lives. That will soon change, if I have any say in the matter."
Shadowheart,Not as glad as I am.
Shadowheart,"Well, it appears my days of seeking her approval are at an end."
Shadowheart,"Just my luck to enter a place where Lady Shar's power holds sway, only to find a Selûnite stronghold in its midst."
Shadowheart,"I suppose that cleric, Isobel, must seem impressive to you - wielding Selûnite magic, resisting Lady Shar's darkness..."
Shadowheart,"That cleric, Isobel - she seems almost impressive, in a perverse sort of way. I didn't think anyone could resist Lady Shar's power like she does."
Shadowheart,"And please - the less said about her blessing, the better. That was for your benefit, and to keep the peace."
Shadowheart,I do. 
Shadowheart,"You think so? Thank you. I felt meek, like I'd failed the Dark Lady... but it's important to choose the right time to fight her battles."
Shadowheart,"Selûnite presence here is an affront to Lady Shar, but this is not the time to do anything about it. We have bigger concerns."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps they might have done, if I was a lesser servant of the Nightsinger - one given to rash action."
Shadowheart,Pleased? Hardly. I felt the bite of the wound right after the moon witch's influence was forced upon me.
Shadowheart,You're lucky to have such confidence. Me... I think the full price of what I've done has yet to reveal itself. I'm a target to Lady Shar's followers now.
Shadowheart,"When Nightsong mentioned wolves, I felt my heart freeze. She knows things about me. She has the answer, and I don't even know the question yet."
Shadowheart,"Besides, you saved my life aboard the nautiloid. How can I do anything but sing your praises?"
Shadowheart,"Until I hear what Nightsong has to say for herself, I simply won't know if I've ruined everything for no reason."
Shadowheart,"Don't be concerned. Perhaps she'll present you with an opportunity to prove yourself. If I can find myself in her graces, you must have at least an equal chance."
Shadowheart,"The darkness is the truth, Selûnite. In the end, there will only be endless black, and those that Lady Shar has embraced."
Shadowheart,Cling to your torches and memories of the sun if you like - see how long you last without me.
Shadowheart,"This is no cavern - this is true darkness. Perhaps Lady Shar will show you a path to her embrace, if you are worthy."
Shadowheart,"I suspected that might have been the case, but there was no harm in being cautious. And besides, now you know"
Shadowheart,"Yes, you probably should have. Perhaps your moonwitch's guidance isn't as revealing as you believe it to be."
Shadowheart,"Why? Safety, discretion, to keep us focused... need I go on?"
Shadowheart,"In any case, we can talk about it later. It's the protection I have that matters right now."
Shadowheart,"I worship Shar, the Dark Lady, Mistress of the Night. Though honestly I'm surprised you didn't figure it out by yourself already..."
Shadowheart,And this means I must have her blessing. Lady Shar is protecting me where others are left to face her wrath.
Shadowheart,"I wanted to talk to you about that. Lady Shar has bestowed a great honour upon me... but it isn't without a cost, it seems."
Shadowheart,"I... I don't want to, but Lady Shar demands it. Everything is surrendered to her, ultimately. But she claims some things earlier than others, it seems."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps we'll still be able to find a way. Some interpretation of her will that let's us stay together. But I can't guarantee anything, and I suspect that she'll demand more and more of me, as time passes."
Shadowheart,"If you don't want to gamble on that, I understand. You'll have little trouble finding a more straightforward lover, I suspect."
Shadowheart,Are you sure? I don't want you to resent my divided affections...
Shadowheart,You mean a lot to me - it would be cruel to mislead you. Now what is it to be...?
Shadowheart,Then I can only hope Lady Shar will prove lenient if I try to keep a little piece of my heart from her...
Shadowheart,"As will I. Lady Shar may have honoured me, but I think it was you who changed me."
Shadowheart,If you're truly sure. I'm not even certain myself...
Shadowheart,"No, I can remain with you as an ally if nothing else, but beyond that, I'm not sure how much I can promise you."
Shadowheart,Indeed. And already I have seen to some of her holy work - the apostate Ketheric Thorm is dead. He stole Lady Shar's powers to extend his profane life. No more.
Shadowheart,I... I don't know. I'm sorry. It's not for me to guess what value Lady Shar places on each servant.
Shadowheart,"There will be more for me to do, no doubt. The holy work will not be done until the Nightsinger's eternal darkness is restored."
Shadowheart,"The Shadowfell, her domain, has power here. Whatever the Dark Lady needs of me, I'll wager the answer lies wherever her power is strongest. I need to find that place, and see what awaits me."
Shadowheart,"Have you ever heard of the Dark Justiciars? They were Lady Shar's most elite warriors. I can't explain why, but something about this reminds me of them."
Shadowheart,Be honest... what do you think of the new look?
Shadowheart,"I thought I knew who I was... but I was wrong. I do not belong to Shar, and I do not want to be adorned like one of her puppets any longer. "
Shadowheart,"You came to mind as well. I remembered that night, when you resisted your impulses, turned away from what was demanded of you."
Shadowheart,"I thought perhaps that if you could take a step towards the light, then I could try as well."
Shadowheart,"You came to mind as well. You turned from your queen, and found new purpose. I thought perhaps I might be able to do the same."
Shadowheart,"The hair is just a gesture, true, but everything has a first step."
Shadowheart,An unexpected benefit of my training. Any novice knows how to source the right herbs and mixtures to alter one's hair
Shadowheart,"Typically reserved for disguises and subterfuge rather than self-discovery, but I don't live by Shar's rules any longer."
Shadowheart,I'm glad... though I don't think I'm quite done with the past yet. Not until I've been to Baldur's Gate.
Shadowheart,"Well, I'm glad someone does. Perhaps I'll get used to it. I have a lot to get used to, right now."
Shadowheart,"Honest of you - I can appreciate that, after being lied to by Shar for so long."
Shadowheart,Give it time. It may grow on you.
Shadowheart,Don't get your hopes up. I'm not exactly keen to throw my lot in with another goddess after what happened last time.
Shadowheart,"I... I think so, yes. Perhaps I shouldn't put it to the test, but compared to everyone else, I feel fine. Better than fine."
Shadowheart,Do you know what this means? I must be blessed. Lady Shar is protecting me where others are left to face her wrath.
Shadowheart,She loves me. She must do.
Shadowheart,You're resourceful - you'll find a way. Don't give me that look. It's a good thing that I'm resistant to the shadows - this way I can help you.
Shadowheart,Carried away? Hardly - the proof is right there. Just be grateful someone can handle this place.
Shadowheart,Lady Shar wouldn't bless me like this for no reason - there must be something she wants of me.
Shadowheart,"Those signs we found, about Dark Justiciars... perhaps they were no coincidence. In either case, I need to watch for any place dedicated to Lady Shar. A temple, perhaps."
Shadowheart,This isn't the first sign we've come across of a Sharran presence. I'm not sure I can keep ignoring them.
Shadowheart,"I need to watch for any place dedicated to Lady Shar. A temple, perhaps. I need to know if there's more to this."
Shadowheart,"Very reassuring, thank you."
Shadowheart,"Oh it's no hardship; he loves them - him and mother both. But we'll fetch him something, yes - some of his shirts are looking a little worn..."
Shadowheart,"Oh, she's just protective of me - I give her a shoulder to perch on and all the nuts she can manage."
Shadowheart,"I wish I could see more of my parents, but we get by, and they're doing well for themselves. Perhaps one day both Wyll and I will be able to return for good."
Shadowheart,"... sorry, am I oversharing? I don't get much practice at polite conversation in that place, as I'm sure you can imagine."
Shadowheart,At Wyll's side in Avernus of course - be it in the heat of battle or the heat of the bedroll... 
Shadowheart,"It's not exactly the quiet life, but perhaps after all that happened, it's for the best if I keep busy. Still though, I hope Karlach and I can return for good some day."
Shadowheart,But enough about me - what have you been doing?
Shadowheart,"Between you and me, I've pretended to have a sprained ankle now and again, for a ride on those muscles."
Shadowheart,"But until then, I'm glad to be by her side - or thrown over her shoulder on occasion, if the odds turn against us."
Shadowheart,"It's not exactly the quiet life, but perhaps after all that happened with my parents, it's for the best if I keep busy. Still though, I hope Karlach and I can return for good some day."
Shadowheart,"I wish I could see more of my parents, but we get by, and they're doing well for themselves. Perhaps one day both Karlach and I will be able to return for good."
Shadowheart,"Until then, I'm right where I'm supposed to be - with the man I love."
Shadowheart,"Raising hells with Karlach in Avernus, of course. I'm surprised you can't smell the brimstone on me."
Shadowheart,"It's a privilege to have memories - even bad ones. They've moulded me into the person I am. As have you, come to think about it."
Shadowheart,"I like to think so. Choosing my own path is still something of a novelty for me, but at least I'm free to make my own mistakes."
Shadowheart,He seems to be doing well. In his element.
Shadowheart,"We had tea on his balcony - Tara even deigned to sit on my lap for a while. You know, I think entire forests must have been felled to quench that man's thirst for books."
Shadowheart,"Not quite. But luckily Selûne allows you to forge your own path. Perhaps I'll be drawn to her, perhaps not. Either way, I get to decide. That's not something I was ever able to claim before."
Shadowheart,And oh-so modest.
Shadowheart,But enough about me - what have you been up to?
Shadowheart,"I'd like to see the islands maybe, or head south to Amn. I heard there's an enclave of werecats that hunt the followers of dark gods by moonlight. I'd love to see if there's any truth to that."
Shadowheart,"I don't know - which is just the way I like it just now. Perhaps I'll just stick a pin in a map and see what I find, or head to the docks in the morning and scrounge a berth to somewhere new."
Shadowheart,"I can't imagine what would have come of me, had we not crossed paths. Now I'm free to find myself."
Shadowheart,"It's not exactly the quiet life, but perhaps after all that happened with my parents, it's for the best if I keep busy. Still though, I hope Wyll and I can return for good some day."
Shadowheart,"At Wyll's side, of course. Honestly, I'm still not used to being married - it's almost a surprise, every morning that I wake next to him. But a very pleasant surprise."
Shadowheart,"And I get to see my parents almost every day - I need to make every moment with them count, after so much was stolen from us. But they're doing well, and are very pleased to have a son-in-law."
Shadowheart,We're of a like mind then. Perhaps we should see about adventuring together at some point - for old time's sake.
Shadowheart,"She sowed the seeds of her own destruction when she betrayed you, Lae'zel. Just be careful. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you out there."
Shadowheart,"Playing it coy, are we? Sounds like a girl I used to know... but you're entitled to your secrets - at least until the festivities loosen your tongue a bit."
Shadowheart,"Do you ever rest? Think of all those poor budding adventurers looking to make a name for themselves - take some time off and give them a chance, why don't you?"
Shadowheart,"As am I - it's well-deserved, and I dare anyone to argue otherwise."
Shadowheart,Why there's probably someone making offerings and burning incense at the foot of your statue right now.
Shadowheart,Just don't forget us shrimpy wee mortals while you're exploring the extent of your new power.
Shadowheart,"That wouldn't have been your style even when you were just a man, would it?"
Shadowheart,I'm joking. Of course I want to know - tell me all.
Shadowheart,Must I...? You presume a great deal.
Shadowheart,"That, or very heavy drapes. But Astarion's fussy about his decor, so the cover of darkness is often the easiest option."
Shadowheart,"I've been at Astarion's side. You'll have to forgive me if you catch me yawning - given his aversion to the sun, we've had to keep unsocial hours in order to make the best of each other's company."
Shadowheart,Probably for the best that my parents aren't around to see me now - I'm not quite sure they'd approve of my choice of lover...
Shadowheart,"My parents are close enough that I get to see them regularly - a little cottage, outside the city. I need to make every moment with them count, after so much was stolen from us. "
Shadowheart,I've been at Astarion's side. You'll have to forgive me if you catch me yawning - this is the latest in a very long line of parties. He takes 'no rest for the wicked' very seriously.
Shadowheart,"I wonder what my parents would make of it, if they could see me. I'd like to think they'd be glad I was happy."
Shadowheart,"I wish I could see more of my parents, but we manage to stay in touch. They're well, settled at a cottage I found for them. Perhaps one day Lae'zel will have her fill of battle, and we can go join them for good."
Shadowheart,I'm not quite used to riding on a dragon with Lae'zel yet - I tend to cling to her waist for dear life. She makes the beast do barrel rolls every now and again to make me squeal.
Shadowheart,"Fighting at Lae'zel's side. Vlaakith is clinging to power, but the tide is turning in our favour, battle by battle."
Shadowheart,"I only wish my parents could have met him properly... but I think they know I'm happy. I can feel their presence, when the moon is full."
Shadowheart,Who knows? Perhaps they'll have grandchildren before long.
Shadowheart,Don't worry. I know their tired old tricks better than anyone - they'll need more than a hooded cloak and poisoned blade to best me.
Shadowheart,You saved the world - that doesn't leave much off the table. But point taken - I'll be as cautious as a cat with eight lives spent.
Shadowheart,"I have hopes that perhaps she might turn from Shar entirely, given time, but that's a decision she will have to make for herself. If that day comes, I'll be ready."
Shadowheart,"None other. The matter of her faith and allegiances remains... complicated, let's say, but she is still my oldest friend."
Shadowheart,"Some things can't be taken from you, it seems."
Shadowheart,"My mother's mind still drifts every now and again, but she has more good days than not-so-good days. She taught me her recipe for apple and plum pie, and when I tasted it, I actually remembered it, from when I was a little girl."
Shadowheart,"Healing. Learning to live again. It's hard to think of all that was robbed from them, but they're intent on making every day count for double."
Shadowheart,"I feel the same, honestly. The woman in the mirror looks unfamiliar sometimes - but she looks happy. And she has plenty of company as well."
Shadowheart,"You can come as soon as you please, so long as the lodgers approve of you."
Shadowheart,"Sedate is exactly what I've needed. It's harder than I'd expected, actually. I'll never take vegetables for granted after all the effort it's taken to grow a few, but still... it's mine. Well, mine and the lodgers."
Shadowheart,"Oh, like a barn. I bathed three times before tonight just to be safe, and cleared out the apothecaries of rosewater and incense."
Shadowheart,"I've called him Buttons, because he has different-coloured eyes, like buttons on a rag doll."
Shadowheart,"He's just a frightened little pup - he has no idea what he'll grow up to be. And maybe with me there to guide him... who knows what he'll become? It's amazing what can happen, with the right nurturing."
Shadowheart,"Just don't tell Halsin that, or he'll want an invitation."
Shadowheart,"I've had to do far worse things with my hands, trust me. This is no burden at all. I don't think I've ever slept more soundly than I have with my menagerie of beasts for company."
Shadowheart,"Four dogs, eight cats, nine chickens, six pigeons, four sheep, a milk cow named Daphne, a squirrel who's far too clever for her own good, and a wolf cub I found orphaned in some woods."
Shadowheart,"It's harder work than I'd expected, actually. I'll never take vegetables for granted after all the effort it's taken to grow a few, but still... it's mine. Well, mine and the lodgers."
Shadowheart,"I found a little cottage; abandoned, half-ruined - there's a lot of such places to be found, thanks to the Absolute's armies. I've been making it my own."
Shadowheart,Oh don't be such a grumpy rothé - being sentimental is what parties are for. Give it some time - you'll loosen up as the night progresses.
Shadowheart,"I had no doubt, but I'm glad to hear you say it, all the same."
Shadowheart,I'm glad you seem well. Truly.
Shadowheart,"Fair point. I'm not quite sure this evening's refreshments will be to your tastes, but hopefully the company will make up for it."
Shadowheart,"No offence intended - quite the contrary, in fact."
Shadowheart,"I suppose I do, don't I?"
Shadowheart,"Filled-out and healthy, is what I was going for. Don't tell me you miss living off whatever scraps we found in crates and barrels."
Shadowheart,"Father's making himself useful; helping me fix up the cottage, and caring for the animals. His wolf form is very useful in helping Buttons to acclimatise; I think part of him wishes I'd ended up a lycanthrope as well."
Shadowheart,I had a feeling you might. 
Shadowheart,"Sorry, I'm rambling. Family life and pastry recipes probably aren't the most interesting topics for such a historic reunion."
Shadowheart,I couldn't have said it better myself. Just be sure to take your own advice whenever you can? You've earned it.
Shadowheart,Don't worry. I know their tired old tricks better than anyone - they'll need more than a hooded cloak and poisoned blade to best me. Especially when I have a friend on the inside keeping me abreast of their predictable little plans.
Shadowheart,"Well, I've had run-ins with my former fellow Sharrans on a couple of occasions. Word seems to have spread of what happened at the Cloister - now other chapters of Shar worshippers see me as a prime target to offer up to their lady as a sacrifice."
Shadowheart,"Oh, I know they are. I can still sense them, I think. And one day, we'll be reunited."
Shadowheart,"Hard to imagine, isn't it? Me, of all people, in the lair of the 'Moon Witch' herself. Gods, your truest act of heroism was putting up with all that Sharran drivel I was spouting for so long."
Shadowheart,"It seemed like the perfect spot to reflect on my parents, on where they came from - and where I came from too, I suppose."
Shadowheart,"One of my first stops was the House of the Moon, in Waterdeep. It's the largest temple of Selûne in existence.<br>"
Shadowheart,Peace and quiet will still be there waiting once I've lived a little. Though don't get me wrong - I've got a little cottage with a garden and animals in mind already.
Shadowheart,"Wandering, mostly. The adventuring life is almost a tonic when you're not constantly threatened by brain monsters and cultists. I can finally see the world beyond the Cloister."
Shadowheart,"Sorry. I've found that happiness is an active thing. You have to fight for it every day, like you would a battle. I won't give her the satisfaction ever again."
Shadowheart,"The pain still comes from time to time, but I won't let her torment me. I won't let her take any more from me. She's had more than enough already - now she can dwell in her beloved darkness, ignored."
Shadowheart,"Father's making himself useful; helping me fix up the cottage, and caring for the animals - you should see the amount I have now. He's been waiting years for this; now he can't stop smiling."
Shadowheart,I do
Shadowheart,"Some strange githyanki adage, I assume? I'm not sure I want to know..."
Shadowheart,"Mad as a sack of shaken geese, clearly. No wonder they got rid of her."
Shadowheart,"... I may be a hater and a gatekeeper, but I'm also god's favourite princess, and the most interesting girl in the world."
Shadowheart,And proud of it.
Shadowheart,"Another time perhaps. Some undefined time in the far, distant future."
Shadowheart,Congratulations - I think I've sprained my tongue.
Shadowheart,"Ugh, fine... with a little bit of spittle, chew your vittles, then play skittles"
Shadowheart,"Ugh, the latrine's overflowing again - watch your step... oh I truly hope you're not speaking from experience."
Shadowheart,Of course I do - everything sounds good when I say it.
Shadowheart,"As am I - and no small bit surprised, also. Part of me's afraid I'll wake from the dream and find myself back in the wilds, or worse, at the cloister. But no... it's real."
Shadowheart,"So am I, at times. But he's just a helpless pup. I don't think it was a coincidence when I found him out in the woods. Far from it."
Shadowheart,"Ahem, if we journey together, it would be as equals. I think we've both been through enough to have earned each other's respect by now."
Shadowheart,"Hopefully these meet-ups will become a regular occurrence. It's not that I miss the tadpoles, but at least it brought us together. Now we've got to make the extra effort ourselves."
Shadowheart,I'm sorry. That can't be easy for you.
Shadowheart,"I'm glad to hear. You deserve it, after all you've done."
Shadowheart,Is that so?
Shadowheart,CONTINGENCY NODE - DO NOT RECORD
Shadowheart,"I thought perhaps you mightn't want to be reminded of the past, even if it was to see old friends. But I'm glad to be proven wrong."
Shadowheart,"Well there's no need for that tonight - you're among friends, and woe to anyone foolish enough to interfere with our reunion."
Shadowheart,I can imagine. Hopefully our humble little gathering is up to your measure.
Shadowheart,Good - let's just hope the only things that need skewering tonight are the party victuals.
Shadowheart,I'm glad you're willing to wield your power in aid of a good cause then - and what better cause is there than a party?
Shadowheart,Hells... I'm not sure I like the sound of that.
Shadowheart,At least the only quarry you're in pursuit of this time is a filled goblet.
Shadowheart,"Well I'm glad you joined us, all the same. It must be hard to pull yourself away from your balcony, with Tara curled up in your lap."
Shadowheart,"If I didn't know any better, I'd almost think you've missed me."
Shadowheart,I see... well I hope you managed to clean up before joining us.
Shadowheart,So have I. It hasn't been quite the same without you... I miss how you'd start dancing rather than stand still.
Shadowheart,"But no matter; if Withers' wily ways are what it takes to have you here with us, then I'm all for it."
Shadowheart,"He's quite powerful for a fellow content to loiter in our camp the whole time, isn't he? I wonder if he'll ever reveal what he's been up to, exactly..."
Shadowheart,"Well considering all he went through, I'll understand if his sense of humour lay dormant for a while. But I'm glad it's back."
Shadowheart,Exactly! That's what makes it so good.
Shadowheart,"Go on, you've got mingling to do. I'll work on my punchlines some more."
Shadowheart,"That's what bookmarks are for, Gale. You're allowed to come up for air every now and again."
Shadowheart,Hmm. We'll see.
Shadowheart,It's good to see everyone.
Shadowheart,"Fine, be like that."
Shadowheart,"And plenty of room for more, when they find their way to us."
Shadowheart,"What's the current count again...? Four dogs, eight cats, nine chickens, six pigeons, four sheep, Daphne the milk cow, that odd little squirrel that keeps jumping on my shoulder, and Buttons, of course."
Shadowheart,Let them crave whatever they want then - I'll know I got the better end of the bargain.
Shadowheart,"Oh gods no, that sounds awful. They'd drag mud everywhere and eat us out of house and home."
Shadowheart,"Oh stop it, you. We'll be back before you know it. Tonight, let's just enjoy ourselves, and catch up with old friends."
Shadowheart,True. They might even be jealous of the bucolic life. Perhaps every adventurer secretly pines for a little flower strewn cottage overrun with animals...
Shadowheart,"You look good, with your sleeves rolled up, working in the garden. I had to remind myself I was there to transplant the red cabbages and not just enjoy the view."
Shadowheart,"Me neither. It's just like I dreamed of - a little house to call our own, teeming with animals, the flowers we sowed starting to bloom... and you there, at my side."
Shadowheart,"I hope we won't seem terribly boring to everyone, when they ask what we've been doing this past while. A cottage in the countryside? They may have been expecting something more... well, more."
Shadowheart,A little wine might help accelerate the process...
Shadowheart,"I feel like I must have dreamed the last few months, and now I'm waking up back in camp with my hair smelling like woodsmoke and fallen leaves stuck to my backside."
Shadowheart,"I didn't expect to be nervous, but seeing everyone here like this... it's strange, isn't it? "
Shadowheart,Checking in on me? Sweet of you.
Shadowheart,"Can't keep away from me, I see? I don't blame you."
Shadowheart,"Withers has surpassed himself with the musical accompaniment for the evening - I had feared things might be a touch more sedate, out here in the wilderness."
Shadowheart,Let's make tonight count - the only regrets I want to hear about come morning should revolve around an excess of carousing and questionable dancing.
Shadowheart,There's special potions that can help with that - I think I saw some on a table over yonder if you care to investigate. 
Shadowheart,"Oh hush. We'll have each other all to ourselves again, soon enough."
Shadowheart,"I know... I'll have to stop myself from getting teary-eyed, when it's time to say goodbye again."
Shadowheart,"Enjoying yourself, I hope?"
Shadowheart,There's hidden depths in that loveable husk.
Shadowheart,"I know, I would've been an open book to you in no time. But don't pretend like you didn't like the mystery."
Shadowheart,As if you'd have me any other way.
Shadowheart,Oh be honest - I'm sure I saw you crack a faint smile... or perhaps it was just a twitch of the eye.
Shadowheart,"Sorry. My father's got years of terrible jokes stocked up that he never got to tell me when I was younger, but lucky for him, I never heard them... and seemingly I am easily amused."
Shadowheart,You're more than capable of forging your own path. I'm certain of it.
Shadowheart,"Oh, I don't know - I manage, in my own way. Selûne offers her wisdom of course, but she has a far lighter touch than Shar ever did."
Shadowheart,And we'll still have tonight. That's got to count for something.
Shadowheart,"Death, exile, or ceremorphosis. I'm sorry, Karlach. I wished there'd been better options open to you... but who knows? Perhaps they'll reveal themselves in time."
Shadowheart,"Of course I'm not surprised, Astarion. I'd be outright disappointed if you did anything less."
Shadowheart,"Really? I thought you might take up knitting, or jam-making perhaps."
Shadowheart,"That must be difficult, I'm sorry. But who knows what the future holds? Even Cazador might be toppled one night, given the right push."
Shadowheart,"I suppose the world is your buffet now - just be careful not to overindulge on innocent young necks, or you may find a mob after you."
Shadowheart,"I'm glad you two have each other - Hells, I'd be almost tempted to come along if you'd have me... perhaps if your adventures ever lead you out of Avernus permanently. "
Shadowheart,I pity any fiend that decides to take you on. Your reputation in Avernus will soon match that in Faerûn.
Shadowheart,"You doing your best is already far more than most. I expect a new generation will grow up listening to tales of the Blade - Hells, give it a few more months and there'll probably be a host of newborns called Wyll."
Shadowheart,"There are few I'd trust to wield such powers more than you. I expect a new generation will grow up listening to tales of the Blade - Hells, give it a few more months and there'll probably be a host of newborns called Wyll."
Shadowheart,"You have a good heart and a sharp mind, Wyll. Trust your own instincts, and the city will be lucky to have you."
Shadowheart,"Well you understand the gravity of the role, which means you're the right person for it."
Shadowheart,I should gift you some ear-plugs the next time I see you then. But I know you'll be able to keep Mizora in her place.
Shadowheart,"Just joking. I'm sure after all we've been through, you know your limitations better than anyone."
Shadowheart,"Mmm-hmm, isn't that how it always starts? "
Shadowheart,"Glad to hear it. After all we've been through, I think you deserve some time where the greatest peril you'll face is a papercut."
Shadowheart,"That's the beauty of it - we're in no hurry. We can do what we like now. Besides, you'll need someone to patch you up from time to time."
Shadowheart,"After all, we've faced down bigger threats than wrangling together a few social calendars."
Shadowheart,"I'm sure we will, but let's be proactive about it, all the same. We're more than capable."
Shadowheart,I can imagine - a celebrity in their midst? They must have raised their voices from whispers to faint murmurs.
Shadowheart,Think it over. We can talk more in the morning; pore over some maps perhaps.
Shadowheart,"Well you needn't count me amongst the panicky - I know what you did for all of us, and I'll never forget it."
Shadowheart,That sounds... foreboding. I'm not entirely sure I want to know more.
Shadowheart,They don't - they just wing it.
Shadowheart,"Oh, before you go. How does a red dragon plan their day?"
Shadowheart,Don't be a stranger.
Shadowheart,Careful - I might not let go one of these times.
Shadowheart,Never gets old.
Shadowheart,Come here...
Shadowheart,"Oh twist my arm and break it, why don't you..."
Shadowheart,Well seeing as you asked so politely...
Shadowheart,"Is that so...? And what liberties did you decide to take, exactly?"
Shadowheart,"All right then, it's settled. Oh, the things we'll get up to..."
Shadowheart,Are you sure he'd want to join? I'm not exactly settled anywhere right now. It could be dangerous at times.
Shadowheart,"I'll have to find somewhere for him to sleep, of course - he'd get stuck in the door of my cottage. Maybe the barn? It's as warm as anywhere, as long as he gets along with the other animals."
Shadowheart,"Well now I'm going to have to do that, aren't I? You're a bad influence, you know."
Shadowheart,I can picture the look on my parent's faces already...
Shadowheart,Well that's... half-reassuring. Good thing we've plenty of wild game around.
Shadowheart,I suppose you're right - he's come a long way since he first wandered into our camp. We all have.
Shadowheart,"I'll have to find somewhere for him to sleep, of course - he'd get stuck in the door of my cottage. Maybe the barn? It's as warm as anywhere, as long as he gets along with Daphne."
Shadowheart,"Of course I'll have him - if he wants to come with me, that is. I'd have offered sooner, but everything was a blur after the battle - I thought he'd gone to roam free..."
Shadowheart,The owlbear...?
Shadowheart,"Oh hells, what? Not another adventure, is it? I'm quite content with my semi-retirement..."
Shadowheart,"Try and behave at least, but if you can't behave... maybe slip me a warning to keep my distance?"
Shadowheart,"Coming from me, that's saying something."
Shadowheart,"That's what concerns me... I don't know. Perhaps there's something about me, waiting to be discovered. Something I won't like."
Shadowheart,"I know. It doesn't make much sense, does it? A whole lifetime of faith, of service... all gone, because of a few words from a stranger..."
Shadowheart,The Mother Superior must have had a reason to deny me the chance to become a Dark Justiciar... perhaps this is the reason? Perhaps I'm simply not worthy.
Shadowheart,"As would I, oddly enough."
Shadowheart,"We already do that, by and large. We journey together, fight together, share food and campfire..."
Shadowheart,Very well. At least you are consistent.
Shadowheart,"But there are bigger, more immediate concerns. Let's put survival first, for now. "
Shadowheart,"The feeling's mutual. I didn't think it needed to be stated again, frankly."
Shadowheart,"We still have use for each other. But perhaps one day, that will no longer be the case."
Shadowheart,Astarion. We need to talk.
Shadowheart,Let's not dance around the subject - I know you're a vampire.
Shadowheart,"Let me see - the deathly-pale skin? The red eyes? The fangs? I'm not blind, you know."
Shadowheart,"The distinction's lost on me, if you still feed on blood."
Shadowheart,Why didn't you tell me?
Shadowheart,"I suppose I can understand that. More than most, perhaps."
Shadowheart,"But no more secrets, understand?"
Shadowheart,"The hypocrisy isn't lost on me. If anything, it makes me more likely to be sympathetic to you than anyone else."
Shadowheart,"Perhaps I'm a better liar than you are, then. All the more reason to be honest with me - I'll see right through you."
Shadowheart,I'll take it on good faith that such a thing exists.
Shadowheart,"Now that we have some semblance of an understanding, did you want anything else?"
Shadowheart,"Coming from you, I'll take that as a victory."
Shadowheart,Indeed. Though perhaps not always with you by my side.
Shadowheart,You think I wouldn't have understood? We've all got a bigger problem to contend with - we need to be able to rely on one another.
Shadowheart,"The truth's out now, no thanks to you. No more secrets, understand?"
Shadowheart,My master forbid me from revealing my true nature.
Shadowheart,I can sympathise. It isn't easy for me to let people know about my faith. Often a lie by omission seems like the safest course.
Shadowheart,I mean... never mind. Let's consider the matter settled.
Shadowheart,"We're all in this together. Provided you can keep your urges in check around me, I don't see why anything has to change."
Shadowheart,"Well, at least I know I won't find you atop me in the middle of the night now."
Shadowheart,"I'll try poison next time. That was a joke, just to be clear."
Shadowheart,You have my sympathies - especially after what Shar did to me. Perhaps you and I met the same ill fortune in who we came to serve.
Shadowheart,Careful. I'm not sure I can withstand the charm.
Shadowheart,Then I won't breathe another word about it. But the sentiment remains the same. Chin up.
Shadowheart,"I'm not entirely without sympathy, I should say. I can't imagine what I'd do if Lady Shar abandoned me."
Shadowheart,"I don't doubt that, funnily enough."
Shadowheart,I tried. Enjoy your new status as pariah.
Shadowheart,I shall. Nightly.
Shadowheart,"I'm not entirely without sympathy, I should say. To fall out with someone you revered... it must be catastrophic."
Shadowheart,"No, I don't think so - you've a tadpole as well but you see fine..."
Shadowheart,"I never claimed to be wise, unfortunately."
Shadowheart,I think you may find you have more than a little healthy competition from would-be tyrants. 
Shadowheart,Lady Shar is patient though - she can wait until the rest of you have torn each other apart.
Shadowheart,"You're the last thing the world needs - another would-be tyrant who thinks they have divine rights. You're just someone's pawn, you know. That's all we are to the gods."
Shadowheart,Gods... I both understand what you mean and am horrified you phrased it like that.
Shadowheart,"Your queen turned on you, and my goddess turned on me. Perhaps we have more in common than we dare admit to."
Shadowheart,"I see. It must be difficult, have someone you revere turn on you. I'm willing to let the past go, if you are as well."
Shadowheart,You took the words right out of my mouth.
Shadowheart,Yet I no longer follow those orders. Shar has abandoned me. The artefact is no longer my mission - saving my family is.
Shadowheart,"And yet, it seems the one who gave those orders has run afoul of my goddess. Delivering the artefact is no longer my mission - cleansing Lady Shar's church is my mission."
Shadowheart,Perhaps we can... come to an arrangement.
Shadowheart,"Having one less enemy to worry about mightn't count for much - not with the odds we're facing... but having more than that - an ally to count on, or even a, well..."
Shadowheart,"Of course it is, and I said nothing about friendship. But a little less tension between us might benefit all."
Shadowheart,And... I'm sorry. For creeping up on you with a dagger. It won't happen again.
Shadowheart,Thank you for the advice. See? We have much to learn from each other.
Shadowheart,Forget I ever said anything. I'm just indulging in thoughts best buried.
Shadowheart,"Don't treat me like an idiot, please. Do you think it was easy for me, to try keeping my faith hidden? I know when someone's burdened with a secret."
Shadowheart,"Don't treat me like an idiot, please. I have a talent for recognising when someone has a secret."
Shadowheart,I can't recall the last time I shared so much with someone - maybe I never did before. It meant a lot to me. You mean a lot to me.
Shadowheart,"I wondered if you'd have kissed me, if you could. It was on my mind all night."
Shadowheart,And that was before the kiss...
Shadowheart,I thought you were going to kiss me. I wanted you to kiss me.
Shadowheart,Don't worry - I think I must have been misjudging you. I can't even remember what it was that made me say that...
Shadowheart,Too many to list. But the fact that you can't figure it out for yourself is very telling.
Shadowheart,"Something the matter? I should hope not, after the time we spent together. My spirits are... thoroughly lifted."
Shadowheart,"Oh? Not feeling any regrets, I hope?"
Shadowheart,I'm glad. I feel the same way.
Shadowheart,Though I'm still finding sand in my hair - I wonder what the others will think of that...
Shadowheart,I suppose it doesn't. I'm glad we have each other. And I hope we'll have more opportunities to slip away.
Shadowheart,But of course they will. I hope we'll have more opportunities to slip away... and make sand castles.
Shadowheart,"Trust me - I'll be an eager pupil, if I have a thorough teacher."
Shadowheart,I'm glad.
Shadowheart,Oh. I'm sorry you feel that way... I don't.
Shadowheart,"Thank you, all the same. You helped me to put some things behind me. I'm... lighter, because of you."
Shadowheart,I'm all ears.
Shadowheart,May Lady Shar's blessings be upon you.
Shadowheart,"Though I have little doubt she is most pleased, after the offering we made together. I know I certainly was..."
Shadowheart,Yes? Do you have notes for me?
Shadowheart,"You flatter me. Perhaps I'll have the chance to reach your heights some time, whenever Lady Shar requires another offering..."
Shadowheart,"Oh. I'd hoped for a little more enthusiasm. Next time, perhaps. The Nightsinger always needs more offerings..."
Shadowheart,"Not always. Some enclaves are content to sacrifice a goat and toast Lady Shar afterwards, but this time was a special occasion. I thought we'd better pull out all the stops."
Shadowheart,I was going to say the very same thing... as soon as I worked up my courage a little.
Shadowheart,I thought you were going to kiss me. I was almost sure of it.
Shadowheart,"I wondered if you'd have kissed me, if you could."
Shadowheart,It didn't feel like a mistake to me. Far from it. But I'll respect your wishes - consider it forgotten. I'm adept at that.
Shadowheart,"Besides, just look at yourself. It couldn't be any more obvious."
Shadowheart,You're a bad liar. And perhaps an untrustworthy ally.
Shadowheart,"Best if you leave me alone, for now."
Shadowheart,"Yes, it's crossed my mind since, more than once. Although..."
Shadowheart,"Well... since then, there's been a few occasions where you've given me doubts. Said things, or done things..."
Shadowheart,Made me wonder if perhaps we're just too different. If we should just let things lie.
Shadowheart,It's not like I've been keeping a list of charges to throw at you. There's just... moments.
Shadowheart,"It might sound harsh, but we're desperate, thrown together by fate. We both might want to see things that aren't truly there."
Shadowheart,Don't. We can't pretend to be someone we're not - either of us. It'll just end badly.
Shadowheart,Let's just... take things in as they come.
Shadowheart,You're right. But I am who I am as well. At least I think so.
Shadowheart,"So, your very own queen has turned on you...? Your people are nothing if not ruthless."
Shadowheart,"Yes, perhaps..."
Shadowheart,Upset...? Of course not. I know a passing distraction when I see one.
Shadowheart,Friends can't keep each other warm at night. But yes. it's good that we have each other...
Shadowheart,"Please, don't remind me. A mistake I'll try to avoid in future."
Shadowheart,All's well I hope...?
Shadowheart,"No. I just wanted to see how you felt, after the night we spent together. When we talked..."
Shadowheart,And kissed.
Shadowheart,"I hope so too... though I'm not sure what kind of courtship we'll be afforded, given all that we're facing."
Shadowheart,"But if you want to see where this goes, I do as well."
Shadowheart,"I would have liked that very much. A strange courtship we've started, isn't it."
Shadowheart,"Oh... I see. Well in that case, I suppose there's nothing more to be said on the matter."
Shadowheart,"Thank you, anyway. For your company."
Shadowheart,I see... perhaps it's for the best.
Shadowheart,Unclean is the ambition. Don't waste your time on guilt - I don't.
Shadowheart,Whatever you think may be compelling you... you may have greater ability to resist it than you realise. Everyone has unseemly thoughts. Being able to quieten them is what sets us apart from the beasts.
Shadowheart,You and I have markedly different ideas of what amounts to a gift...
Shadowheart,"I suppose a friend of nature such as yourself will know how to avoid them - provided you don't turn into one, of course."
Shadowheart,Thank you. I had a feeling you'd be understanding.
Shadowheart,You will? Well... thank you. I appreciate it.
Shadowheart,"You're unlike the Mother Superior, then. "
Shadowheart,Maybe that's what I like about you. You're different.
Shadowheart,"In either case, it's not something I want to dwell on, just now."
Shadowheart,Really? Some might think it makes me a liability.
Shadowheart,I hope so too. I'll try my best to keep it under control.
Shadowheart,That's out of my hands. I think I've said all I want to on the subject.
Shadowheart,You can tell that to the next one we cross paths with then. Provided it doesn't tear your throat out first.
Shadowheart,"I've always been terrified of them, ever since I was a child. I showed you my memory of when I was lost in the woods. It can hardly come as a surprise."
Shadowheart,"The Mother Superior wasn't above using it against me. If I disobeyed, sometimes instead of a whipping, she'd threaten to drag me to a wolf den. Never failed to bring me back in line."
Shadowheart,"Why is it always the bad memories I can still recall...? In any case, I'll be keen to avoid them."
Shadowheart,Fine. What's on your mind?
Shadowheart,Very serious of you. But go ahead.
Shadowheart,Speaking out of turn is an indiscretion. Trying to drink my blood is something else entirely.
Shadowheart,"Don't try it again. If you feel the urge, go find yourself a sheep or something."
Shadowheart,"So you're a vampire, Astarion? I suppose I shouldn't really act surprised - the signs are not exactly subtle, if you care to look."
Shadowheart,"You know... I had my suspicions, but I didn't want to act on them. And now it seems I won't have to."
Shadowheart,And you've been keeping this from me all this time...? I thought we trusted one another.
Shadowheart,So... a vampire spawn. Is my throat safe?
Shadowheart,"Somehow, I'm not sure I'll take your word for it just yet. A little more trust needs to be cultivated first."
Shadowheart,"Concerned about turning into a monster? You're already halfway there, by most standards."
Shadowheart,"I suppose fear doesn't have to be rational. But maybe, given time, I can put it behind me."
Shadowheart,"Well the truth's out now, for what it's worth. Are we done?"
Shadowheart,"It all stems from that childhood memory I suppose... it's strange. I know now that it was my father I saw, yet still, I can't suppress the fear."
Shadowheart,"And some might say eels and turnips boiled in milk is a delicacy, but some are fools. I'll make my own mind up. "
Shadowheart,And I haven't forgotten that you saved my life aboard the nautiloid. Perhaps I'll be able to return the favour at some point.
Shadowheart,"If nothing else, you can at least soak up any arrows that are loosed at us."
Shadowheart,"Pity. You'd started off so well, saving my life aboard the nautiloid. I suppose now I'm seeing the real you."
Shadowheart,You saved my life aboard the nautiloid. I'd never have expected that from a gith.
Shadowheart,"And since then, you've seemed reliable. Maybe I'll have to reevaluate what I think I know about your kind."
Shadowheart,"But since then, well... let's just say some of my suspicions have been confirmed."
Shadowheart,"My estimations started at a low point as far as you're concerned, gith."
Shadowheart,But I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong... you seem good company so far.
Shadowheart,Though I suppose the only way is up from there. You'll do for now.
Shadowheart,I'm watching you.
Shadowheart,Only one Chosen remains - and that's still one too many.
Shadowheart,Gortash will want to hear of this.
Shadowheart,Seems like even those were too high.
Shadowheart,I suppose some would commend our actions - goblins would've razed that whole place to nothing if it weren't for us.
Shadowheart,"If we hadn't killed the goblins' leaders, they'd have turned that grove to ashes. We're owed quite a debt, I believe."
Shadowheart,No excuse to rest on our laurels though - we've still got our own problems to contend with.
Shadowheart,"What's there to think about? Goblins spilled blood, but we survived. That's all that matters."
Shadowheart,That place is sealed off to the world now - I don't see the point in dwelling on it any more. Not while we've our own problems to see to.
Shadowheart,We haven't gone all that far yet - what are you referring to exactly...?<br>
Shadowheart,"The powers we already received have proved useful, true. But this is something different entirely..."
Shadowheart,"On one hand, they seem useful. But on the other hand - or perhaps tentacle, before long - we know where they're coming from, and what lies at the end of that path..."
Shadowheart,"Well... perhaps you have a point. Fine, let's explore these powers then. I just hope we don't come to regret it."
Shadowheart,I see it as more a case of wisely avoiding a potential threat. My mind is set.
Shadowheart,It's been known to happen.
Shadowheart,"True. Your proclivities might not matter at all soon enough, if we don't find a cure."
Shadowheart,I sincerely hope you're worth the trouble.
Shadowheart,"Well, let's hope he keeps his distance."
Shadowheart,Would you have had the self-control to not drain me dry if I hadn't stirred? I'm not sure I want to think about it.
Shadowheart,"I hope you can keep your cravings in check, going forward. Otherwise, I think you and I will be parting ways - understood?"
Shadowheart,"A vampire could make for an interesting ally in combat, if nothing else."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar willed it to fall... though even I won't quite revel in all those deaths as much as you. The unfaithful were vanquished, but I have little interest in slavering over their corpses."
Shadowheart,Hmm... perhaps.
Shadowheart,Good. I knew you had what it took to quieten your demons. I'd hate to have lost the real you.
Shadowheart,You are quite remarkable. 
Shadowheart,"We aren't dear friends now, if that's what you're asking."
Shadowheart,"But I trust we can all sleep a little more soundly in camp now - well, apart from you, of course."
Shadowheart,But I trust we can all sleep a little more soundly in camp now.
Shadowheart,Relax. We'll kiss and make up on our own time.
Shadowheart,Someone prodding at a newly opened wound doesn't help matters.
Shadowheart,And get murdered by a pack of goblins or gnolls instead?
Shadowheart,"Lae'zel might be a reluctant ally, but she is good at killing. I'll point her in their direction."
Shadowheart,"You have an interesting definition of 'friendly', but yes."
Shadowheart,"No, I think you'd stab me from the front, if it came to that."
Shadowheart,Although... perhaps it won't.
Shadowheart,Don't sound so disappointed. 
Shadowheart,We could always spar if you want to practise.
Shadowheart,Yet. 
Shadowheart,"When we make it to Baldur's Gate, you'll be at home in the slaughterhouses."
Shadowheart,"I'd be lying if I said I hadn't noticed the spasms and the fainting spells. You have my commiserations - I think I know how it must feel, in a sense."
Shadowheart,"Still, we're lucky nobody died - I hope you can keep your cravings in check, going forward. Otherwise, I think you and I will be parting ways - understood?"
Shadowheart,There's nothing more for you to uncover here. Let it rest.
Shadowheart,"And by that, I mean, never bring up the subject again."
Shadowheart,It isn't. Now let's leave it at that.
Shadowheart,Only a glancing blow. Clearly gith aren't quite the killers they believe themselves to be.
Shadowheart,"Well, the truth's out now, in either case. Did you want something else?"
Shadowheart,I knew there was something untrustworthy about you.
Shadowheart,"You have a faraway look on your face, Astarion. Did you forget what you were going to say? Happens to the best of us."
Shadowheart,"So you're not in full control of your faculties. If you think it might happen again, warn me. I would hate to have to kill you."
Shadowheart,I should have known you were a vampire - the signs were there.
Shadowheart,Peckish...?!
Shadowheart,What happened was my dagger finding the back of her throat.
Shadowheart,Are you looking for the lurid details?
Shadowheart,"You do that. I'll do something more productive, like find a cure."
Shadowheart,That is... a great deal of trust.
Shadowheart,"I appreciate it, but keep your guard up around others. We're gathering enemies by the day."
Shadowheart,"You're hardly alone - bloodletting is quite popular of late. Though your twinge of conscience sets you apart from the brigands, monsters and kill-happy fiends of the world..."
Shadowheart,Plumbing for guilt is pointless. I did what I must.
Shadowheart,I understand why you ask but memory loss is not as uncommon as you'd think. There may be other causes.
Shadowheart,"I've seen your resolve. Whatever is trying to control you, you're stronger."
Shadowheart,"I suppose that makes you quite remarkable... though not in a way I'd envy, perhaps."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar chose me also, but because of the blood I spilled, not what flows in my veins. You are born of murder itself... perhaps your fate is out of your hands."
Shadowheart,"From what little I can recall hearing of Bhaal's mortal children, not all succumbed to his influence. Perhaps you can still resist your nature... if you want to."
Shadowheart,How kind of you to remind me. But I don't think so - you've a tadpole too and seem stronger than ever.
Shadowheart,I'll just have to try get some more rest when we next stop to camp...
Shadowheart,"She went mad, now she's dead. What's there to talk about?"
Shadowheart,"No loss to our little venture, either way."
Shadowheart,Don't waste your time deciphering the actions of a lunatic.
Shadowheart,Only a glancing blow. Clearly you gith aren't quite the killers they believe themselves to be.
Shadowheart,I won't regret defending myself. There's nothing more to it.
Shadowheart,Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I belong to Lady Shar - don't waste your time coveting what you can never truly have.
Shadowheart,"I can sympathise, actually. With some secrets, well... often a lie by omission seems like the safest course."
Shadowheart,"I do. Don't worry. It gets easier and easier, the further you venture into the darkness."
Shadowheart,Have you ever considered entering into politics? You've some form with giving non-answers.
Shadowheart,"Good. I did this for Lady Shar, for myself... but I had hoped you'd like it as well."
Shadowheart,This hairstyle is closer to Lady Shar's own image. I did it to honour her... what do you think?
Shadowheart,Notice anything new?<br>
Shadowheart,He betrayed Lady Shar. There can be no forgiveness for that.
Shadowheart,At least he's proof you can turn from Shar and live to tell the tale. Though some may not call that living...
Shadowheart,That 'almost' is doing a great deal of heavy lifting. That man changes allegiances more frequently than a courtesan changes her bedsheets.
Shadowheart,"The Shadow Curse... it doesn't seem to affect me like it does others. Not as badly, at least."
Shadowheart,"I've been lied to, my whole life. And I was gullible enough to just believe it."
Shadowheart,"If I was a bard, I might be tempted to draw comparisons between nature and myself both shaking off Shar... but luckily for you, I'm no bard."
Shadowheart,These lands will soon be free of Shar's grasp. You can almost sense it.
Shadowheart,"A necessary sacrifice, so that I can press onwards. The Dark Lady will understand, surely."
Shadowheart,No matter. She wishes for Ketheric Thorm to be punished... Her darkness was a blessing offered before he betrayed her. She can redirect her powers elsewhere once he is cast down.
Shadowheart,"No matter. She wished for Ketheric Thorm to be punished, and he has been. Her darkness was a blessing offered before he betrayed her. She can redirect her powers elsewhere."
Shadowheart,"Which isn't to say we needn't have any use for each other, from time to time..."
Shadowheart,Difficult to say - a fellow servant of the Nightsinger would surely be an ally to me under most circumstances... but something doesn't add up. I'll need to see where his allegiances truly lie.
Shadowheart,A night orchid - my favourite. One of the few things I can actually remember clearly. They're not exactly common; perhaps finding one is a good omen.
Shadowheart,If you insist. Anything else?
Shadowheart,"Come on, that's not a question you ask for no reason - what are you hiding?"
Shadowheart,"Ahem, no you shall not. I'd hate to reward a kind gesture by breaking your fingers. Give me some time - I'll see if there's a way I can make it up to you."
Shadowheart,"Well, perhaps I can come up with something later, all the same."
Shadowheart,We'll see. Give me a while to put my imagination to work.
Shadowheart,"I don't have anything to give you in return, I'm afraid."
Shadowheart,Joking. They're safe - and beautiful. Thank you.
Shadowheart,Rings a bell... why?
Shadowheart,"When the chance arises, I must speak to Nightsong again. Whatever she claims to know... It may just help me make sense of everything."
Shadowheart,You'll need to make some room for me first - seems like you have ample company already.
Shadowheart,"Honest of you. And you're right - this is about me, and how I can best serve Lady Shar."
Shadowheart,I'm afraid you're stuck with me for the moment - I can't reach camp just now.
Shadowheart,"Last Light is no more. Lady Shar's darkness will have swept away all resistance, thanks to my sacrifice."
Shadowheart,"Neither did I... but I can hazard a guess, with hindsight."
Shadowheart,"I suppose I'm adept at that. I just need to shut out all distractions, focus on what Lady Shar demands of me."
Shadowheart,Nothing is simple anymore. Sometimes it feels like all I have are doubts.
Shadowheart,"When I ate the noblestalk, I remembered I had a friend. But all I have is a name, and a face. There must be more..."
Shadowheart,"Wandering to places I shouldn't go, at that. Forbidden thoughts, hidden memories... all that Lady Shar would shield me from, until I am ready."
Shadowheart,"I'll admit it, staying true to Lady Shar has proved difficult at times. I've found that my mind is prone to wandering."
Shadowheart,Perhaps not... but it's difficult to surrender something so beautiful...
Shadowheart,"It may just be a coincidence, but yes... sometimes it feels like any stirring of affection is rewarded with sheer agony."
Shadowheart,"Lady Shar does not see mercy as a virtue, even to simple creatures..."
Shadowheart,Is that so? Well I hope you don't intend to make such a claim without some evidence to support it.
Shadowheart,"I know. One crisis at a time, eh? Still, I must see this done, when the moment arises."
Shadowheart,"We need to get to Baldur's Gate, first of all."
Shadowheart,No. It's nothing that can do any harm. Simply... a gesture. But an important one.
Shadowheart,I intend to. I've wasted enough time serving others.
Shadowheart,You'll see for yourself soon enough. Just leave it with me.
Shadowheart,But before that... there's one thing I need to see to.
Shadowheart,"We'd better press on for now, and hope we're ready when the moment comes."
Shadowheart,"Indeed, but the truth may yet prove painful. Who knows what Shar still keeps from me."
Shadowheart,Not if you enjoy having your head attached to your neck. She stole my family from me. She stole my life. Whatever reason she has isn't good enough.
Shadowheart,"That may be so, but this is something I need to do myself. You'll have to forgive me if I'm a little wary of goddesses just now."
Shadowheart,"Thank you, but I want you to refrain from foolish heroics - when the time comes, we will be entering a nest of vipers. I couldn't bear to lose you. Not after everything."
Shadowheart,"My parents are alive, and I have to save them. I think a part of me always knew that - a part that Shar denied to me. "
Shadowheart,"Yes... but also no. I felt like the world had been upended, but it also made perfect sense."
Shadowheart,"What, are you praying to Selûne? Somehow I don't think she's listening to her followers, just now."
Shadowheart,"Take a moment, if you need it. I didn't know this would happen - truly."
Shadowheart,"It matters little, either way. Lady Shar claims everything, in the end. Last Light is a testament to that."
Shadowheart,"Besides, they put themselves in harm's way, then were arrogant enough to try and withstand the Nightsinger's power instead of fleeing. You can't help those who aren't willing to help themselves."
Shadowheart,I don't recall you stopping me - you had every opportunity.
Shadowheart,"Still, though... I wonder if there's more to it. Surely they could have held out at the inn for at least a while... unless they, too, felt Nightsong's passing."
Shadowheart,"For the best, perhaps. More difficult for me to ruin things if I just keep out of the way."
Shadowheart,These lands may not be under the thrall of Lady Shar for much longer.
Shadowheart,"Let's just forget that little encounter ever happened, shall we?"
Shadowheart,Do you really need to ask?
Shadowheart,"I'm sorry. I have a lot on my mind... the Shadowfell, Nightsong... I can think of little else."
Shadowheart,That's not the first time you've made such a leap.
Shadowheart,But perhaps there's more to it than I know - or would care to admit.
Shadowheart,I suppose you're right... there's nothing more I can do just yet.
Shadowheart,"I don't know. Maybe it's a Selûnite trick, or another way for Lady Shar to test my faith."
Shadowheart,After I failed her.
Shadowheart,You wanted something?
Shadowheart,That's more true than you may have intended. I'm not sure I am the same person I was before. 
Shadowheart,"I'm trying. But I need answers. I need to know what happened in the Shadowfell wasn't for nothing,"
Shadowheart,"Forgiveness? No, I don't think so. Part of me hopes that this is another test, or that there is some way to earn my way back into the Dark Lady's graces."
Shadowheart,But I felt her anger. There's no point in denying this is real.
Shadowheart,"Yes, I'm counting on it - I have little else to turn to."
Shadowheart,"I know, it's just... hard to look past this. I feel like a huge part of me is missing. And worse still, I feel I cut it out, myself."
Shadowheart,Don't thank me. I didn't do it for her. I'm not even sure I did it for me.
Shadowheart,Thank you. I think any attempts at comforting me might be in vain just now... but you're sweet to keep me in your thoughts.
Shadowheart,"The sooner I speak to Nightsong, the sooner I'll know what the future holds for me - assuming I have a future at all."
Shadowheart,Same as anyone. Lady Shar's blessings... they're gone.
Shadowheart,"It's nothing, forget it. Too much time in my own head."
Shadowheart,Sorry. Was lost in thought... something the matter?
Shadowheart,"That's gone. The Lady of Loss took those burdens from me. Now I serve. Embrace who I am, or don't. It won't change a thing."
Shadowheart,Just remember that you helped me reach my potential. What you see before you are the fruits of your labours. 
Shadowheart,"Oh. Your loss, trust me. I'm sure there will be plenty who'll help me honour the Dark Lady."
Shadowheart,Nothing. I belong to Lady Shar - don't waste your time coveting what you can never truly have.<br>
Shadowheart,You certainly did. It was spectacular.
Shadowheart,"Don't worry. It gets easier and easier, the further you venture into the darkness."
Shadowheart,"I think I know what you mean. There's an undeniable rapport, and yet we haven't made time for each other. Time alone."
Shadowheart,"I don't fully know... just a nagging feeling. Almost like I'm conflicted about something, but I don't quite know what. "
Shadowheart,"Easily remedied, if you like. I know a place."
Shadowheart,"That should do nicely. It'll be worth the trek back, I promise. We can go in your own time, but let's be careful advance too far forwards. I'd hate for us to miss our chance because events took a turn."
Shadowheart,"Not just yet - let's choose our moment. Some quiet night, when the others are asleep and there's no distractions, I'll come for you."
Shadowheart,"Oh. Another time, of course."
Shadowheart,Did I? Don't worry - I was probably just too busy drinking in the sight of you.
Shadowheart,"Oh... if that's how you feel about it, fine. Not every sapling is destined to grow tall, I suppose."
Shadowheart,I hesitated? Probably because I was coming to realise what a poor match we are for each other.
Shadowheart,"Hmm, yes. I would have been better off getting some rest I think. Let's leave it at that."
Shadowheart,"Well, perhaps easy isn't quite the right word - we'll have to retrace our steps back out of the Shadow Curse. I'd like to get to know you better without worrying about hazardous surroundings, if it's all the same."
Shadowheart,I'm sorry. It might be best kept until later. I'd be a poor counsel and worse company just now.
Shadowheart,I know enough. But I'll risk it over certain death.
Wyll,As one does.
Wyll,This better be good.
Wyll,Checking it out.
Wyll,I love surprises.
Wyll,Just a peek.
Wyll,Laying low.
Wyll,There we are.
Wyll,Under cover.
Wyll,Going quiet.
Wyll,Just the bare minimum.
Wyll,Nothing but trouble.
Wyll,Miracle worker.
Wyll,I've got an idea...
Wyll,If it can't wait.
Wyll,Saving the day.
Wyll,As you need.
Wyll,The greater good.
Wyll,I'll do what I can.
Wyll,I find moderation is key.
Wyll,As my father once told me: 'Can we get on with it?'
Wyll,Wear your scars proudly.
Wyll,Can't hear myself think!
Wyll,That won't do.
Wyll,Can't do it without you.
Wyll,None can escape me!
Wyll,So it goes.
Wyll,A quick dip.
Wyll,I'll get you free!
Wyll,Putting my talents to use.
Wyll,A calculated risk.
Wyll,Caution to the wind!
Wyll,I'll patch you right up.
Wyll,The touch of life.
Wyll,I'm down!
Wyll,Help...
Wyll,I need a hand... quickly!
Wyll,Healer! Please!
Wyll,Mizora... is that... you?
Wyll,I can't die here... not now...
Wyll,I don't want to die!
Wyll,The man for the job.
Wyll,Here for you.
Wyll,A friendly face.
Wyll,Fine time for a chat.
Wyll,"A delight, surely."
Wyll,Bad time for an itch.
Wyll,Could do for a brew.
Wyll,So two halflings walk under a bar...
Wyll,Let's take a look.<br>
Wyll,Proper inspiration.
Wyll,Some pep for your step.
Wyll,"Where there's a 'Wyll', there's a 'y'."
Wyll,Ever get the sense that someone's watching?
Wyll,A bit of a bind.
Wyll,A good trick.
Wyll,Every little bit helps.
Wyll,I've found my mark.
Wyll,How 'bout a hand?
Wyll,I've got it covered.
Wyll,Coming for you!
Wyll,I've got your back!
Wyll,Stay with me!
Wyll,Our tale's not over.
Wyll,Don't worry - I've got this!
Wyll,Don't worry - I've got this!<br>
Wyll,Help's on the way!
Wyll,Let's see what you've got.
Wyll,My need is greater.
Wyll,A life worth saving.
Wyll,Keep strong!
Wyll,I won't fail you!
Wyll,Here goes nothing.
Wyll,Getting it done.
Wyll,At your service!
Wyll,Could come in handy.
Wyll,"What's this, now?"
Wyll,Mine!
Wyll,"I'll help myself, shall I?"
Wyll,Just can't resist.
Wyll,That's what I'm here for.<br>
Wyll,Coming to help.
Wyll,Need a boost?
Wyll,Sorting you out.
Wyll,Taste the Blade!
Wyll,"Today, you fall!"
Wyll,Unleash the legend!
Wyll,I'm going in.
Wyll,Strike from the shadows.
Wyll,You will fall by my hand.
Wyll,Hit 'em hard!
Wyll,Attack! Attack!
Wyll,Into the fray!
Wyll,Let's get it done.
Wyll,Let's get it done.<br>
Wyll,I won't let you down.
Wyll,Easing your burden.
Wyll,A friend in deed.
Wyll,"Sure, why not?"
Wyll,Let's chew the fat.
Wyll,"A word, if I may."
Wyll,As a favour.
Wyll,Hero on demand.
Wyll,You should be more careful.
Wyll,I'll always come through.
Wyll,Stronger together.
Wyll,Let my enemies fall!
Wyll,I've found my mark!
Wyll,Might will prevail!
Wyll,For the Sword Coast!
Wyll,Watch and learn!
Wyll,What could go wrong?
Wyll,Healing you up.
Wyll,Happy to help!
Wyll,This should do the trick!
Wyll,A tight scrape.
Wyll,Down but not out.
Wyll,I better hurry.<br>
Wyll,I better hurry.
Wyll,We will prevail!
Wyll,Here for you!
Wyll,I won't turn my back!
Wyll,Looks simple enough.
Wyll,We should catch up.
Wyll,Well hello!
Wyll,Splendid!
Wyll,Up and at 'em!
Wyll,I could use company.
Wyll,Fortune favours the bold!
Wyll,Done and done!
Wyll,I've got you!
Wyll,I won't let you down!
Wyll,They won't see me coming.<br>
Wyll,Silence is golden.
Wyll,Toning things down.
Wyll,Going on the sly.
Wyll,Careful...
Wyll,Steady now.
Wyll,Making my move!
Wyll,It takes talent.
Wyll,Need some healing?
Wyll,The cure for what ails you.
Wyll,Trapped? I suppose I could help.
Wyll,Hold it together!
Wyll,On the prowl.
Wyll,I'll see what I can do.
Wyll,The magic touch.
Wyll,No trouble at all.
Wyll,Strength in silence.
Wyll,Keeping quiet.
Wyll,Watching and waiting.
Wyll,Buck up already.
Wyll,"Eyes open, mouth shut."
Wyll,"Out of sight, out of mind."
Wyll,Doing my duty.
Wyll,I need an edge.
Wyll,Let's not make a habit of this.
Wyll,Could be a help.
Wyll,A bright idea.
Wyll,I know just what to do.
Wyll,What are friends for?
Wyll,In it goes!
Wyll,Making haste.
Wyll,Bet on the Blade.
Wyll,"By Balduran's bones, I've got you!"
Wyll,No one left behind!
Wyll,Stay calm - I'm coming!
Wyll,You can't get yourself out?
Wyll,Two steps at a time!
Wyll,Better hurry!
Wyll,Fleet of foot.
Wyll,Coming through!
Wyll,I'm making this quick.
Wyll,Not my first choice.
Wyll,Not a peep.
Wyll,Every step counts.
Wyll,Can't avoid 'em forever.
Wyll,I don't see why not.
Wyll,The Blade's got you!
Wyll,Quiet as a moonbeam.
Wyll,How about a pick-me-up?
Wyll,Keep calm - I'm coming!
Wyll,You can count on me!
Wyll,This really can't wait.
Wyll,A helpful hand.
Wyll,That's what I'm here for.
Wyll,Let's patch you up.
Wyll,Making you better.
Wyll,Sharp as ever.
Wyll,Sharp as ever.<br>
Wyll,Blade at the ready.
Wyll,A hero at heart.
Wyll,Where am I needed?<br>
Wyll,Where am I needed?
Wyll,Defender of the people.
Wyll,The pride of the Gate.
Wyll,Up and at 'em.
Wyll,Breaking my silence.
Wyll,Let me help!
Wyll,A quick word.
Wyll,No holding back!
Wyll,No holding back!<br>
Wyll,Battle favours the fearless.
Wyll,Forever dauntless!
Wyll,On the victor's path.
Wyll,The Blade will not bend!
Wyll,Let's make it count.
Wyll,To the rescue. Of course.
Wyll,A clear necessity.
Wyll,Ever onward.
Wyll,Checking things out.
Wyll,I'll get you fit as a fox.
Wyll,I've got just the fix.
Wyll,Keeping pace.
Wyll,Two steps at a time.
Wyll,The Blade provides.
Wyll,You won't feel a thing.
Wyll,One move ahead.
Wyll,That lock's made for picking.
Wyll,I'll take a crack.
Wyll,Best foot forward.
Wyll,Breathe easy.
Wyll,And I'm off.
Wyll,"Finders, keepers."
Wyll,There for the taking.
Wyll,Finding my way.
Wyll,Let's give it a go.
Wyll,"Unfettered slaughter, no more and no less. I thought better of Shadowheart. That was mistake."
Wyll,Oh goodness. Is it all that bad? I'm dreadfully out of practise.
Wyll,The devil is fallen.
Wyll,Surely.
Wyll,I'm glad. I want that too.
Wyll,"Just do me a favour - make it a story worth telling, a life worth living. You deserve nothing less."
Wyll,Ah. You're the author of your own story. You get to choose which part I play.
Wyll,"I saw our future in my dreams: grand adventures, tender moments, and all the wonders in between them."
Wyll,I - I don't know what to say.
Wyll,"You make a damn fun dance partner, too."
Wyll,"You are the red of the sunrise, the yellow of high noon, and the orange of sundown. If you were a song, I'd never stop singing; if you were a psalm, I'd never stop praying."
Wyll,Ah. How to answer a question with so many layers as that?
Wyll,"Fortune willing, as the seasons of life pass into winter and my hair goes to grey, you'll still be within my quivering arm's reach."
Wyll,"And one day, I might even call you consort to Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard of Baldur's Gate. My pride, my joy."
Wyll,"You are my yesterday, my today, and my tomorrow."
Wyll,"A few moonrises back, I thought the answer was complicated. But it's quite simple, really:"
Wyll,We'll have our chance. I'm sure of it.
Wyll,"I want nothing more. Unique as your heart might be, I still feel it tugging at mine."
Wyll,"I know. But until that day comes, I'm content just knowing you're near."
Wyll,As if you needed to ask.
Wyll,My favourite subject.
Wyll,But these parasites are quite literally illithid weapons of war. And I'm not so certain they won't be turned against us upon consuming them.
Wyll,"I appreciate where you're coming from. Truly, I do."
Wyll,"Hells. I should be celebrating, making toasts, roaring in victory."
Wyll,"If the tadpole must be my curse, then let the powers it grants me be the Sword Coast's blessing. I will consume what I must to make it so."
Wyll,But I can't get the tadpole's visions out of my mind. Tell me we were right to strike Karlach down.
Wyll,Not exactly the words of solace I'd hoped for.
Wyll,The truth will out before you know it.
Wyll,"I have never called myself 'hero', but I am bound to an oath."
Wyll,I can say only this: Karlach's not the only one who's had a villain's knife held to their throats.
Wyll,"You've been witness to a pantomime, I'm sorry to say. And I've played my part all too poorly."
Wyll,"Thank you, Karlach. But if it brings our ally here any comfort, a reckoning's coming - and I'll be the one to pay up."
Wyll,You don't know the half of it.
Wyll,And you'll have them. But I can't promise you'll like them.
Wyll,"You're not in any danger, I promise. I can't say the same about me."
Wyll,"One night soon when we make camp, the veil will be lifted and I'll face my penance."
Wyll,You're closer than you know.
Wyll,It means that a reckoning's coming. And I'll be the one to pay up.
Wyll,Not so much a story as a pantomime. And I've played my part all too poorly.
Wyll,"Soon we'll camp, and you'll have your answers. More than you bargained for, in fact."
Wyll,"You're not the only one who's had a villain's knife held to your throat, Karlach."
Wyll,"Ah. Well, let the silent winds carry word of our conquest."
Wyll,"Hrm. Well, then - hail to our champion, and let there be no substitute for victory."
Wyll,Hail again. And may our strikes always find their marks.
Wyll,Why should this time be any different? My prey has fallen. Hail the Blade!
Wyll,"I've slayed myriad devils, each one a threat to Faerûn. I've torn the horns from their heads without a second thought."
Wyll,"Hmm - right you are, Lae'zel."
Wyll,"Dammit all. I vowed to hunt vicious monsters, not join their ranks."
Wyll,I like your conviction.
Wyll,"Still, I am the frontiers' avowed protector. New dangers require new skills to vanquish them."
Wyll,"Yes - I suppose we should, though I'm more than a bit wary."
Wyll,"I'm more than a bit wary, I admit..."
Wyll,"My father is infected, same as us - or have you forgotten? If we can be cured, so could he."
Wyll,Don't act like what you did was noble.
Wyll,It was a sacrifice you should have avoided.
Wyll,"Someday, I might forgive this. But I won't forget."
Wyll,"There will be no more more dancing, no more 'us'. Someday, I might forgive this. But I won't forget."
Wyll,"Instead, you painted the audience hall with my father's blood."
Wyll,"My father's fallen, all because you lost every lick of good sense!"
Wyll,"By the Ninth Hell of Baator, what devil must have possessed you, that you'd move against Gortash?!"
Wyll,"By all the hounds of the Hells, what is she planning?"
Wyll,"Until then, may my father keep safe, whatever coop he's been flown to."
Wyll,I can already feel her tightening the leash. This might be my last chance to escape it.
Wyll,Let's make camp when we're able. Mizora will be waiting.
Wyll,I couldn't even fathom a guess - though I doubt we'll need to wait long for answers.
Wyll,Mizora's always worth hearing out. That's what make her so dangerous.
Wyll,We'll have answers soon enough. Let's talk to Mizora.
Wyll,We'll have answers soon enough. Mizora's gone to camp. We should speak with her.
Wyll,Hmph. A little too eager for my liking. Well -
Wyll,Certainly not - but she's as inevitable as Toril's path around the sun.
Wyll,"By the hounds of the Hells, what is she planning?"
Wyll,"'A devil of a proposal.' By all the hounds of the Hells, what is she planning?"
Wyll,Shit. Father's been taken - and Mizora's started to scheme.
Wyll,"Unthinkable, to see my own father name Gortash the sole ruler of Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,"Please, we need to speak with him. Maybe - maybe he can see reason..."
Wyll,"By the Ninth Hell of Baator, what devil must have possessed us, that we'd move against Gortash?!"
Wyll,"Instead, we painted the audience hall with my father's blood."
Wyll,"I can't say I'm not curious. But once you take an illithid by the talon, there's no telling how deep into the abyss it might drag you."
Wyll,I think that unknowable powers come with unknowable consequences.
Wyll,You spoke with my father.
Wyll,"Gortash hasn't made Baldur's Gate safe - he's made it a prison. And when his army breaks through, the people will have nowhere to run."
Wyll,Step one: Create an army and order it to march on the city. Step two: Shut the gates in the name of security. Step three: Bask in the applause.
Wyll,Are you so heartless that you'd ask the oppressed to suffer? Are you so mindless that you don't see through blatant political scheming?
Wyll,A crisis created by the same man who shut them out.
Wyll,"To make Baldur's Gate a safe haven, we'll first need to bathe Gortash and Orin in their own blood."
Wyll,There is no negotiating with the dead gods' Chosen. They know only the language of punishment and pain.
Wyll,"To make this city a safe haven, we'll first need to bathe Gortash and his allies in their own blood."
Wyll,"One night soon when we make camp, the veil will be lifted and I'll pay my penance."
Wyll,"As long as Gortash is in charge, they'll be left shivering at the gates. All part of the plan, of course."
Wyll,"A decade ago, Baldur's Gate would have welcomed any- and everyone seeking refuge."
Wyll,It's a damned travesty.
Wyll,I won't let the Absolute keep him. This is my pledge.
Wyll,"Godsdammit, Karlach. You'd sacrifice my father just to have vengeance?"
Wyll,Don't act like what we did was noble.
Wyll,It was a sacrifice we should have avoided.
Wyll,"We had every chance to tame our rage - but we fed it, whet its claws, and let it loose."
Wyll,I'm sorry too.
Wyll,What becomes of the Blade of Frontiers when he slays the man he vowed to save? What pride should this city have for a son who kills its brightest star?
Wyll,"I think we should have tamed our rage - not feed it, whet its claws, and set it loose!"
Wyll,"Who would take in these souls, if not the jewel of Balduran?"
Wyll,You're closer than you'd think.
Wyll,"If it brings you any comfort, my reckoning's coming."
Wyll,Karlach is fallen?!
Wyll,"In the frontiers, there is no posturing, no diplomacy. I slay monsters, I don't consort with them."
Wyll,But a duke makes bedfellows with more monsters than he slays. Father called it 'diplomacy'. I called it 'hypocrisy'.
Wyll,"He reckoned I'd follow in his footsteps - first as a Fist Marshal, then as a duke. Vanquish evil, maintain order, save the world."
Wyll,Father taught me the four pillars of power. Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice.
Wyll,Yes. And no.
Wyll,"I promise, 'clumsy oaf' is well within my repertoire."
Wyll,"Ha! Well, give it some time, develop a bond, and - maybe I'll show you a move or two."
Wyll,"Tempting. Give it some time, develop a bond, and - maybe I'll show you a move or two."
Wyll,Ahem. It's been a badger's age since I've twinkled my toes. A drunk ogre could put on a better show.
Wyll,Not to say I didn't develop a taste for good wine and a talent for courtly dance.
Wyll,I spent more time duelling with father than I did rubbing elbows with lords.
Wyll,"He made a name for himself among the Flaming Fist. Brave as Balduran, stubborn as a deep rothé. Daring, outspoken - but hardly posh."
Wyll,"Father's the son of a blacksmith, born with barely a coin in the coffers."
Wyll,"Not so enchanting as you'd think. The Portyrs, the Caldwells - they were the bluebloods hosting the fancy balls and drinking from gold goblets."
Wyll,"I should've said sooner, I know - but it's a complicated matter."
Wyll,"Should the Absolute cultists infect him, there's no telling the damage he might do when he's returned to the city."
Wyll,We must rescue father from Moonrise. He is a powerful man - the most beloved duke in Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,"That name - 'Gortash'. I know of him. A so-called 'military advisor' to the Baldur's Gate elite. A weapons dealer, in cruder terms."
Wyll,But my heart still aches to think he's been taken by these... cultists.
Wyll,"Hardy stock, perhaps. But father was born to a labourer, not an aristocrat."
Wyll,Hells - Ulder Ravengard's been taken?
Wyll,Even if I might look like one.
Wyll,Well - not when I can avoid it.
Wyll,"Hear, hear! Though truth be told, I'd sooner down a week-old hooch at a ramshackle inn."
Wyll,Better company. And a better buzz.
Wyll,You're the author of your own story. You get to choose who plays which part.
Wyll,I hope Astarion makes you happy. You deserve it.
Wyll,"If Florrick says he lives, then he lives, and we need to free him from his captors. You see - Grand Duke Ravengard is my father."
Wyll,"I know I haven't said. Our relation was no matter of pride, not least for him."
Wyll,I know him better than most. He's my father.
Wyll,Then we need to seek him out and get him to safety. You see - Grand Duke Ravengard is my father.
Wyll,"The man I call father is Ulder Ravengard, a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,Not a secret so much as... an omission.
Wyll,The inevitable consequence of inseparable events.
Wyll,You still deserved to know. There is more to me than infernal power and pacts.
Wyll,Dammit it all to the Hells. You left Waukeen's Rest to burn - and Grand Duke Ravengard to burn along with it.
Wyll,"He is the force that holds the city together. Without him, the winds alone might be enough to raze it."
Wyll,There is. But my pact forbids me from telling it. I'm sorry.
Wyll,"I should've said sooner. But our relation was no matter of pride, not least for him."
Wyll,"The man I call my father. More precisely, Grand Duke Ravengard of Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,You're incredibly kind. But you earned the right to hear this long ago.
Wyll,And I fear I've been less than honest.
Wyll,"First a parasite prods at our heads. Then the shadows close in. More than ever, we need each other's trust."
Wyll,Hells - father's been taken to Moonrise?
Wyll,"I like to think I did, anyway. I'll have to let you be the judge."
Wyll,"But I gained his virtues, too. Courage. Insight. A just heart. A strategic mind."
Wyll,"I suppose the acorn didn't fall far from the tree. The sins of the father live with the son, eh?"
Wyll,"And a treasured one. Under his command, the Flaming Fist mercenary company has thwarted countless threats against Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,"Men, women, children, all barred from entry. A damned travesty."
Wyll,"Me, well - I've never been able to escape my father's name, try as I might."
Wyll,Courage and confidence. You would have made a fine daughter to my father.
Wyll,My story is one of two men.
Wyll,I know. And you're right.
Wyll,"Whatever the reason, they've seized not just a Grand Duke, but the very future of Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,"All the more reason to find him. The Absolute has seized not just my father, but the future of the Sword Coast."
Wyll,- he could lead Baldur's Gate to ruin.
Wyll,His absence alone will sow chaos in the city. If they were to infect him -
Wyll,"No, this is no drow plot. These Absolute nutters, these 'True Souls', are behind his abduction."
Wyll,What makes a duke of Baldur's Gate so interesting to the drow? Even the houses of Menzoberranzan would have little use for my father.
Wyll,I've been asking myself the same question.
Wyll,"And there is. I would tell you more, but - I can't. That must be the end of it."
Wyll,And there is. I want to tell you but I - I can't. The pact forbids it.
Wyll,"He made me an exile. That said, I'm not about to let him suffer at the hands of his captors."
Wyll,I can't tell you more - the pact forbids it. My lips are quite literally sealed.
Wyll,I was close to him once. Until he disowned me and cast me out of Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,"More than worried, in truth."
Wyll,Thank you. That means a lot. But I wonder -
Wyll,Florrick spoke true. I'm a Grand Duke's son.
Wyll,Father's words. Hard to argue with them.
Wyll,"'You can put distance between you and yesterday, but you'll never leave it fully behind.'"
Wyll,"Because our relation was no matter of pride, not least for him."
Wyll,So why am I frozen in doubt? Tell me it was right to strike her down.
Wyll,The Blade of Frontiers. A man hunting the fiends who prey on the weak and claw at the Coast.
Wyll,And Wyll Ravengard. A memory of a memory. A man who belongs to the past.
Wyll,"When I look into a mirror, I see two faces."
Wyll,I see the Blade of Frontiers. A man hunting the fiends who prey on the weak and claw at the Coast.
Wyll,Courage and confidence. You would have made a fine son to my father.
Wyll,There is. But I can't tell you more - the pact forbids it.
Wyll,There is. And you know why I can't tell you. My lips are quite literally sealed.
Wyll,No - this can't be his end. Father's vanquished dragon cultists and assassins alike with his own bastard sword. A Ravengard is not ruined by fire nor blood.
Wyll,Hells. He may have made me an exile. But he didn't deserve to be abandoned to the flames.
Wyll,"I should have said sooner, I know. But it's a complicated matter."
Wyll,My heart aches to think of it.
Wyll,"You weren't to know. I should have said sooner, but it's a complicated matter."
Wyll,Hells. He may have made me an exile. But my heart aches to think we abandoned him to the flames.
Wyll,I was close to my father once. Until he disowned me and cast me out of Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,Courage and confidence. You would have made a fine child to my father.
Wyll,In a manner of speaking. Duke Ravengard is my father.
Wyll,The inn has long burned to the ground. We'd more easily pull a rainbow from the sky.
Wyll,Shit. Shit. Shit!
Wyll,Dammit it all to the Hells. We left Waukeen's Rest to burn - and Grand Duke Ravengard to burn along with it.
Wyll,Such a rift isn't so easily mended. But it's not so wide that I'd let my own father suffer at his captor's hands.
Wyll,"My father and I were close, once upon a time. Until he disowned me and cast me out of Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,Just the one - yours truly.
Wyll,You heard right.
Wyll,"Put plainly, I'm not about to let these drow go unpunished for taking my father."
Wyll,I'm all for it.
Wyll,And I see Wyll Ravengard. A memory of a memory. A man who belongs to the past.
Wyll,You need to understand - Duke Ravengard is my father.
Wyll,"If it is a story worth telling, then it is a life worth living."
Wyll,Maybe one day he'll see the truth of it.
Wyll,Heh. And I went and proved him right.
Wyll,"It's been seven years since I left. It's no paradise - but it's home, and it's worth saving."
Wyll,A shame that Gortash would abandon the spirit of hospitality that made it so special.
Wyll,"It's where my father taught me to hold a rapier, to read the books of law... to know right from wrong..."
Wyll,It's where the Flaming Fist chased me after I'd stolen a peach from a cart in the Wide. I got a good chewing out over it too.
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate is where I first raised a glass in toast at the tender age of fourteen - and got so tipsy from wine, I puked in Dillard Portyr's bushes."
Wyll,It's because you know the heart lurking under the horns.
Wyll,The people will see a curiosity. Maybe even a beast hungry for their souls.
Wyll,"Then I'll fight ever harder, be ever stronger, 'til my deeds eclipse my appearance."
Wyll,"I suppose I'll grow used to the new me, horns and all."
Wyll,Heh. I can't tell if you're being silly or serious. I'll accept the flattery either way.
Wyll,Be my mirror. What do you see?
Wyll,But I haven't seen my reflection just yet.
Wyll,Not to mention a few bumps and prongs in unmentionable places.
Wyll,"Friend, be my mirror. What do you see?"
Wyll,Though I'll have to take your word for it. I've been avoiding my own reflection.
Wyll,"Character, you say? Well, who couldn't use a bit more of that?"
Wyll,"I feel the weight of these horns on my head, curling upwards like a mammoth's tusks. I feel these ridges snaking down my neck."
Wyll,"It's said that anyone who bathes in the River of Blood emerges as one born anew. It's a lot like that, I imagine."
Wyll,I was hoping you would. It's been on my mind.
Wyll,I want to talk about what happened. About your... affliction.
Wyll,I was hunting near the Cloakwood when I heard it - a child crying out from a lone farmstead.
Wyll,"And you? The Gate's your city too, after all. How's it feel to be back?"
Wyll,"It makes me angry to think about, still."
Wyll,"Wonderful, isn't it? Toril's history is written within our city's walls."
Wyll,Voices raised in song on Returning Day; the heady wines at the Elfsong. There's truly no place like Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,I will return to Avernus. And I'll cut Mizora to ribbons before she can so much as groan Zariel's name.
Wyll,I can't let it go.
Wyll,You're right - I need to forget Mizora. The people of the Coast call to the Blade. I can't let myself stray from them.
Wyll,"You're right - I won't target Mizora. But should she cross my path in Avernus, I'll cut her to ribbons before she can so much as groan Zariel's name."
Wyll,But I can't. Not when I know I'm killing her out of revenge.
Wyll,Part of me wants to argue. To insist that I'd be killing Mizora for the good of the Coast.
Wyll,Damn right. I'll cut her to ribbons before she can so much as groan Zariel's name.
Wyll,Father trained me in the sword and the bow. They'll have to sustain me.
Wyll,"I won't let her claim one more soul, slay one more victim. I'm going to make my way to the Hells and tear the horns right off her damned head."
Wyll,I will be hunting Mizora.
Wyll,*Sigh* Yes. There is.
Wyll,"Ah, but enough reflection for today. I'm of a mind to celebrate."
Wyll,"The four pillars finally rise within me. Courage, Insight, strategy, justice."
Wyll,"An old name, for certain. But a new man to bear it."
Wyll,And this I promise: you can always look to me.
Wyll,But I also know you can find light if you know where to look.
Wyll,No one knows better than I do the deep shadows haunting Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,Deep shadows have long haunted Baldur's Gate - and few loom so large as Cazador's.
Wyll,"The ghosts of the past have long haunted Baldur's Gate, Shadowheart. No one knows this better than you."
Wyll,The city can be... pungent. But it's much more than that. Toril's history is written within Baldur's Gate's walls.
Wyll,Give it time. It's a city of many colours; let them wash over you.
Wyll,Expeditions to the continent of Maztica gather in the harbour. The Church of Gond displays its most priceless treasures in the High House of Wonders.
Wyll,Tell that to the boy shivering over his mother's ravaged corpse.
Wyll,"I mourn the ones I could never save, whose cries I never heard."
Wyll,"I left him with his uncles. Five years on, and he's flourishing. If only every child were so lucky."
Wyll,"In the boy's tears, I finally saw the suffering wrought by the villains of the wild."
Wyll,"But what of the others? The children never saved, the cries never heard?"
Wyll,"No. But he named me friend, and that meant the world."
Wyll,Angry at myself that it took so long for me to see the Coast's suffering.
Wyll,"Angry at the monsters preying on innocents. Angry at the so-called good gods, for tolerating the cruelty of the evil."
Wyll,I don't remember much of the battle. But I remember drying the boy's tears after.
Wyll,"I found him in the fields, flanked by goblins. His mother's corpse bled into the soil next to him."
Wyll,"After my exile, I was hunting near the Cloakwood. I heard a child crying out from a lone farmstead."
Wyll,So it was for me.
Wyll,"My father once said, 'One does not pursue a champion's life. One merely answers its call.'"
Wyll,"A most vicious one, in fact."
Wyll,"I'm not about to make such a sacrifice - not now, not ever."
Wyll,No. This is one offer I won't be taking.
Wyll,Very well. I will avail myself of the Astral tadpole's powers.
Wyll,The Coast is ever my priority. If you think we need this -
Wyll,"Gods, yes. I can feel its energy, its essence filling me to near-bursting."
Wyll,"I won't begrudge you your choice. As for me, though - I'm not ready. I might never be."
Wyll,Yes. And at a great cost - partial ceremorphosis.
Wyll,What in the Hells? Oh shit - you're a gods-damned vampire?
Wyll,"I know how it goes with vampires and their spawn, Astarion. You can no more deny your hunger than a cat can deny its curiosity."
Wyll,Now that's a pact I can get fully behind.
Wyll,The frontiers demanded a blade. And so I heeded.
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate, born and raised. The only son of a single father."
Wyll,He wanted one life for me; I chose another. We haven't spoken since I left the city.
Wyll,"A classic drama, a staunch father and his rebellious son. Better heard from the bards' lips than mine."
Wyll,"With you as my ally, the future looks a little less daunting."
Wyll,Having a worm wriggling in my skull didn't instil much confidence in the days ahead.
Wyll,And it's nice to meet someone of your talents.
Wyll,You disavowed me of that notion soon enough.
Wyll,I thought you were an archdevil's servant come to bathe the frontiers in flame.
Wyll,Not every threat to Faerûn resides there. Better to prevent a catastrophe than to face it. Even if it means a Hellhunt.
Wyll,"Keep out of my mind. I told you - the eye's a rock, nothing more. "
Wyll,"Keep out of my mind. I told you - the eye's a rock, nothing more. And that's the end of it."
Wyll,What are you...
Wyll,"A - sending stone? Nothing so special, I assure you."
Wyll,I scout both the Hells and the Coast's havens. And I destroy every fiend that dares put its eye on Faerûn.
Wyll,"Ah, but that is a story reserved for lifetime friends and calmer days."
Wyll,It was an even bloodier day and a stronger foe.
Wyll,"The helpless, though - they need the light of others. They're the ones who seek out the Blade."
Wyll,"I shouldn't be surprised. You are a great talent - when darkness falls, you make your own light."
Wyll,"I can only leave the rest to your imagination. Suffice to say, I hunt monsters - devils included. And I will do what I can to quench the Coast of their flames."
Wyll,You are a warlock. You know about bound souls and frozen tongues.
Wyll,A powerful friend with a keen interest in... privacy. I'm sworn to say no more.
Wyll,"I can't bear to imagine the lives Karlach might be taking, the damage she might be doing."
Wyll,She fled from my reach - even climbed aboard the mind flayer ship as it screeched through the Hells. I followed in close pursuit.
Wyll,"One of the archdevil Zariel's own - chaos incarnate, a devil with pure fire for a heart. I made my way to Avernus to stop her."
Wyll,"Karlach's fires raged in Baldur's Gate before she escaped to Avernus, as my source told it - and she was planning to return."
Wyll,"It's made from pure Bloodstone, carved from the Galena Mountains just north of the Moonsea. A reminder that sometimes, blood must be shed and sacrifices must be made."
Wyll,"I do what I do best. Answering the calls of the needful, killing the monsters that haunt them -"
Wyll,- and showing them they won't be abandoned.
Wyll,"I love the Coast, I love its people. The Blade of Avernus will toil for them..."
Wyll,"Not just a boy - a Ravengard, schooled in the four pillars: Courage, insight, strategy, justice."
Wyll,To conjure the Dragon Queen and lay waste to Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,"Another time, then. I'll hold nothing back."
Wyll,I understand.
Wyll,"After, he said only one word: 'Go.' So I did."
Wyll,I showed him my stone eye - but he only turned away.
Wyll,"I tried to tell him the truth, but my mouth couldn't form the words. I led him to the battlefield, but Mizora had swept it clean."
Wyll,He returned to an unsuspecting city and a wayward son with a smirking devil at his side.
Wyll,Mizora replaced it with a sending stone. She uses it to track my location and speak from a distance.
Wyll,"I could flee to the Spine of the World or the depths of the Lowerdark, and still never shake her."
Wyll,"You were right, of course - the new eye is a sending stone, courtesy of Mizora. She uses it to track my location and call from a distance."
Wyll,It is. The one scar I ever bore of it.
Wyll,My soul was bound and my lips were sealed.
Wyll,"The cultists choked on our poisons and burned from our flames. When we were done, all that remained were five greyed orbs atop a pile of ash."
Wyll,I burned with the fires of Avernus and oozed the rot of Dis.
Wyll,I had Mizora at my side - and the archdevil Zariel guided our hands that day.
Wyll,"The moment I agreed, I burned with the fires of Avernus and oozed the rot of Dis."
Wyll,Another pet added to her warlock menagerie.
Wyll,Tiamat made a play for power. Zariel had other plans. That's the most Mizora's ever said - all that mattered was that she got her prize:
Wyll,She didn't - she came on order of her mistress Zariel.
Wyll,She read the terms while two devils stood witness. And I said yes. One soul for one city.
Wyll,Then you know loyalty. And you know I did what had to be done.
Wyll,Fiercely loyal to your people. Then you'll understand that I did what had to be done.
Wyll,She came on orders of her mistress Zariel.
Wyll,"But I've got only six months before I'm made a free man, thanks be to the Triad."
Wyll,Resentment is a poison on one's heart. The only way to avoid damage is to pour it out.
Wyll,"The better question is: Does he miss me? If he does, he misses the Wyll Ravengard he once knew, not the helltouched warlock he returned to."
Wyll,"The better question is: Did he ever miss me? If he did, he missed the Wyll Ravengard he once knew, not the helltouched warlock he returned to."
Wyll,More than you know.
Wyll,And Grand Duke Ravengard suffers neither.
Wyll,"He did the only thing he could. In his eyes, I invited a devil into our midst. I was a fool at best; a traitor at worst."
Wyll,"No, never."
Wyll,"If you remember, I'd heard a whisper in the night directing me to Dusthawk Hill. That's where I found the cultists, joined in ritual prayer."
Wyll,But I'd only tell you that if you were wrong. This is the hand I was dealt. I need to make the most of it.
Wyll,"I should be telling you to find your mettle. Have a little faith, push against the raging winds. That sort of thing."
Wyll,'She will destroy Baldur's Gate. Grant me your soul - and I will give you the power to save it.'
Wyll,"What was it father said? 'Fear is what you feel, courage is what you do.'"
Wyll,"Once you're stuck to a devil, they're hard to brush off. But you - you make me think I still have a chance."
Wyll,You're positively brimming with confidence. Mind if I borrow a handful?
Wyll,"Godsdamnit, I'll never be rid of her. The more I want to shake her leash, the tighter she pulls it."
Wyll,"I have my father's training, I have cunning, I have my wits. And they'll have to do."
Wyll,The Blade of Frontiers is fuelled by more than Avernus' flames.
Wyll,"All I have to do is stay alive. That should be easy enough, with someone of your skill at my side."
Wyll,I can't imagine how. The pact binds her as tightly as it binds me.
Wyll,"The Coast needs the Blade, and I have no intention of turning my back on it."
Wyll,"These infernal talents are useful, I admit. Once they're gone, I'll have to rely my wits and my training. They'll have to do."
Wyll,"First, we kill Ketheric Thorm. Then I'll tell you everything you want to know."
Wyll,"I have my father's training, I have cunning, I have my wits. If I ever manage to break this pact, they'll more than do."
Wyll,"A Grand Duke's duty is to his city, first and foremost. There would only ever be one outcome."
Wyll,"That's when I felt Mizora's lips against my ear, and heard that same canny whisper."
Wyll,There was a crack of thunder and a gust of wind. A storm descended -
Wyll,Works for me. First we get to the killing. Then we get to the planning.
Wyll,Ah - the 'cross that bridge when we come to it' approach.
Wyll,"A shining star, beckoning them to a brilliant future."
Wyll,"You make me so proud. And when the elder brain falls, the people of Baldur's Gate will see what I see:"
Wyll,Then let it be so. Could any man have wanted a partner more ravishing?
Wyll,And you? You'll be the Duke's consort. That is - if your heart so desires.
Wyll,I'll guide the city to a better future. Baldur's Gate will again be the Jewel of the Coast.
Wyll,Sure.
Wyll,"Then we open the gates to refugees, restore diplomatic ties. Baldur's Gate will again be the Jewel of the Coast."
Wyll,"Next, we heal the city. We restore our broken buildings, stone by stone. We restore faith in each other, one good turn at a time."
Wyll,"First, we mourn. We bow our heads for the fallen, and honour them by pledging peace."
Wyll,"If I'm to be a Grand Duke, I've got to greet the people and gain their trust."
Wyll,"Let's hope Gale doesn't take offence if I assume cooking duties, just the once."
Wyll,Forget the curtsy. I'd rather share a cheap brown ale and a hunk of fresh venison. You in?
Wyll,'The Blade of Avernus.' A new name for a changed man.
Wyll,'The Blade of Frontiers.' An old name for a new man.
Wyll,... but Wyll Ravengard belongs to you.
Wyll,"I love the Coast, I love its people. The Blade of Frontiers belongs to them..."
Wyll,"You make me so proud. And when the elder brain falls, the people of the Sword Coast will see what I see:"
Wyll,Faerûn doesn't need just one hero. It needs two. Say you'll fight with me.
Wyll,... but he'd rather not toil alone.
Wyll,"Well. If our love must be a ghost, I won't fool myself into grasping for it."
Wyll,"But if I can't call you 'partner', I'm glad I can still call you 'friend'."
Wyll,"Of course. But we need nourishment, don't we? We can't go beating up brains on empty stomachs."
Wyll,"If you think I need a reminder she's holding my chains, think again. But that won't keep me from enjoying one festal meal, devil-free."
Wyll,"Around each totem, five robed figures were chanting. First softly, then loud as a banshee's wail."
Wyll,Below the mount I saw five totems with dragon heads carved on top. Each head held a massive orb in its jaws.
Wyll,I'll paint the clearest picture I can.
Wyll,"There they were, gathered at the foot of the Hill."
Wyll,"I grabbed a rapier and set out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky, yet not a single star was shining."
Wyll,"A tenday after father left, I heard a whisper as I slept. 'Dusthawk Hill. The Queen of Chaos awakens. Go alone.' "
Wyll,"A religion devoted to conjuring the most evil of goddesses, the dragon Tiamat."
Wyll,That's when the Cult of the Dragon made its move.
Wyll,"Yes - my father is a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate, and I am his only son."
Wyll,"I was seventeen. Father - Ulder Ravengard - had just been named a Grand Duke, and was called away to Elturel to help settle a dispute."
Wyll,- and one of Tiamat's five heads appeared from within it.
Wyll,I could never be so disloyal to Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,As would I - and more.
Wyll,"Yes. But first, a question. If your home were under siege, what would you sacrifice to save it?"
Wyll,"First, we kill Ketheric Thorm. Then, I'll tell you everything you want to know."
Wyll,'Unhappy' doesn't begin to describe it.
Wyll,"A hearty meal would do the trick. A few hunks of fresh venison, a round of brown ale - what do you say?"
Wyll,"Ah, there you are! I was thinking - I'm not Grand Duke just yet, but I'm still of a mind to celebrate."
Wyll,Forget the bowing. I'd rather share a cheap brown ale and a hunk of fresh venison. You in?
Wyll,"Neither, brave Boo! How about we share a cheap brown ale and a hunk of fresh venison instead?"
Wyll,"Ah, too bad. Maybe you'll go changing your mind, once I've hunted some deer and scrounged up the ale."
Wyll,"But let's leave those matters to the future. Right now, I've got a hankering for some gourmet grub."
Wyll,It is. And I did.
Wyll,"'Nothing more?' Ah, but to be friends with you is no compromise - it is an achievement unto itself."
Wyll,We aren't 'just' friends. We are friends. No qualifications and no apologies needed.
Wyll,"A little, perhaps."
Wyll,Gods - have we really cut down the Great Ranger Minsc? A nightmare that can never be erased from my memory.
Wyll,It worries me too.
Wyll,"I see the hunger in your eyes, and I see how it worries you."
Wyll,"Githyanki are impressive - cold as ice, when they're not blazing hot. I wager Lae'zel's no exception."
Wyll,All right. Far be it from me not to take you at your word.
Wyll,Consume all the magic artefacts you need to keep that bomb of yours from exploding.
Wyll,Hm. Really?
Wyll,"Not that I'm one to question someone's meal preferences, but something tells me this is more than a dietary quirk."
Wyll,You slurped that thing up like a horse with a carrot.
Wyll,"Minsc, the great ranger. He's alive - and infected? Hells. We need to act."
Wyll,"Damned goblins. Monsters, every last one - the kind I was culling from Sword Coast hamlets just a tenday ago."
Wyll,"Thousands were sacrificed, and the servant become lord. I am sure Astarion's quite pleased with himself."
Wyll,"Thousands were sacrificed, and the servant become lord. I am sure you're quite pleased with yourself."
Wyll,Hells - you are Bhaalspawn. It explains so much.
Wyll,"Today, a sacrifice must be made. I trust in you to lead us down the right path."
Wyll,Or maybe he made an offer she couldn't refuse.
Wyll,Maybe it's true. Maybe Stelmane allied with a mind flayer and subjected the city to their political will.
Wyll,Mind flayers are like devils - they just sport tentacles rather than wings.
Wyll,"Hm. If there is, I'm not aware of it."
Wyll,"What, though... I couldn't say."
Wyll,It could just be my imagination. But I always felt that it was more than a stroke that had changed her.
Wyll,"Erm - as glad as I am to have the hammer, I'm not so sure a devil's deal was the way to go here."
Wyll,"But that second time, her gaze never left me. It was steel, sharp and unyielding."
Wyll,"'I hope you know what you're doing' would be the trite thing to say here, but... it suits the occasion."
Wyll,But we've got to tread carefully. I won't risk my father's life to take Gortash's.
Wyll,"Raphael thought he could outsmart us - but there are other ways to get the Orphic Hammer, guaranteed."
Wyll,"Hold close to the light, and keep the shadows at bay."
Wyll,"Gods, poor Zevlor - even good intentions can lead us down deadly paths."
Wyll,"I wish I knew a good githyanki cheer to celebrate the occasion, but the only gith phrases I've picked up are the sweary sort."
Wyll,"But Lae'zel said it anyway, to her immense credit. She's choosing truth, she's choosing freedom - for her, for Orpheus, for the githyanki people."
Wyll,"But you said it anyway, to your immense credit. You're choosing truth, you're choosing freedom - for you, for Orpheus, for your people."
Wyll,Vlaakith's a fearsome one. The sort it's hard to say 'no' to.
Wyll,I hope that's the end of this silly quarrel. They'll have no energy for battling our enemies if Lae'zel and Shadowheart are too busy squabbling among themselves.
Wyll,"Incredible to be back. My home, my city."
Wyll,"An anti-lantern that radiates darkness and not light? Clever idea. Unnerving, too."
Wyll,Jaheira would do anything to see her family safe. They're lucky to have her - and she's lucky to have them.
Wyll,"Raphael's good and gone - feels damn good, too. Now if only I could get rid of the other devil in my life..."
Wyll,"Dammit all, we've got to get Lae'zel back. If that means killing Gortash, nothing would give me greater pleasure."
Wyll,"Such soothing light here, as if Selûne herself was caressing my skin."
Wyll,"The source of Gortash's Watchers. If I could get over my disgust, I might be impressed."
Wyll,The gith knight is as merciless as the dragon he rides. That we still have our heads is nothing short of a miracle.
Wyll,Hero's work.
Wyll,"Unfettered slaughter, no more and no less. I thought better of you. That was my mistake."
Wyll,"A veritable angel, chained and tortured for centuries. To think she was so close to freedom."
Wyll,Bhaal's chosen has been bled. May her torment be tenfold of that which she inflicted.
Wyll,"An impostor in our camp? We must identify them - and quickly. Without trust, our fellowship is doomed to wither and die."
Wyll,"Dammit all, we've got to get Halsin back. If that means killing Gortash, nothing would give me greater pleasure."
Wyll,Something's always gnawed at me.
Wyll,Her death is no blessing - it is a calculated cruelty. Think about it:
Wyll,Nonsense. Stelmane was no less worthy of life or success because she was disabled.
Wyll,"I will be his champion, I will be his pride. I will be the man he taught me to be."
Wyll,A duke's son is forever blessed and cursed to carry his banner.
Wyll,Expectation.
Wyll,"When I left the city, my father saw only a boy carrying the stench of the Hells. Now, he sees the man I made of myself."
Wyll,My last seven years have been defined by the secrets I carried. I feel light as a feather now that I've shed them.
Wyll,Relief.
Wyll,"- I could once more call Baldur's Gate home. Whether I return there, well... only time will tell."
Wyll,"Once all this is ended, once we've crushed the brain and freed the people -"
Wyll,A shame that man must forever wear a devil's face.
Wyll,"To my father, I was only ever a boy. Incredible, that he can see the man I became."
Wyll,It's a flurry of emotion. I'm not sure how to make sense of it.
Wyll,"It's complicated. There's the joy of reconciliation, the relief of forgiveness - and the anxiety of new expectation."
Wyll,"We can't and we won't, Ketheric Thorm be damned."
Wyll,"We can't and we won't, the shadows be damned."
Wyll,"With a parasite in his head, the city's guardian would be its ruin - unless we put a stop to it.<br>"
Wyll,"But if I'm not, the city's guardian will be its ruin - unless we put a stop to it."
Wyll,As for infection... I fear you might be right.
Wyll,"If they wanted him dead, they would've fed him to the flames at Waukeen's Rest."
Wyll,They will infect him. And the city's guardian will become its ruin - unless we put a stop to it.
Wyll,"But if I'm right, they will infect him. And the city's guardian will become its ruin - unless we put a stop to it."
Wyll,"Me too, Shadowheart. Me too."
Wyll,She might still be alive if we'd just spoken up...
Wyll,She might still be alive if we'd struck Kagha first...
Wyll,An unbearable tragedy.
Wyll,Kagha's sort of evil is more terrible than most. She worships sheer cruelty and dares to call it justice.
Wyll,Not a tragedy - a calculated cruelty. Think about it:
Wyll,These murders aren't random acts. Someone powerful is guiding the killer's hand. And the city is made weaker for it.
Wyll,"'To exert control, you must first sow chaos.' A tyrant's strategy, as father would say."
Wyll,"My father was tadpoled. Stelmane is dead. The people are frightened, and the Council's in disarray."
Wyll,I couldn't say. But think about this:
Wyll,"Whatever you believe about Stelmane, she's not the only one to suffer the killer's blow."
Wyll,"Gods, what I wouldn't give to drive a dagger through the Emperor's bulging head."
Wyll,"Not a mere stroke, as it turns out - but the scars of her possession."
Wyll,"Even with the aid of a cane, each step she took was a struggle. Every word she spoke took great physical effort."
Wyll,"The second time, Stelmane was - different."
Wyll,"We know he keeps it in the House of Hope. If we can find a diabolist, they could help us make our way in."
Wyll,Chestnut hair that flowed behind her like willow fronds. She floated from one room to the next as if carried by clouds.
Wyll,I met her twice.
Wyll,Words of evil masked as justice. Sickening.
Wyll,"Ah yes, that old refrain. 'If only she'd obeyed.'"
Wyll,What we saw was an atrocity. There's blood on Kagha's hands - enough to dye the Chionthar red.
Wyll,I'm supposed to believe you've acquired every trinket you're carrying through legal means?
Wyll,There's blood on Kagha's hands - enough to dye the Chionthar red.
Wyll,"An accident? She may not have sprung the trap, but she still set it."
Wyll,Her sort of evil is more terrible than most. She worships sheer cruelty and dares to call it justice.
Wyll,You'd turn a blind eye to this outrage? You're vicious as Kagha.
Wyll,Fate didn't kill this child. Kagha did.
Wyll,"The first time, I was a boy of seven or eight, at a banquet in the Flaming Fist's honour. One look and I was smitten."
Wyll,"Welcome to the Lower City, where Baldur's Gate truly comes alive."
Wyll,"Astarion has a certain swagger, don't you find? An interesting fellow. Nice hair, to boot."
Wyll,"Defile Vlaakith's name, and even a gith knight can't avoid the wrath of the mighty Lae'zel."
Wyll,"And how terrible, to know your time to enjoy it is so short."
Wyll,"How beautiful it must be, to know you can hold a hand, to caress a cheek, after going so long without."
Wyll,"Graven idols, cindered air. Bhaal's bloodied hands moulded this place."
Wyll,"Its light holds off every shadow. Keep close to the creature, lest the shadows devour us."
Wyll,"Understandable. Every tale was more sensational than the last. With a narrator so unreliable, how do we tell fact from fiction?"
Wyll,"Ah, yes - Gith's only son, locked away in his astral prison for defying Vlaakith."
Wyll,"It holds our fates in its talons. Until the Absolute falls, there's no getting rid of it."
Wyll,I can't pretend I have the answer. But I know the illithid's right about one thing:
Wyll,"Sensational tales, aren't they? Almost unbelievable. With a narrator so unreliable, how do we tell fact from fiction?"
Wyll,"How could I forget? One of Baldur's Gate's most distinguished figures, a mind flayer's ally."
Wyll,"Ah yes - the wayward prince, locked away by the queen who would wield his power."
Wyll,Did I miss anything?
Wyll,Three: The mind flayer's been siphoning a githyanki prisoner's powers to shield us from the Absolute's voice.
Wyll,"Two: It's been appearing as someone else in our dreams, cajoling us to embrace our new illithid talents."
Wyll,One: We've been carrying a mind flayer around with us this whole time.
Wyll,"By Balduran's bones, this is a lot to take in. Let's see if I've got this right:"
Wyll,They may never again feel the breathe of life on them. What a shame.
Wyll,And it seems Mystra's offered you an equally explosive solution. A shame my first brush with the famed Elminster couldn't be a tad more... optimistic.
Wyll,"The seed of tyranny begins with the want for power. Nurture it, let it grow, and we become the very despots we once despised."
Wyll,"Power. Is that not what it is always about? Ketheric, Gortash, and now Viconia."
Wyll,"Too dangerous, even, for Mystra. But I would sooner trust it with a god than a man."
Wyll,"Karlach, I'm so sorry."
Wyll,"If that wizard wants Dame Aylin so bad, I say we give him exactly what he's asked for."
Wyll,I'd love nothing more than to see her grind that wretch into bonedust.
Wyll,Father taught me to come to terms with my mortality. Mizora forced me to come to terms with a hellish fate.
Wyll,Onward - we cannot let the Nightsong do battle alone!
Wyll,I trust that's the end of this silly quarrel? We'll have no energy for battling our enemies if we're too busy squabbling among ourselves.
Wyll,"So Astarion's gone for good. I'll miss his - well, let's call it 'charisma'."
Wyll,I hope he'll come to see that.
Wyll,"Big bomb be damned, Gale's got everything he needs to defeat the Absolute already: Talent, nerve, and powerful allies at his side."
Wyll,"Listen - I might invoke the Triad from time to time, appeal to Helm. But I'm no man of faith. Not like Gale."
Wyll,And it seems Mystra's offered him an equally explosive solution. A shame our first brush with the famed Elminster couldn't be a tad more... optimistic.
Wyll,Quite an explosive secret for Gale to keep to himself.
Wyll,"The shadows are lifted. Finally, we can breathe free."
Wyll,I hope you can come to terms with your choice. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to.
Wyll,This crown seems too powerful and dangerous an object for mere mortals to possess.
Wyll,"A cruel fate, and for what? An unreliable ally in Viconia? Or just for the sheer cruelty of it?"
Wyll,So you went through with it. You returned Shadowheart to Viconia.
Wyll,Shar called Shadowheart 'nothing.' But I know better than that.
Wyll,Shar called you 'nothing.' But I know better than that.
Wyll,The githyanki curing device seems set on killing us instead. I really had hoped...
Wyll,"If she points a blade at one of us again, don't hesitate to strike. We can afford no more unrest among us, not if we're to survive long enough to rid ourselves of these worms."
Wyll,"Careful who you point your blade at next. We can afford no more unrest among us, not if we're to survive long enough to rid ourselves of these worms."
Wyll,Lae'zel is a powderkeg - and Shadowheart was the spark.
Wyll,You are a powderkeg - and Shadowheart was the spark.
Wyll,"I don't envy you. But for what it's worth, I'm still at your side. And for now, I'm not going anywhere."
Wyll,But to be destined for madness? I don't know if I could ever make peace with it.
Wyll,"Her mind will be wiped, and Viconia will remake her in whatever image she desires."
Wyll,Who better than the commander of the Flaming Fist to dismantle its defences?
Wyll,The Undercity. Father always warned me not to go poking around here - and for very good reason.
Wyll,"Damn it all, the spawn got exactly what they came for. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to fight back."
Wyll,"But - if Karlach wants to go make these last moments count, then don't hold her back."
Wyll,"But if assimilation is your choice, I won't stop you. I never would."
Wyll,"We can break him free. He might give us options we hadn't thought of, opened doors that we thought were closed."
Wyll,But there's another option to consider: Orpheus.
Wyll,Death is staring her down. And she want these last moments to count for something.
Wyll,Death is staring you down. And so you want these last moments to count for something.
Wyll,Karlach never ceases to amaze me.
Wyll,You never cease to amaze me.
Wyll,"If I had a bottle of Dragondew, I'd open it in your honour."
Wyll,"You have conquered your urge, you have taken back your own soul. I'm so proud of you."
Wyll,I made a mistake. This is your chance to learn from it.
Wyll,"Refuse him, no matter how tempting the offer, no matter how delicious the feast he lays out for you. The cost's always too great."
Wyll,'The Devil with the Silver Tongue.'
Wyll,But her suffering is over - and so is her parents'. I hope she finds comfort in that.
Wyll,"But your suffering is over, Shadowheart - and so is your parents'. I hope you find comfort in that."
Wyll,Shadowheart's memories will be a heavy load for her to carry.
Wyll,"I'm sorry, Shadowheart. This memory will be a heavy load to carry."
Wyll,"This True Soul Nere's stuck behind a rockfall, is he? Forgive me if I'm in no hurry to go digging him out."
Wyll,Our very own vampire's the missing pawn in his master's deadly game.
Wyll,I thought she was exaggerating. And I was wrong.
Wyll,"The Plane of Shadow. My tutor called it a dark mirror held up to our own plane of existence, a perversion of all we hold dear."
Wyll,"Kill a hellbeast, unveil the truth. Raphael may be a scoundrel, but it's too good a deal to refuse."
Wyll,"Ketheric Thorm is no more. And may he stay dead, this time."
Wyll,"Breathe, focus. This battle's barely begun."
Wyll,"A good wizard is hard to find. Let's make Gale feel welcome, as best we can."
Wyll,Sounds good to me.
Wyll,"Then we'd do well to walk around it. Use these powers sparingly, if you must use them at all."
Wyll,"Very well. If it's mind games these parasites wish to play, we'll play. And we'll win."
Wyll,These powers could be enough to edge us towards victory.
Wyll,And yet... I can't help recall the words of my father. 'The best plan is the one that works.'
Wyll,"At first I thought we should avoid these 'gifts', no matter what advantage we gain."
Wyll,"It gave me a tadpole gift, too. Just like it did the first time it appeared. I suppose it hoped this would help."
Wyll,"I had another dream last night. The visitor came to me, and ordered me to penetrate the heart of the very cult that's spreading the infection."
Wyll,"Shar's domain, indeed. Despair and discarded memories, lurking in every shadow."
Wyll,But I think Jaheira's got the right idea. Better I live fully and meaningfully than to pine for an always-and-forever I could never achieve.
Wyll,Get your gear in order and rest up. We've got an undead elf to go recue.
Wyll,"You githyanki live for this very ideal, yes? To be welcomed home and live eternally in the Astral."
Wyll,"I bet Shadowheart's still wondering if she did the right thing. As for me, I haven't a shadow of a doubt."
Wyll,"I bet you're still wondering if you did the right thing. As for me, I haven't a shadow of a doubt."
Wyll,"I'd pity the man who must bear the rage the Nightsong brings to bear, if that man weren't Ketheric Thorm."
Wyll,"When the light shone through, I hoped she'd follow it."
Wyll,"When the light shone through, I hoped you'd follow it."
Wyll,So our half-elf ally's heart belongs to the shadows after all.
Wyll,So your heart belongs eternally to the shadows after all.
Wyll,Astarion showed restraint where most others wouldn't. He might not appreciate the sentiment - but I'm proud of him.
Wyll,You showed restraint where most others wouldn't. This might not mean much - but I'm proud of you.
Wyll,I've rarely had to venture this far below the surface. Rare is the under-beast that takes to the sun.
Wyll,Who among us hasn't wondered what it would be like to live forever?
Wyll,Who better than Grand Duke Ravengard to surrender it?
Wyll,Father's at Moonrise Towers. And we need to save him.
Wyll,"The counsellor's loyalty to my father is beyond question. She's as steady as Tyr's heartbeat, as upstanding as the Sword Mountains."
Wyll,"Why shouldn't I? I have no reason to doubt Eltan's word, and neither do you."
Wyll,"Why shouldn't I? I have no reason to doubt Florrick's word, and neither do you."
Wyll,"We'll finish what my father couldn't. We'll awaken Ansur, the Heart of the Gate."
Wyll,What matters now is that Florrick saw sense - and we know our path forward.
Wyll,"Curse that rotten devil and her forked tongue, trying to set Florrick against me. She's a damnable inferno of chaos."
Wyll,"And to me. But given who carried it, I think it's more than just a myth."
Wyll,'The Legend of Ansur' isn't just a poem - it's a history.
Wyll,"Why shouldn't I? It must be more than a myth, given who carried it."
Wyll,It's not just a tale. It's a history.
Wyll,"'O Balduran, founder due veneration, his guardian dragon Ansur, tremendous in worth. A saviour below, our eternal elation.'"
Wyll,"The way you looked at Shadowheart, I was so sure you'd fallen."
Wyll,"She has heart, that one. I mean - well, you know what I mean. Take good care of her. And make sure she takes care of you."
Wyll,I hope Karlach makes you happy. You deserve it.
Wyll,"Go - take his hand, write your story. I know you will make it one worth hearing."
Wyll,"I always figured him for a clever one. By falling for you, he proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt."
Wyll,I hope Gale makes you happy. You deserve it.
Wyll,"I was certain you'd stick with Lae'zel. I can't match her intensity, though I think you've already guessed."
Wyll,"Well, er, anything on your mind?"
Wyll,So - what's on your mind?
Wyll,"So we are. Friends, even, if I might say so."
Wyll,What we have is resolute. I wouldn't trade that for all the material plane.
Wyll,I do. And so did my father.
Wyll,'Daddy' held the key to a living weapon that could melt that brain into goo.
Wyll,"Curse that rotten devil and her forked tongue, setting Eltan against me!"
Wyll,We've felled a potential ally - but it's Mizora's hands that are stained with the blood.
Wyll,"Go on, read the Legend of Ansur. Then we can plan our next steps."
Wyll,I do. And so does my father.
Wyll,I disappointed him once. I won't do it again.
Wyll,"Why shouldn't I? I have no reason to doubt my father's word, and neither do you."
Wyll,What matters now is that Eltan saw sense - and we know our path forward.
Wyll,"Curse that rotten devil and her forked tongue, trying to set Eltan against me. She's a damnable inferno of chaos."
Wyll,This dragon Ansur was Balduran's ally. We'd be fools to let him sleep while the Dead Three's chosen raze the city.
Wyll,"Then this: 'With the shock of a true hero's spark flickers, the torches alight! And wyrm's eyes shall awake aglitter.' To open the way, we'll need to spark torches."
Wyll,Consider this: 'To Wyrmway 'neath prison's deepest level.' That must mean Wyrm's Rock prison - that's where we'll find the entrance to this 'Wyrmway'.
Wyll,"Still, I've - entertained the idea. Imagine the evils I could vanquish, the alliances I could build."
Wyll,"But truth is, I'd rather be friends than lovers. Romance is all peaks and valleys, big gains and bigger losses."
Wyll,Heh - I'd sooner end my own life than let Mizora guide Baldur's Gate to ruin.
Wyll,"That presumes, of course, the people would welcome a duke with the face of a devil."
Wyll,"Imagine the evils I could vanquish, the alliances I could build as a Grand Duke."
Wyll,She could try. But I'd sooner end my own life than lead Baldur's Gate to ruin.
Wyll,I've - entertained the idea. I'd sooner end my own life than let Mizora guide Baldur's Gate to ruin.
Wyll,"I am her pathway to power. If I were to become duke, she thinks she'd be calling the shots."
Wyll,Let's talk with Mizora when we camp. I want answers.
Wyll,"What in the Hells was she thinking, to go spewing such treacherous drivel?"
Wyll,"Gods above. If any good's come of this battle, it lies in that legend."
Wyll,We've felled our truest ally in the city - but it's Mizora's hands that are stained with the blood.
Wyll,"Curse that rotten devil and her forked tongue, setting Florrick against me!"
Wyll,Not a matter to take lightly. And not one to be decided today.
Wyll,'Daddy' just gave us the key to a living weapon that could melt that brain into goo.
Wyll,"A bit of talking, a bit of dancing. Nothing too fancy. Just an oasis of normalcy in a world turned on its head."
Wyll,"But what with the tadpoles and towers and abductions and rescues, life had other ideas."
Wyll,Shit - I'm being insensitive. I'm sorry. They just take some getting used to.
Wyll,And to think how much time I've spent wishing I could rip them off.
Wyll,What was it that changed your mind?
Wyll,"I was certain you'd fallen for Karlach, and why wouldn't you? She's got grit, that one."
Wyll,I hope Shadowheart makes you happy. You deserve it.
Wyll,"I've seen that sparkle in your eye, that extra I-don't-know-what. Even a blind derro couldn't miss it."
Wyll,I hope Lae'zel makes you happy. You deserve it.
Wyll,That's it? Well then. So what's on your mind?
Wyll,Look - you're the author of your own story. You get to choose who plays which part.
Wyll,Ouch. A midwinter bath in the Chionthar would have been less chilling.
Wyll,"Ah. Well, you're the author of your own story. You get to choose who plays which part."
Wyll,And what about Astarion?
Wyll,And what about Shadowheart?
Wyll,And what about Lae'zel?
Wyll,And what about Karlach?
Wyll,Really? Oh dear - am I blushing? I feel like I'm blushing.
Wyll,"Thank you, for giving me the chance to show you the best of me. I won't let you down."
Wyll,Really? Oh dear - I swear can feel my horns flushing.
Wyll,And what about Gale?
Wyll,"...well, to hold your hand. To dance with you. To smile coyly, and have you smile back."
Wyll,I'd been letting my mind wander. Wondering what it would be like to...
Wyll,"I'm glad you see my very best self. In the moments I'm any less than that, I hope I'll still find you near."
Wyll,"And we'll have plenty, if I have my way."
Wyll,"Thank you, for seeing the best in me, and showing me the best in you."
Wyll,It was on a whim that I smelled an orchard's sweetest flowers and plucked its sweetest fruit.
Wyll,"Some time back, I'd planned a special evening, just the two of us."
Wyll,"I was certain you'd fallen for Astarion, the charming rapscallion that he is."
Wyll,I don't think I realised just how much you cared for me.
Wyll,You and Gale seemed a match made in the heavens. I'm not half so clever as him. Or is it 'clever as he'?
Wyll,I hope you're happy. I just wish I could have been the one to make you so.
Wyll,I hope Shadowheart makes you happy.
Wyll,I hope Gale makes you happy.
Wyll,I hope Lae'zel makes you happy.
Wyll,I hope Karlach makes you happy.
Wyll,"No more dances, no more touches. But I'm glad, all things considered, I can still call you 'friend'."
Wyll,The thought crossed my mind.
Wyll,"'May the brightest sun always face you, and the pouring rains fall behind.'"
Wyll,I don't resent you for closing the door. But I'm sad I'll never know what's on the other side of it.
Wyll,"It was more than just dancing to me. It was a door to an uncharted world, ours alone to explore."
Wyll,"If friendship is what you're offering, it's an honour to accept."
Wyll,I won't pretend I'm not hurt. But I also won't deny that your friendship alone is a magnificent gift.
Wyll,"- but do me a favour, and make sure it's one worth telling."
Wyll,Don't. You're the author of your own story. I wish I got to play a bigger role in it -
Wyll,I hope Astarion makes you happy.
Wyll,"One of my eyes might be made of stone, but that doesn't mean I'm blind to the obvious."
Wyll,I couldn't want for a better answer.
Wyll,"If we can find such pleasures in each other, our time together is well spent."
Wyll,"That's it, then - not even a single parting word? Then at least let me offer some to you:"
Wyll,"After your little sundown antics, I'm not sure I'm buying what you're selling."
Wyll,"Go on, read the Legend of Ansur. Unless you're too busy dreaming up new insults, in which case, let me save you some time:"
Wyll,Hm. That should cover it.
Wyll,"A devil wouldn't bargain if he thought there was no chance of success, Lae'zel."
Wyll,So you say.
Wyll,"I had but one road I could travel. For now, you have a dozen, a hundred, a thousand even to choose from. A road that leads to a devil is the very last one you should follow."
Wyll,Ahem. You know I can't say more. But I can say this:
Wyll,"I didn't, and I couldn't. My soul was a necessary price to pay for... hrm-hrh..."
Wyll,"Take a single step towards him, and he'll dog you the whole journey."
Wyll,"That's because you still have hope. But when he becomes your last hope, remember this."
Wyll,"Refuse him, no matter how tempting the offer, no matter how delicious the feast he lays out for you. The cost will be too great."
Wyll,"We can learn a lot from fairy tales, don't you think?"
Wyll,"The farmer's dearest fruit, naturally, was no apple nor peach, but his beloved daughter."
Wyll,"A farmer made a deal with a devil, so the story goes: in exchange for the farmer's dearest fruit, the devil granted him a bottomless coinpurse."
Wyll,"An old fairy tale my father read to me. The kind with a hero, a villain, and a moral."
Wyll,He brings to mind a story. 'The Devil with the Silver Tongue.'
Wyll,Or so I thought - until Karlach.
Wyll,"But I promise you, every thrust of my blade and every flame I sparked was for the good of the Coast."
Wyll,"Before I was infected, I could even call hellbeasts and summon festering clouds."
Wyll,It's Mizora who grants me the power to conjure armour and cast eldritch blasts.
Wyll,"Though to hear her tell it, it was my choice to keep her a secret."
Wyll,My oath forbids me from uttering her very name - not unless she's revealed herself to you.
Wyll,"All these years, you'd think it's a lesson I'd have well learned."
Wyll,I'll say what I can. But it won't be enough.
Wyll,Trust me: he'll take what you're least ready to part with.
Wyll,And then take more still.
Wyll,He'll require of you only what you're least ready to part with.
Wyll,And then require more still.
Wyll,I was thirteen when she brought word of a goblin warband advancing on Rivington. Her keen scouting saved a hundred lives that day.
Wyll,I was eleven when the counsellor spotted and slayed an assassin who stalked father from the shadows.
Wyll,Then we know our mission. All roads converge at Moonrise.
Wyll,Raphael's angling for the girl's soul.
Wyll,"'A blushing apple, begging to be plucked.'"
Wyll,"I think she will. If not, well -"
Wyll,Only a halfwit or a jackass would even suggest it.
Wyll,"One way or another, she'll see there's no winning Raphael's game - and she'll walk away."
Wyll,- but I think she's clever enough to flee before the jaws close around her neck.
Wyll,We should at least try. The girl's as bold as a lamb cavorting in a lion's den -
Wyll,As I always have.
Wyll,And you're either a halfwit or a jackass for having done it.
Wyll,"And should that come to pass, death is the most pleasant outcome that fell bastard would give her."
Wyll,"Should the child take even a small step towards independence, she'll be punished."
Wyll,I can't imagine what cruel penance Mol would pay if she were ever to resist that fell bastard.
Wyll,You've seen what happens when a bound soul reaches for freedom.
Wyll,"Then Raphael collects another trophy, and Mol sells her independence to the Hells."
Wyll,"But as ambitious as she is, Mol's no fool. One way or another, she'll see there's no winning Raphael's game - and she'll walk away."
Wyll,"She's stubborn, yes - bold as a lamb cavorting in a lion's den."
Wyll,"'A blushing apple, begging to be plucked.'  He wants more than her loyalty. He wants her soul."
Wyll,"And given the same circumstance, I'd do it again. My soul was a necessary price to pay for... hrm-hrh..."
Wyll,You might think you'd give up anything for a cure.
Wyll,"If she's smart, she'll know she'd be getting a bum deal."
Wyll,'Soldier's Pet'. 'Papa's Prince'. 'Duke's Little Rich Boy'. 'The Babe of Frontiers'.
Wyll,I deserve that. Consider me properly shamed.
Wyll,"... not this. Not Zariel's victims, not innocent tieflings."
Wyll,"I'd be hunting devils and demons, Mizora said. Traitors and hypocrites - heartless evils of all sorts - but not..."
Wyll,Just look at me. I did what was right. And Mizora made me pay for it.
Wyll,Gods damn her straight back to the Hells.
Wyll,It was worth the sacrifice. All I can give you on that is my solemn word.
Wyll,But I'll say this: the moment I pacted myself to Mizora I have not regretted for a heartbeat. It was my proudest deed.
Wyll,"I can't utter the terms or circumstances of the pact. I can tell you most all else - but the pact? I'm forbidden, unless Mizora permits it."
Wyll,Ah. The one little question that put me out of house and home.
Wyll,"I wish I'd had a piece of your drive aeons ago, before I got years deep into blindly obeying Mizora."
Wyll,"This was a path I chose, thinking I knew all the terms. I thought wrong."
Wyll,"You were exploited, you were bound. I was not."
Wyll,"There could well be: she has the blighted thing, what I know of it is simply what has engraved itself upon my memory."
Wyll,"We can have all for it, but it won't so much as chip one of her nailed claws: She'll escape to the Hells. And if we succeeded, my life would be taken in exchange."
Wyll,"Without the pact, I'm just a man. What good is my blade then, when it's too dull to split monsters? What good is a flame when a mere breath snuffs it out?"
Wyll,That has been its tragedy. I've saved so many with the talents of the Blade.
Wyll,"She won't touch you, unless there's something there for her to take. Don't give her so much as an inkling there might be."
Wyll,"I'm so sorry to give you another reason to sleep restlessly, but it's my burden to bear."
Wyll,"We can, I'm sure of it. How glad I am that you see me as more than my patron's pet."
Wyll,The only way out is if I can out-bargain her. We're standing here with nothing but the clothes on our backs and the worms in our heads.
Wyll,"She could kill me, for one - and that's not the worst of it."
Wyll,"But I don't have half a clue where to start, other than play her games, and play by the rules. That's the only language devils listen to."
Wyll,A possibility that's kept me awake countless nights.
Wyll,"... not people like you. I swear, I didn't know."
Wyll,"I'm sorry, Karlach."
Wyll,It's... not unrelated. I wish I could tell you more.
Wyll,"I bear the image of one, at least. But my heart is the same."
Wyll,"Damn it all, what have I done?"
Wyll,"Fail, and I'm made a mindless blob clawing at demons on the front lines of the Blood War."
Wyll,Not a one. All that matters is that we free it.
Wyll,Either we find it - or I'm made a mindless blob clawing at demons on the front lines of the Blood War.
Wyll,"You're right, of course. Somewhere, there must a weak link, a loophole, an exploit."
Wyll,"The same thought crossed my mind. I am only to hunt the infernal, the demonic, and the heartless."
Wyll,And you shouldn't be.
Wyll,"Yes, unless I find a way to free myself from my devil's talons."
Wyll,"Yes, unless Mizora actually fulfils her promise and sets me free."
Wyll,She won't let me go without making a fuss. Trust me on that.
Wyll,Karlach showed us the truth. And I refused to see it.
Wyll,"But - I'm not going to celebrate 'til I'm actually free. I can feel Mizora scheming, plotting."
Wyll,"I always knew what my future held, and I know I chose right."
Wyll,And it means everything to me.
Wyll,One of the mindless blobs clawing at demons on the front lines of the Blood War.
Wyll,Not just rot. I'd have to fight.
Wyll,"I can already feel her scheming. She won't let me go without a fuss, trust me on this."
Wyll,Thank you - for sticking your neck out for me. I mean it. But - I'm not going to celebrate 'til I'm actually free.
Wyll,Mizora's set me on fiends inside and outside the Hells. She's never ordered a rescue.
Wyll,"... not Zariel's victims, not innocent tieflings."
Wyll,"I'd be hunting devils and demons, she said. Traitors and hypocrites - heartless evils of all sorts - but not..."
Wyll,I'd count my lucky stars for it - but I reckon luck is on holiday. I'm only alive because my patron still has use for me.
Wyll,Thank you - for sticking your neck out for me. I mean it.
Wyll,"I suppose you didn't mean to keep this blood-sucking habit a secret, either? Just slipped your mind, I suppose?"
Wyll,"Lucky for you, I'm not such a man."
Wyll,"A lesser man would sever that well-coiffed head from your neck for the insolence, without a moment's thought."
Wyll,This statue bears Balduran's likeness. We've found it - the great dragon's lair.
Wyll,"Venerable Balduran, Pride of the Three Seas. I am worthy."
Wyll,Is that so? Give me one reason why I shouldn't let them rot.
Wyll,"What do you want, Mizora?"
Wyll,I will make sure it's done.
Wyll,Never mind. I'll free Zariel's asset.
Wyll,How about I let the cult infect this devil instead? I bet they'd make a loyal thrall.
Wyll,I'll do it on one condition: you free me from this infernal pact.
Wyll,"If this devil is so powerful, how did they manage to get captured?"
Wyll,Forget it. This 'asset' can rot in there for all I care.
Wyll,"And this is my problem how, exactly?"
Wyll,Hells - I'm on my way.
Wyll,"Hells. It's her - Karlach, the archdevil's servant. We must rest in camp. It's time she had her due."
Wyll,You've stayed my blade. Friendship? Don't push it.
Wyll,You don't know what you're saying. You're asking me to trust a devil.
Wyll,You served her. That's enough to damn you.
Wyll,She's trying to trick us. Don't believe her lies.
Wyll,"Evidence. Proof that you're a devil, a gladiator in the archdevil Zariel's army."
Wyll,Your actions in the grove were indefensible. But Karlach seeks only to drive a deeper wedge between us than already exists.
Wyll,"Aye. Your reign of horror is over, Karlach."
Wyll,What happened in the grove was a horror - one I won't ignore. But nor will I let a devil roam the Coast unchallenged.
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate's saviour lies beyond this door. For all our sakes, don't turn your back."
Wyll,I won't explain myself to a devil. Face me!
Wyll,Do what he asks. My father's life is in his hands.
Wyll,Karlach!
Wyll,It's when you use words like 'agog' that I remember you're actually two centuries old.
Wyll,"Because their lives were cut brutally short, you mean."
Wyll,Doesn't ring a bell. Why?
Wyll,I don't think so. Why? Friend of yours?
Wyll,"I do miss the Gate, though. The Elfsong Tavern! Sunset over Grey Harbour! Fried fish at the docks!"
Wyll,I always loved this park. Spent a lot of time here as a boy battling imaginary monsters.
Wyll,"What in the hells are you playing at, Mizora?"
Wyll,Already? I thought Gortash would want to keep him around.
Wyll,Who knows? Let him die for all I care.
Wyll,I'll do anything to save him. Name your price!
Wyll,"You know something, don't you?"
Wyll,Where are they taking him?
Wyll,Mizora. Spare me your fake sympathy.
Wyll,You know something.
Wyll,Bloody hells. Where are they taking him?
Wyll,"I don't understand. I meant to knock him out, not kill him."
Wyll,Damn right he is. And he better stay that way.
Wyll,Are you saying my father's not gone for good?
Wyll,What are you getting at?
Wyll,"I've had enough, Mizora. What do you want?"
Wyll,"Shit - I don't understand it. The blow should have knocked him out, not killed him."
Wyll,"My father's here, Karlach. Cool your fires - he must not come to harm."
Wyll,"I'm not the only one after you, Karlach. Some paladins of Tyr want you dead, too. I suppose we're all wrong about you?"
Wyll,I didn't want those people to die. It was all a big mistake.
Wyll,I don't need to explain myself to Zariel's lickspittle. Your head is mine.
Wyll,Let's send them back where they came from.
Wyll,That sounds like exactly what I need.
Wyll,I will be.
Wyll,Dammit. This is an unwelcome complication.
Wyll,How can I make peace with the monster I was sent to kill?
Wyll,Save your breath. Let's see if this devil bleeds.
Wyll,You don't understand what you're asking me to do.
Wyll,How do I know this isn't another devil's trick?
Wyll,You almost seem to mean it.
Wyll,I'll give you one chance to explain what I just saw.
Wyll,My sources say otherwise. Not a devil? Prove it.
Wyll,You were engulfed in flames but a moment ago. Only a devil could have survived it.
Wyll,Aye. Truce.
Wyll,You would've died in the attempt. But - there have been enough threats today.
Wyll,"You really are no devil, are you? I've... I've been deceived."
Wyll,Shit.
Wyll,"If I believe you, Karlach, it'll be me who pays the price."
Wyll,You don't know what this means. You don't know what you're asking me to do.
Wyll,I won't fall for this devilish trickery.
Wyll,"I know who you are and I know who you serve. Zariel's lickspittle, gladiator in the archdevil's army."
Wyll,Join them in pushing against the wreckage.
Wyll,Sounds like a great plan.
Wyll,"Hang on - I said I'd help you, not team up with you long-term."
Wyll,So you want me to kill the people hunting you?
Wyll,Why should I do your dirty work?
Wyll,"You've got it all wrong. I've got a contract for your head, and I'm going to take it."
Wyll,"If you value your life, you'll stand down."
Wyll,"I don't know who told you I was involved in the grove, but it wasn't me."
Wyll,"If I'm wrong about you, prove it. Lay down your weapon, and I will too."
Wyll,"I've hunted you to the Hells and beyond. It ends here, Karlach."
Wyll,You fight in the Blood War for Zariel. You'll bring violence to the Coast.
Wyll,No... I won't fall for this devilish trickery...
Wyll,The tadpole that links us suggests you're no willing servant of Zariel.
Wyll,No - I can't believe it. I've been sent to kill you. I can't let you go.
Wyll,"I'm sorry, Karlach. There's too much at stake."
Wyll,No! Nothing like that at all.
Wyll,No. No second-guessing. The devil dies - now.
Wyll,I've broken a vow I swore never to break. My punishment will be severe.
Wyll,That remains to be seen. I'm sure I'll find out by nightfall.
Wyll,I've got more important things on my mind than monster-hunting at the moment.
Wyll,I have my own problems. I don't need yours.
Wyll,All right - welcome to the team.
Wyll,"I have good news for you, then. I already killed the paladins you say were hunting you."
Wyll,I don't think so - you'll have to go it alone.
Wyll,All right. Let's team up.
Wyll,I have good news for you. I already killed the paladins you say were hunting you.
Wyll,Let's do it.
Wyll,"It will mean my undoing, but... I believe you."
Wyll,"I'm surprised I never saw you lurking in the shadows at any Baldurian balls, Astarion."
Wyll,"I was planning to invite you to the ceremony, but I'm having second thoughts."
Wyll,"I've slayed a death dog or six, crossed a few duergar."
Wyll,It seems a rather... vain notion to me. But I can't say I haven't thought about it. How about you?
Wyll,I've faced countless perils and conquered them all. This will be no different.
Wyll,"An axe-bearing mountain of fur, she was. Gave me a nasty scar."
Wyll,Ah - it was a great scrap. A hungry minotaur with a hankering for human flesh.
Wyll,"Could be most anything. Their willingness to torment their travel partners with wisecracks, for example."
Wyll,"It's the furthest thing from my mind. Besides, Shadowheart - not all fiends are cut from the same scorched cloth.<br>"
Wyll,"Not so fond of the sewers, then?"
Wyll,"I don't see a problem, as long as mister fang there keeps his appetite in check."
Wyll,I'm really not that kind of man.
Wyll,"Well I'm hardly going to say 'oh come here, have a hug in the arms of Hadar'. "
Wyll,I'm surprised you're so fond of swords. A battleaxe would seem more suitable for a man of your... stature.
Wyll,"Ah, my thanks. Perhaps we might even marry, if fate wills it."
Wyll,"Relax, the both of you - it's Balduran, our city's valorant founder."
Wyll,"It's Balduran. Our city's valorant founder - and now, the illithid we carry in that gods-forsaken prism."
Wyll,"A bloody display of murderous power. Bhaal means to stoke fear, make us cower."
Wyll,But losing that early love is still the regret foremost of forgotten sorrows.
Wyll,"In the Gate especially, it's uncommon to marry your first love nowadays."
Wyll,"Then by all means, call me a fool."
Wyll,"No. I mean, I don't think so. Would you count a light spritz from a vial of jasmine dust as a pheromone?"
Wyll,"Ah, well, I admit I've had thoughts about it. In my own way."
Wyll,And incur the wrath of the Hells? I might as well just leap straight into the fires.
Wyll,Think of the... er... mess they'd make. Well - better your statue's head than your own.
Wyll,"We've chipped away a piece of the Absolute. It will take all our might, all our will, to fully shatter it."
Wyll,"I don't have to ask for permission, if that's what you mean."
Wyll,"I'm my own man, Shadowheart... in this sense, at least."
Wyll,"I'd watch yourself, my friend. I don't know if our pale rogue has anything good in his heart, or even a scrap of it left for you."
Wyll,"Mock me all you want, Astarion. We could use a little comic relief."
Wyll,"Finally, we're approaching Moonrise Towers."
Wyll,"Killed a few giant bats in my day, Astarion - but never hunted a vampire."
Wyll,"Sure, but think of the stories you'll be able to tell."
Wyll,"As much love as I hold for Baldur's Gate, these frontiers delight me as much as any bustling street."
Wyll,I'm afraid you'll have to content yourself with vagrant chickens.
Wyll,I'm feeling a bit parched and peckish.
Wyll,But I've always been a bit old-fashioned on these matters. I find more pleasure in a courtly dance than a loveless fling.
Wyll,"Sheltered? Not at all. I was exposed to all manner of riot and revelry. Hells, my father even urged me on once or twice."
Wyll,"Anything but. I don't fight to be flattered, Lae'zel. I fight to save lives."
Wyll,Ah - the memories. The Blushing Mermaid's where fifteen-year-old Wyll snuck his first kiss.
Wyll,"On that matter, you'll hear no argument from me."
Wyll,"Subtlety isn't exactly your forte, given how you've strolled about wearing a circlet inset with Shar's symbol."
Wyll,"A wedding to their betrothed, a new baby, a windfall... the taste of an exquisite pudding..."
Wyll,"If that's true, then so must be the opposite: there are people out there celebrating their lives' best moment."
Wyll,'All that goes on'?
Wyll,"And came to resent your tutor, I bet. I taught them to fight - not to hate."
Wyll,"Cruel words strengthen neither heads nor hearts, Shadowheart."
Wyll,"I'd rather not think of it, Shadowheart..."
Wyll,"Why 'y'? A great-uncle's name, my father said. But I just figured he couldn't spell."
Wyll,"'Y', that's right."
Wyll,"Ah, but to little harm. Shouldn't we all be allowed to stoke a few fires from time to time?"
Wyll,What happened here?
Wyll,"Hm. Once the Absolute's finished, I'll be sure to propose your idea to the Council."
Wyll,"The Coast's chief militia, led by none other than Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard himself."
Wyll,Should it be any wonder? The Chionthar's waters carry merchant vessels from as far east as Berdusk.
Wyll,Promise it will last less than half an hour?
Wyll,"I'm probably going to regret this, but Gale - if I'm to be wed, would you like to make a speech?"
Wyll,"I'd have love to have witnessed it, Gale. I wager you are as elegant on the dance floor as you are on the battlefield."
Wyll,"A kind offer, but I think I'd rather pursue things the old fashioned way."
Wyll,"If we continue this way, we may get too close for comfort."
Wyll,"I've glimpsed that doom during my travels, but never dared get close."
Wyll,"More importantly, the land west of here suffers under a terrible curse."
Wyll,I'm betting on all of us.
Wyll,"In that case, someone needs to survive to tell the story. "
Wyll,"Then let us push forward, heads high, weapons in hand, and turn this tower to rubble."
Wyll,Perhaps some of their work even graces Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,"Then some masons were more blessed still, if they could put their talents to use elsewhere."
Wyll,Perhaps it's a blessing that none of them survived to see it fall to the shadows.
Wyll,I wonder what those archives will reveal about us a hundred years hence.
Wyll,Baldur's Gate harbours many a secret. Even the longest-lived explorers have yet to uncover them all.
Wyll,"To start? Lure it into the sun, drive a stake through its heart. Why?"
Wyll,And that's not the end of it. The suckers are wily. No offence.
Wyll,"A full-on vamp, you mean? Lure it into the sun, drive a stake through its heart."
Wyll,Some. And you? Seems a perfect hunting ground for... you know.
Wyll,I never was scared of the shadows.
Wyll,"And they wouldn't have brought just trade goods, but song, dance, and custom. Riches of the mind and the spirit."
Wyll,So much was lost when the darkness fell.
Wyll,"Enough to make me thirsty, even. I've always preferred wine to whiskey and ale, but I certainly wouldn't turn away a full flagon right about now."
Wyll,"I say we put an end to your dry spell. Once Ketheric falls, the first round's on me."
Wyll,"I get it, Lae'zel - peril, danger, and so forth. All I can think of now is a nice fish dinner."
Wyll,The only thing the wind's carrying is the smell of trout. Lae'zel. We're near the fish market.
Wyll,"You don't know the half of it. With a bit of luck, we'll meet a beholder."
Wyll,Well I'll be. So even the ferocious Lae'zel has a soft side.
Wyll,"Ah, the City of Splendours. Spent a whole Fleetswake there with my father. What a delight."
Wyll,Couldn't say. Maybe because an entirely different curse has befallen the tomb.
Wyll,Their belief is grounded in loss. Hardly a laughing matter.
Wyll,As if could ever refuse you.
Wyll,"Thank you, Karlach."
Wyll,"You know, I think I am. It certainly didn't put off my - er- dance partner."
Wyll,"The smell getting to you, Lae'zel?"
Wyll,Wouldn't you like to know?
Wyll,"It would be my pleasure, Karlach - once the Absolute's been crushed for good."
Wyll,"Hm - perhaps your talent lies in dancing, instead?"
Wyll,I reckon there wasn't much merry-making in the Hells.
Wyll,"I intend to find out. But we should scout around first, see who's in need of help."
Wyll,Possibly. But I wager there's something deeper at work here.
Wyll,"Why not? If this adventure has taught me anything, it's that life is fragile, and we should seize joy when we can. You think I'm being rash?"
Wyll,I don't need to imagine. I've got the souvenir in my skull to prove it.
Wyll,"Forever could be tomorrow. Better to promise to do your utmost, as long as you have the moments left to share."
Wyll,That reminds me - how in the Nine Hells could goblins capture a chap as well-muscled as you?
Wyll,"Another nature metaphor? I admire your consistency, Halsin."
Wyll,"Ah, I just needed a moment of quiet, to think, that's all."
Wyll, Origin Moment Choice - Option B 
Wyll, Origin Moment Choice - Option A 
Wyll, Origin Moment Companion Intent  
Wyll,What in the - are we stuck with the damn thing?
Wyll,Something tells me it'll take more than a few twists to break that box open.
Wyll,There's something about that thing - can't keep my eyes off it.
Wyll,"Ah, yes, that classic tune: 'Ode to a Shrieking Owlbear'."
Wyll,How lovely - a natural tunesmith!<br>
Wyll,Poor man! That's no way to treat a stranger in need.
Wyll,"Gale's one of us, and we should stand by his side.<br>"
Wyll,"Have a heart. Gale is one of us, and we should stand by his side."
Wyll,"Come now, have a heart. Gale is one of us, and we should stand by his side."
Wyll,Very well - but I'm keeping an eye on you. And no wisecracks about having us for supper.
Wyll,Hunting with vampires? Never thought I'd see the day.
Wyll,Fine - as long as he keeps his fangs off our necks.
Wyll,"No, no - unless my mind's gone a-muddle, I think you mean 'bottom right'."
Wyll,Hmm - I think it's the one ending in 'ash'. Easy mistake.
Wyll,Whoops - I think you meant 'purple'.
Wyll,"Karlach's fallen at last. Tonight, the people of the Coast can breath easier."
Wyll,A Shar worshipper? Not my usual quarry - nor my usual ally.
Wyll,"The wyrm is dead, father. Where we might have once found a friend, we found only his bones, animated by an old grievance."
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate stands on the brink of the abyss. My father was clear: we awaken the wyrm, and take back the city."
Wyll,"I am the defender of the weak, I am the stalker of devils -"
Wyll,"I have slain monsters, faced illithids, guarded the helpless. To be a duke - is this the destiny I've awaited? Is the nobility my calling?"
Wyll,Balduran's bones - what's that about?
Wyll,"Holy hells. By the looks of it, we're stuck with the damned thing."
Wyll,A charming couple. I think my heart just grew two sizes.
Wyll,"Nine-Fingers - a name that could make a city guard tremble. If they aren't already on her payroll, that is."
Wyll,"Sever the pact now, or I'll sever your head."
Wyll,Gather your strength and smash your foot through the pod.
Wyll,Say you know a pact-breaking charm and chant a series of pseudo-Infernal phrases.
Wyll,Ponder the ins and outs of your contract. Could there be a loophole?
Wyll,"'Abi, diabole, et nunquam redi.'"
Wyll,"Figures. All that talk about 'Zariel's asset', I should've known you were lying."
Wyll,"I share my talents, and you reward me with this rotten tripe?"
Wyll,"Hells, what are you - no!"
Wyll,Hells. What's happening? What have you -
Wyll,Fine. Let her out.
Wyll,Grand Duke? My soul lies with the city. But...
Wyll,I'll do it - and you'll set me free. That was the deal.
Wyll,How about I let the cult infect you instead? I bet you'd make a loyal thrall.
Wyll,"Not yet, Mizora - it's a seller's market now. Time we struck up a new deal."
Wyll,Mizora.
Wyll,Only a little taken.
Wyll,"I have hunted spawn as the Blade. Driven by agonising hunger, every last one."
Wyll,"Make a meal of anyone I call 'friend', Astarion - and they will be your last. That is my solemn promise."
Wyll,"Oh, Karlach. No news could have made me happier in this house of horrors."
Wyll,"You can't kill her, Jaheira - she'll escape to Avernus sooner than you could snatch a blade."
Wyll,I'd cling to life forever if it means I could keep Baldur's Gate safe. But time marches me to a different fate.
Wyll,She runs the Guild. Which itself runs every criminal enterprise in the city.
Wyll,"You're free, Mizora. I held up my end. Now you hold up yours. Sever the pact."
Wyll,"Fine, six months it is. What happens next?"
Wyll,"The Blade of Frontiers is no more. I will be Wyll Ravengard, son of Ulder, proud Duke of Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. These were the lessons my father taught me.
Wyll,It isn't what you think. It never was.
Wyll,Damn I right I did. My father is safe and my chains are broken!
Wyll,The elder brain is first on the list. Everything else will need to wait.
Wyll,'Our' order of business? You need to stay out of Baldur's Gate's affairs.
Wyll,You wanted to hurt me.
Wyll,You absolute shit-stain!
Wyll,"It isn't much of a home, but what's ours is yours."
Wyll,"If that changes, don't be afraid to pipe up. I'll get you sorted."
Wyll,Just checking in - is there anything you need?
Wyll,There is. Though I'm not about to sing it for you.
Wyll,"Ah - is that the one with the, er, bawdy lyrics?"
Wyll,That's what they call me.
Wyll,"That's what they called me - at least, 'til I grew these pesky horns."
Wyll,"Keep your cool - this one's all bite, no bark. Or is it the other way around?"
Wyll,What are you doing?
Wyll,"Destroy them, and quickly. We need to find my father!"
Wyll,"Father? Gods, no. I'm so sorry..."
Wyll,"Hells, no! Father, I'm - I'm so sorry..."
Wyll,"Hells - our time is short. My father is here, and by the living gods, I will free him."
Wyll,"Father, come. Mizora's here - we need to get moving."
Wyll,"Father, come. I'm getting you out of here."
Wyll,"Father, please - there's something I must show you."
Wyll,"No, please. Father - let me show you."
Wyll,"Everything I did, I did for Baldur's Gate. I did for you."
Wyll,There's nothing to forgive. You wanted to protect the city. I only ever wanted the same.
Wyll,"No manner of duke should save a city, only to open a gate to the Hells."
Wyll,They're right and we both know it. No manner of duke should be tied to a devil's leash.
Wyll,She's right and we both know it. No manner of duke should be tied to a devil's leash.
Wyll,He's right and we both know it. No manner of duke should be tied to a devil's leash.
Wyll,"For as long as demons and devils imperil the Sword Coast, they will be my prey."
Wyll,I am now the Blade of Avernus.
Wyll,There will be no Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard. And there will be no Blade of Frontiers.
Wyll,"It is in the wilds that I find my courage, not in the halls of Upper City estates."
Wyll,"I fought to right the wrongs of the Coast, to slay the men and monsters that hunt the helpless."
Wyll,Grand Duke? I look the part of a fiend.
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate is my home, and I am its servant. I will be relentless in my pursuit of the greatest good."
Wyll,Grand Duke? I look the part of a fiend. A half-devil possesses my very soul.
Wyll,"I failed, father. The wyrm is fallen."
Wyll,Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. I remember them well. You made me recite them every morning.
Wyll,"I am Wyll Ravengard, son of Ulder!"
Wyll,"In Ansur's defeat, I've found my spirit renewed. Once I've vanquished the Absolute, I will walk in your footsteps and lead the city as a Grand Duke."
Wyll,I am the Blade of Avernus!
Wyll,"In Ansur's defeat, I've found my spirit renewed. For as long as devils and demons imperil the Sword Coast, they will by my prey."
Wyll,I am the Blade of Frontiers!
Wyll,"In Ansur's defeat, I've found my spirit renewed. For as long as the Sword Coast needs a champion, I've vowed to answer its call."
Wyll,"But the Heart of the Gate still lives - in me, in my allies."
Wyll,"Do you mean Ansur? The wyrm is dead, father. Where we might have once found a friend, we found only his bones, animated by an old grievance."
Wyll,I don't understand.
Wyll,"Your heart's cold as ice, Astarion. I'm just making sure no one slips and gets hurt."
Wyll,So that's it? All this trouble and not a single reward?
Wyll,"Fine, you're free. What happens next?"
Wyll,Please. You're staking the city's future on a fairy tale.
Wyll,Your faith in me is well-founded. I will seek the wyrm and ask for his help.
Wyll,Do you mean Ansur? He's dead.
Wyll,"Do you mean Ansur? The dragon is dead, Eltan."
Wyll,Do you mean there's a dragon living under the city?
Wyll,"Mizora is a devil - she lied to you. I wanted to save my father, and she sabotaged me."
Wyll,Father's death was Gortash's doing. There was nothing I could do.
Wyll,I have saved countless lives. I am still the man you thought I was.
Wyll,Zariel's stunt destroyed countless lives. Mizora is her minion - you can't trust her.
Wyll,"It will be done. I will seek the wyrm. Together, we will strike down the Absolute."
Wyll,A wyrm? Do you mean there's a dragon living under the city?
Wyll,Do you mean Ansur? The dragon is dead.
Wyll,"Do you mean Ansur? He's naught but bones, Eltan. But his spirit has blessed me with power."
Wyll,"She lied to you, Eltan. I did everything in my power to get my father to safety!"
Wyll,Father's death was Gortash's doing. There was nothing I could do!
Wyll,"On my honour, father's still alive. And I intend to save him."
Wyll,"It's true, Eltan. You can't believe her. She's a devil. Will you really trust her word over mine?"
Wyll,Tell me more.
Wyll,Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. I remember the lessons well. Father made me recite them every morning.
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate stands on the brink of the abyss. We'll need all the help we can get. Let's awaken the wyrm, and take back the city."
Wyll,I swear I did everything I could to save him. I swear it by all I hold dear. 
Wyll,Let the dragon sleep. I'll deal with the Absolute on my own terms.
Wyll,A wyrm? Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?
Wyll,A relevant thread of knowledge pokes at your mind. Explore it.
Wyll,Probe Eltan's mind.
Wyll,"Go on, my good man. You can't exactly deny a goddess, now can you?"
Wyll,"Go on, my good man - your goddess awaits. Let us pray that good wisdom prevails."
Wyll,She hides behind a projection. It's time we find the Mother Superior in flesh.
Wyll,"Do you mean Ansur? He's naught but bones, Florrick. But his spirit has blessed me with power."
Wyll,"She lied to you, Florrick. I did everything in my power to get my father to safety!"
Wyll,"Well played, Florrick. But you will not stand in my way - the city is mine by rights."
Wyll,"When you were holed up in Wyrm's Rock, you'd given up. Who's the hypocrite here?"
Wyll,Probe Florrick's mind.
Wyll,Waking a dragon doesn't sound like a good idea.
Wyll,What lessons do you mean?
Wyll,Eltan. I am my father's son. Will you really trust the word of a devil over mine?
Wyll,Your faith in me is well-founded. I will seek the wyrm and ask for his help. 
Wyll,"The dragon Ansur is dead, Florrick."
Wyll,Are you saying there's a dragon living under the city?
Wyll,"Mizora lied to you. I wanted to save my father, and the devil sabotaged me."
Wyll,"It's true, Florrick. You can't believe her. She's a devil. Will you really trust her word over mine?"
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate stands on the brink of the abyss. Let's awaken the wyrm, and take back the city."
Wyll,I would like to know more about this wyrm.
Wyll,Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. I remember them well. Father made me recite them every morning.
Wyll,I swear I did everything I could to save him. I swear it by all I hold dear.
Wyll,Florrick. I am my father's son. You know me. Will you really trust the word of a devil over mine?
Wyll,"Well played, Eltan. But you will not stand in my way - the city is mine by rights."
Wyll,The dragon Ansur is dead.
Wyll,I've got half a mind to kill you where you stand.
Wyll,"Cordula Eltan? By the Nine Hells, what are you on about?"
Wyll,Astarion - please. No power is worth these prisoners' torment.
Wyll,I once roped a catoblepas and rode it like a horse!
Wyll,"I've bested a red dragon in battle, and crafted a club from its tooth!"
Wyll,I wrestled a swamp croc... naked!
Wyll,I frightened the feathers off an owlbear with a single roar.
Wyll,I won't be part of this. You'll get them all killed.
Wyll,Hardly necessary. I'll raid the goblin camp and kill them myself. 
Wyll,You're teaching them to fight? They're mere children!
Wyll,"By the dead gods, are all gith so brutal?"
Wyll,"That thing's killing her. Do something, damn it!"
Wyll,What have we here? Hold on - I need to relish the moment.
Wyll,"Fine, let's get on with it."
Wyll,Poor thing. I'll let you out of there.
Wyll,Leave her there.
Wyll,Connect your mind to the 'unleash' device and activate it.
Wyll,Connect your mind to the device on the right and activate it.
Wyll,Connect your mind to the 'annihilate' device and activate it.
Wyll,Connect your mind to the device on the left and activate it.
Wyll,Examine the device on the right.
Wyll,[PassiveRoll] 
Wyll,Examine the device on the left.
Wyll,You'd think I'd get a reward for going through all this trouble.
Wyll,I climbed the Ice Mountains and stabbed a yeti with an icicle.
Wyll,"Bad news, children: you're all going to die."
Wyll,The sort of thing that might interest Wyll.
Wyll,We should give it a read.
Wyll,Hells. I see your scars - in full view.
Wyll,No! What are you doing?!
Wyll,"They're victims, Astarion - just like you. They deserve freedom, too."
Wyll,"And sacrifice all these people? Please - no power is worth their anguish, Astarion."
Wyll,"Please - I know we must talk. But for now, I need you safe. Go to our camp - we'll catch up there."
Wyll,"Please - I know you have questions. But for now, I need you safe. We'll talk soon enough."
Wyll,"I know you have questions. Please, go to our camp - you'll be safe there. We'll talk soon enough."
Wyll,"I know you have questions. But for now, I need you safe. Go to my camp. We'll talk soon enough."
Wyll,Father.
Wyll,Is that your way of saying 'thank you'?
Wyll,Come on. There's nothing left for us here.
Wyll,Go to my camp and wait for me. I'll explain everything there.
Wyll,I just saved your life. I was a fool to think you'd thank me.
Wyll,Father. I'm so pleased you're safe.
Wyll,Let's hurry!
Wyll,"Words of the cold-hearted. I beg you, do not let him suffer!"
Wyll,"Go, then. Quickly!"
Wyll,Never mind.
Wyll,That's true - but he never got kidnapped by a devil either.
Wyll,"Ever heard of the Blade of Frontiers, kid? If you like monster-smashing, you might be a fan of his work."
Wyll,Are we killing in cold blood now?
Wyll,What in the Hells are you planning to do?<br>
Wyll,I'm starting to think I should have let you die.
Wyll,"The Gur was a monster hunter, not so different from me - and we slayed him on your behalf."
Wyll,"Astarion, I just want to say - I judged you wrongly. I'm sorry."
Wyll,"Astarion, I was wrong about you. Truly wrong about you."
Wyll,"Gortash is the Black Lord's thrall. A liar, a tyrant. He'd sooner have our heads than share his domain."
Wyll,"We should hurry to this mystery prison and retrieve father, before Mizora tries pulling more tricks."
Wyll,"Besides, there's no time to wallow in self-pity. More than anything, I'm elated that there's hope yet for my father."
Wyll,"The Hells will take my soul. I'll make my peace with it - I have once already, after all."
Wyll,"Sometimes, fate closes a door for good. The bolt is fastened, the key is destroyed, and a wish is forever locked away."
Wyll,"Well - that's enough self-pity for one day. If anything, I should be elated that there's hope yet for my father."
Wyll,"My pact ends at death, and Zariel may want more than just fodder for her front line."
Wyll,She could raise me as a wardevil and loose me on the Coast. She could name me a patron and bid me collect souls for her cause.
Wyll,"Karlach can tell you what evil she's capable of, what brutality she's wrought."
Wyll,"I don't need to tell you what evil she's capable of, what brutality she's wrought."
Wyll,But my soul belongs to a far more fiendish villain now. The archdevil Zariel.
Wyll,"That means a lot. But understand, I don't plan to wallow in self-pity. More than anything, I'm elated that there's hope yet for my father."
Wyll,"But my father will live. We will return the Grand Duke to his people. And forever, a devil's leash will choke me."
Wyll,"Twice, Mizora's held my feet to the fire - and twice was I burnt."
Wyll,"Always good to talk, my friend."
Wyll,"And yes, I should have told you sooner. But I am a man of two faces."
Wyll,"No use pretending anymore, is it? Duke Ravengard is my father - though I suppose I'm speaking the obvious."
Wyll,"Lucky for us, we've got a knack for miracles. Let's reunite the girl with her mother and father. She deserves that much."
Wyll,The shadows are cruel. It would take a miracle for Arabella's mother and father to survive them.
Wyll,I can't activate this here.
Wyll,"The more bullshit she pours, the more of it I'm forced to swallow."
Wyll,His anger is inevitable. I didn't sign this pact just to let my father rot in Gortash's prison.
Wyll,That was incredible!
Wyll,This prison's in the Lower City. Let's move.
Wyll,"I'm not sure if you meant to be funny or mean. Hells, I'm not even sure it matters - you're still good for a laugh."
Wyll,"It's a tantalising prospect. How better to protect the frontiers, than as a Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate? What evils could I vanquish with the Flaming Fist at my command?"
Wyll,"But freedom will be paid in my father's blood. Tomorrow, I celebrate my gain. Today, I mourn my loss. "
Wyll,We tear the elder brain's hooks out of this city.
Wyll,We obtain the final two Netherstones and take back our minds - and the city - from the brain.
Wyll,We obtain Gortash's Netherstone and take back our minds - and the city - from the brain.
Wyll,We obtain Orin's Netherstone and take back our minds - and the city - from the brain.
Wyll,We should pursue this great wyrm of legend. What ally could prove more fearsome than a raging dragon?
Wyll,I'd be a fool to wish otherwise.
Wyll,I signed his life away before the Hells' witnesses. It would be easier to drink the Styx down to the last drop than to alter his fate.
Wyll,"But freedom was paid in my father's blood. Tomorrow, I celebrate my gain. Today, I mourn my loss. "
Wyll,"I have to believe that. I'm not the Hells' puppet in life, nor its warrior in death. The Blade will be guiding his own hand."
Wyll,My father will die. His blood will pay for my freedom. What sort of man would I be if I had no remorse?
Wyll,"But I won't miss the Mizora's leash squeezing my neck. Tomorrow, I celebrate my gain. But today, I mourn my loss."
Wyll,My father is gone. His blood paid for my freedom. What sort of man would I be if I had no remorse?
Wyll,I never knew freedom could taste so bittersweet.
Wyll,I spent seven years choked by Mizora's leash. And I spent seven years hoping to break free.
Wyll,Gods.
Wyll,Well then. I'm not about to say 'no'.
Wyll,Why would you do that?
Wyll,We will knock him out if we need to. Or restrain -
Wyll,Zariel could do more than conscript me into her legions as a lemure.
Wyll,Heh. *Chuckles*
Wyll,"Please, we need to see to my father."
Wyll,"Keep moving, keep fighting. No holding back."
Wyll,About what happened - we need to talk.
Wyll,"By Balduran's helm, I wish we could have danced forever."
Wyll,"The goblins still infest the roads. As long as their leaders live, Zevlor's people are trapped."
Wyll,All right. But not too much later - I need to clear the air between us.
Wyll,"There's something I need to say, something important. Can you spare a moment?"
Wyll,All right.
Wyll,Father will be waiting in camp. It's about time we talked.
Wyll,"Besides, I find it gives one an air of mystique. No one's more intriguing than an adventurer with one eye."
Wyll,"Besides, I find it gives one an air of mystique. No one's more intriguing than a woman with one eye."
Wyll,"Besides, I find it gives one an air of mystique. No one's more intriguing than a man with one eye."
Wyll,"Not to minimise the pain of Volo's poking and prodding, but I promise: you'll be used to the prosthesis in no time."
Wyll,"Welcome to the League of the Lone Eye, my friend."
Wyll,"Time's been stilled in this place. Peaceful - and disquieting, too. We should return to the crèche when we're able."
Wyll,That's the spirit.
Wyll,"Make some room, and I'm all yours."
Wyll,And just when things were warming up.
Wyll,"An excellent choice, if I say so myself."
Wyll,Are you sure? The Blade stands at the ready.
Wyll,Just some food for thought.
Wyll,"Big bomb be damned, you've got everything you need to defeat the Absolute already: Talent, nerve, and powerful allies at your side."
Wyll,"The faith that matters is that which you hold in yourself, in the ones that most matter to you."
Wyll,"To me, it all sounds like nonsense."
Wyll,"Since we don't have forever, I wager the memory will have to do."
Wyll,Indeed? I - I shiver just thinking about it. That day can't come soon enough.
Wyll,"Me too. And once we've cured these infections of ours, I hope we'll share more nights just like it."
Wyll,"Heh. And then like roaches, the troubles all came crawling back."
Wyll,We'll talk later.
Wyll,"Our happily-ever-after wasn't to be, but I still treasure our alliance. Now come - we've plenty of work still ahead of us."
Wyll,Well met.
Wyll,You've got something to say?
Wyll,"And lest we forget, we've a devil to rescue. Two missions, one destination."
Wyll,My father is somewhere in this tower. I won't leave him in Thorm's hands.
Wyll,But Thorm  - he is made of pure hate. The Sword Coast will rejoice when the bastard's fallen. 
Wyll,"In my years as the Blade, I've witnessed countless cruelties, faced unimaginable evil."
Wyll,"This is unlocked elsewhere, apparently."
Wyll,Anything more we should discuss?
Wyll,"Presuming, of course, the people can stomach the sight of these gods-damned horns."
Wyll,What else is on your mind?
Wyll,"Ah, but I'm sure you didn't come by to bask in shameless flattery. To what do I owe the pleasure?"
Wyll,"Oh, that smile - it could light up a room. Hells, it could light up the entire Bay of Balduran."
Wyll,It'll be worth the wait.
Wyll,"Now now, no prodding. You don't want to spoil the surprise. But I'll say this:"
Wyll,"I'm sure we will. And when the time comes, I've got something in mind."
Wyll,"Oh goodness, my cheeks've gone warm. Am I blushing? I must be blushing."
Wyll,"Unforgettable, I'd say. The right time, the right place - and the right person."
Wyll,"Since the party, I've had a spring in my step. And I've got you to thank."
Wyll,Just... just awful.
Wyll,"Ah, well. I guess that's my cue to change the subject."
Wyll,"Well, um - to what do I owe the pleasure?"
Wyll,"The leash has been broken, and my father is dead. Tomorrow, I celebrate my gain. But today, I mourn my loss. "
Wyll,"The leash has been broken, and my father left for dead. Tomorrow, I celebrate my gain. But today, I mourn my loss."
Wyll,"But that doesn't mean that the leash never chafed, that I was content to lap up whatever nonsense Mizora fed me."
Wyll,Deal?
Wyll,"Keep your fangs out of innocent flesh, and I won't drive a stake through your pasty-white chest."
Wyll,"Let's make a bargain. A pact, if you will:"
Wyll,"Good thing for you you're so godsdamned charming. Besides, once I've made an ally, I'm not so quick to abandon him."
Wyll,"Yours wouldn't be the first spawn-skull I've severed, you know. In all honesty, I'm half-inclined to sever it now."
Wyll,Hells. The very sort I vowed on my good eye to slay.
Wyll,Good thing for you I'm not such a man. Besides - not even the Blade of Frontiers is immune to your not-inconsiderable charms.
Wyll,A lesser man might sever that well-coiffed head from your neck.
Wyll,You may as well scrawl a red 'V' on your forehead.
Wyll,"Let's see. There's the pallid skin, the stealthy tendencies, the long canines -"
Wyll,Come now. Did you you think I couldn't tell?
Wyll,"I wish I could be so flippant. But the thought of him laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"Yes. My choice. But the thought of him laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,Well. I mourned him the day I ended the pact. There's no sense in mourning again.
Wyll,"I know this is my doing. My choice, my burden. But the thought of him laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,But to know he's well and truly... gone...
Wyll,Hells. I'd prepared myself. I thought I was ready.
Wyll,"If only I could be so flippant. To see my father laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"You're... you're right. But to see my father laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"To see my father laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"Why infect and imprison him, only to kill him? I - I don't understand..."
Wyll,Finally - a pact I can get fully behind.
Wyll,"Do what you must, then - and I'll do the same."
Wyll,But I'll leave you with some food for thought: not every bloody mess can be tidied up with a cocksure grin and a cheeky quip.
Wyll,"Something bothering you, Astarion?"
Wyll,"Strange, given how you plunged those pointed canines right into my neck."
Wyll,The most peaceful rest I had in ages.
Wyll,"Godsdamnit, Astarion. A lesser man would sever that well-coiffed head from your neck without a moment's hesitation."
Wyll,Ouch! What in the Hells? Oh shit - you're a gods-damned vampire?
Wyll,"Go on, keep up your charade. Just don't expect that ever bloody mess you make can be cleaned up with a cocksure grin and a cheeky quip."
Wyll,Good thing for you I'm not such a man.
Wyll,"I've spent years hunting monsters, Astarion. Do you think the Blade of Frontiers is ignorant to vampire spawn?"
Wyll,But desperate times call for desperate alliances. And not even the Blade of Frontiers is immune to your not-inconsiderable charms.
Wyll,"We're being honest, are we? Then let me respond in kind: I briefly considered severing that admittedly well-coiffed head from your neck."
Wyll,A lie as obvious as those cursed fangs of yours. A lesser man might sever that well-coiffed head from your neck for the insolence.
Wyll,"My father, gone. I can hardly believe it."
Wyll,Your tongue tied and knotted by a dominating master? The sort of hell I can relate to.
Wyll,And you think deceit was the best way to keep your admittedly well-coiffed skull intact?
Wyll,"Astarion - If I wanted your well-coiffed head, I'd have already taken it. Yours wouldn't be the first spawn-skull I've severed."
Wyll,You may as well scrawl a red 'V' on your forehead. Why didn't you tell me?
Wyll,As if it weren't obvious.
Wyll,- not to mention a tell-tale tendency to bite your foes during battle.
Wyll,I know you're a vampire. And I think it's time you came clean.
Wyll,"Let's have a chat, Astarion, just you and me."
Wyll,Good thing for you you're so godsdamned charming.
Wyll,"Yours wouldn't be the first spawn-skull I've severed, you know. Hells, I'm half-inclined to sever it now, if only for your endless insolence."
Wyll,A vampire spawn. The sort of monster I swore on my good eye to slay.
Wyll,"I'm half-inclined to sever it now, if only for your endless insolence. Good thing for you you're   so godsdamned charming."
Wyll,"I don't know what drives a man to consider his own death, among countless others, to be an appropriate exchange for his goddess' forgiveness."
Wyll,"I wish I could be so flippant. But to see him laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"Yes. My choice. But to see him laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"No pardon without repentance, and no penalty without mercy. I shall always apply this axiom of justice, my good wizard. This, I promise you."
Wyll,"The Blade of Frontiers is dead. I will be Wyll Ravengard, proud Duke of Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,Memories of my father will fade. I will be the Ravengard recorded in the histories.
Wyll,Yes - I will walk the same halls as my father and command the same soldiers. I will raise the city to new glory.
Wyll,"Imagine - bending the will of the citizens with a single decree, bringing my enemies to their knees with a single threat."
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate is my home, and I am its servant. I will be relentless in my pursuit of the greatest good. I will never let Mizora's hand endanger the city - I'd sooner die."
Wyll,I am the Blade of Frontiers.
Wyll,There will be no Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard.
Wyll,I am now The Blade of Avernus.
Wyll,You're right of course. No manner of duke should be tied to a devil's leash.
Wyll,"What good is a champion who puts himself above the people? What good am I as a politician, just out of reach?"
Wyll,"You're right. I fought to right the wrongs of the Coast, to slay the monsters that hunt the helpless."
Wyll,"If I were to call myself Grand Duke, no patriar would deny the claim."
Wyll,"The Absolute's end would be the guarantee, devilish visage be damned."
Wyll,The Absolute's end would be the guarantee.
Wyll,"'Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard.' Marshal of the Flaming Fist, the city's truest defender."
Wyll,I could even claim my father's own ducal title and carry his banner after this.
Wyll,Yes. The brain will fall - and the people will hail us as champions.
Wyll,We are the warriors who'll slay the Absolute. We are the guardians who'll defend this fair city.
Wyll,"What hope, then, for Baldur's Gate? Without the great wyrm's aid, is the city doomed to fall?"
Wyll,"There will be no great tempest roaring through the skies, no dragon redeemer to save us."
Wyll,"Never let it be said you have no heart, Karlach."
Wyll,"No pardon without repentance, and no penalty without mercy. I shall always apply this axiom of justice. This, I promise you."
Wyll,"No pardon without repentance, and no penalty without mercy. I shall always apply this axiom of justice, my good ranger. And Boo, of course."
Wyll,"I fought to right the wrongs of the Coast, to slay the monsters that hunt the helpless."
Wyll,"I know this is my doing. My choice, my burden. But to see him laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"But to see him like that, forever gone..."
Wyll,I'd prepared myself. I thought I was ready.
Wyll,"It's done, then."
Wyll,"If only I could be so flippant. To think of my father laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,I will destroy the elder brain. Grand Duke Ulder Ravngard will be avenged.
Wyll,Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard will be avenged.
Wyll,I will make Orin pay. And I will make that godsforsaken elder brain pay.
Wyll,I will make Gortash pay. And I will make that godsforsaken elder brain pay.
Wyll,I will make Gortash pay. I will make Orin pay. And I will make that godsforsaken elder brain pay.
Wyll,Well. I mourned him the day I ended my pact. There's no sense in mourning again.
Wyll,"You're... you're right. But to think of my father laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"Why infect him and imprison him, only to kill him? I - I don't understand..."
Wyll,What? That - I - I can hardly believe it... He had so much life left in him.
Wyll,Ansur is dead.
Wyll,We need to see my father. He should know what happened with Ansur.
Wyll,The Heart of the Gate is dead.
Wyll,I failed.
Wyll,To camp. Father should know of Ansur's fate.
Wyll,The brain will fall - and the people will hail us as champions.
Wyll,"When the brain dies, so to will the tadpoles it calls to - ours among them. The people will hail us as champions."
Wyll,"Perhaps. But we will still smite the brain, and still be hailed as champions."
Wyll,"To think of my father laying there, lifeless..."
Wyll,"Listen, Gale - I might invoke the Triad from time to time, appeal to Helm. But I'm no man of faith. Not like you."
Wyll,"Quite an explosive secret to keep to yourself, Gale."
Wyll,A shame my first brush with the famed Elminster couldn't be a tad more... optimistic.
Wyll,"I really didn't expect the affair to last between the two of you, Lae'zel. Is it getting to be something more?"
Wyll,"I can count on you to vouch for me, I hope."
Wyll,"Lae'zel, are you sure of the greeting we'll find at this crèche of yours?"
Wyll,Really? I figured you would have joined your fellow gith in a colony raid.
Wyll,Lae'zel - did you ever fight illithid creatures in your training days?
Wyll,"Can an illithid go solo, Lae'zel? You know - break free of their master?"
Wyll,"Who's in charge of the mind flayers, Lae'zel? Is there a squid king or something?"
Wyll,Not exactly. But you answered my question.
Wyll,"Lae'zel, have you ever done a good deed just for the sake of it?"
Wyll,"Well, yes. But also trouble."
Wyll,"Smell that, Karlach?"
Wyll,You're worth more respect than every last rogue in this city. I hope you know that.
Wyll,"The fact one of your first dates is going to be one of your last... it's just not fair, Karlach."
Wyll,"And seeing you've got someone to care about now, after ten bloody years, what would you say? 'Good for you, mate.'? "
Wyll,"Karlach... I know I say this every day, but I'm so glad you're here."
Wyll,Gods. I'm glad you got out of there.
Wyll,Did Zariel know you'd be unable to touch anyone when she crammed that awful thing into your chest?
Wyll,"My first visit to the undercity. A haven for undead, or so my tutors said."
Wyll,The Fist aren't what they used to be.
Wyll,Odd - I'd expect a Flaming Fist or four to be stationed nearby.
Wyll,"Oh, he pretended to be cross. But there was no hiding the sly grin that crept on his face."
Wyll,Congratulations - I think.
Wyll,"I hope my home can be yours, if you don't go back to the skies."
Wyll,I meant the Gate! But you're always welcome for tea.
Wyll,Labour is the lifeblood of every city. Baldur's Gate would perish without its workers.
Wyll,Do you regret it?
Wyll,"I think it's a true shame, that your goddess doesn't allow for love."
Wyll,Not like you to keep something forever. 
Wyll,I saw you pressing a bunch of flowers the other day in a book.
Wyll,And yet your bed-pillow bears barely a smudge. You are a woman of many talents.
Wyll,"Shadowheart - the way you paint around your eyes, they look permanently cloaked in shadow."
Wyll,"Exactly. Not that I'm one to refuse the scenic route, but I think we need to hike it."
Wyll,"We're not taking a boat to Baldur's Gate, surely."
Wyll,I'm trying to decide on a title for this chapter of the Blade's adventures.
Wyll,'The Mysteries of the Monastery'. 'The Secret of the Crags'.
Wyll,So curious little Wyll tried to slip in. The guard spotted me straight away and dragged me by the collar back to my father.
Wyll,"He's useful, as the not-so-alive, not-quite-dead go."
Wyll,But the greatest villains I've faced as the Blade? They look more like you and me than they do the beasts of my fantasies.
Wyll,"The monsters of my play-fights were strong, vicious. Trolls with hulking muscles, werewolves with sharpened fangs."
Wyll,Spent a lot of time in this park as a boy battling imaginary monsters.
Wyll,"I really hope you're being careful with our friend, Minthara. I wouldn't want you to break each other."
Wyll,"Yeah, but you... you're Minsc. "
Wyll,"Our great adventure nears its climax. If I should fall, I want you all to know it's been an honour to fight beside you. "
Wyll,Hm. What's plain to you wasn't so plain to mini-Wyll.
Wyll,How was I to know what went on behind its closed doors?
Wyll,"When I was a child, father sent me to Sharess' Caress to deliver messages."
Wyll,Maybe githyanki and humans aren't so different after all.
Wyll,Tombstones. I'd half-expect to get a glimpse of Withers here.
Wyll,"Even if you and our friend ended up having werewolf cubs, they'd be so adorable."
Wyll,I was barely eight years of age when I heard the Counting House held mythical treasure. 
Wyll,"Mercenary they may be, but father always demanded discipline from the Flaming Fist. Seems some grew unruly in his absence."
Wyll,"I've been pacted for seven years on, Gale. I should be able to read between Mizora's lines by now, no matter how narrow the gap."
Wyll,"I wager you're right. Ah, Gale - what a pleasure to see a genius' mind at work."
Wyll,I doubt a few iron bars are sufficient to hold one of Zariel's.
Wyll,"This is it, Gale - today, we annihilate the heart of the Absolute's power. The bards will sing of our victory here."
Wyll,And if we don't find any clear weakness?
Wyll,"This is no aimless horde - the Absolute's forces are organised. What do you make of it, Gale?"
Wyll,I've always relied on the kindness of the healers and menders of the Coast. Better a cleric's healing touch than a chirurgeon's scalpel.
Wyll,This was a hospital? Feels more like a prison.
Wyll,"Here, a bottle is judged more by its ability to crack heads than the quality of its contents."
Wyll,"It might seem a bit ramshackle, but this place has a boastworthy bar."
Wyll,"Between the orb and the bug, you've got more than your fair share of unwelcome passengers."
Wyll,"I admire your courage, Gale."
Wyll,Ethel mentioned Netherese magic. What in blazes does that mean?
Wyll,"The people aren't stupid, Astarion - they're scared. Gortash provoked a damned war, and then promised them safety."
Wyll,The city fell under Gortash's charms without him casting nary a spell.
Wyll,"Astarion, how is the rat diet going?"
Wyll,"Come, Astarion. I know you're not really as heartless as all that."
Wyll,"To think how vibrant this place must have once been. Children playing, merchants hawking. Real people living real lives."
Wyll,You had the most precious thing - someone who would do everything for you - and you damn well took everything. 'Degenerate' doesn't half cut it.
Wyll,The two of you are the unholiest union I can bloody imagine.
Wyll,"No, I mean it. There's little between us we share. But you've fallen in love and stood by your lover. That is something this dreamer's heart can appreciate."
Wyll,Seven years. Seven years of hunting the monsters of the Sword Coast - and seven years of Mizora's tight leash.
Wyll,And seven years of wondering if I'd ever rid myself of her - or if I even should.
Wyll,"You're an impressive fighter, Gale. You should consider a new name."
Wyll,"'The Wizard Wonder!' Or how about, 'The Master of the Weave'?"
Wyll,"I think he meant to comfort me. But I shivered for weeks, thinking I was being hounded by wide-eyed spirits."
Wyll,"When I was very young, father told me the dear ones we lose are quiet - but ever watchful."
Wyll,No signs of life - but the spirits of the past still linger here.
Wyll,"Not wise enough to avoid Sharran sanctums, apparently."
Wyll,The statuary in here is so triumphal. Even the worst of us can see ourselves as heroes.
Wyll,"That's right - you were there, weren't you?"
Wyll,My boyhood texts claimed bodies from this battle drifted downriver for a week.
Wyll,Hm. Good question.
Wyll,"Do you actually do anything besides meditate, counsel, fight, train, and make love?"
Wyll,"Halsin, tell me about the man behind the hulking wall of muscle."
Wyll,And you think the Harpers are more dutiful?
Wyll,And I don't get the sense that my father was being literal.
Wyll,"Now, a mere werebear could swat me halfway to Amn."
Wyll,Was a time I tussled with hill giants without breaking a sweat.
Wyll,"Monsters, I can fight. But I can no more sever these shadows than I could the wind or the sun."
Wyll,"Frustrating, that."
Wyll,What a dismal forest. Monsters could be lurking behind any and every tree.
Wyll,But Gale - you are so much more tolerable now you've found your second. 
Wyll,I used to believe the beauty of first love was unable to be surpassed.
Wyll,"Where are we going with this, Gale?"
Wyll,"I can recognise a troll's silhouette on a far horizon, but I wouldn't know a flirtation if you whacked me alongside the head with it."
Wyll,I think I'm not the right person to be asking.
Wyll,Father always shooed me away from this place. 'More rats than a Waterdeep dungeon.'
Wyll,You aren't actually insufferably randy. You're just insufferable.
Wyll,"Hm. Buy me some protective gloves, and I'm all for it. "
Wyll,"I'm reminded of a book father kept hidden in a drawer. 'The Salty Mermaid'. Do you know of it, Shadowheart?"
Wyll,"Indeed? My heart is joyed to hear it, but... why?"
Wyll,I see. Well -
Wyll,But no use dwelling on might-have-beens. I am proud to call you ally. I hope you can say the same.
Wyll,But no use dwelling on might-have-beens. I am proud to call you ally. Prouder still to call you friend.
Wyll,"But it was nice thinking about what might have been, if fate had chosen differently."
Wyll,"I even had a special night planned, just you and me. But priorities tend to drift in times as tough as these."
Wyll,"You lent an ear when I most needed one. And when I shared my fears, you didn't judge me."
Wyll,"I thought of the possibility more than once, if you must know."
Wyll,Gifts burned into my memories. I wouldn't give them up for the world.
Wyll,"Thank you. For the dance, for your understanding, and making a fantasy become reality - even if just for a moment."
Wyll,I - I understand. All the more fool am I for pressing my fortunes.
Wyll,You shine brighter than diamond and strike harder than steel. A rare treasure. Don't you ever forget it.
Wyll,It feels good to hear it. Almost as good as the touch of your hand and the glow of your smile.
Wyll,Is that what you want?
Wyll,"Choose Halsin, and our story may still be an epic - but it won't be a romance."
Wyll,"I might share a bowl of venison stew with Halsin, but never a partner in dance."
Wyll,"Halsin, you mean. I've seen the longing in your eyes. You've looked at me like that before, too."
Wyll,I won't entertain the notion. We must save him - it's as simple as that.
Wyll,You're not mistaken. Ravengard is - an important figure to the city. Should he die...
Wyll,"Otherwise, I'd bet my last coin that the Open Hand Temple in Baldur's Gate could help - though a fat lot of good that does us now. "
Wyll,We should pay her a visit.
Wyll,Seems unusual to me.
Wyll,"All the more reason to stick close, I think you'll agree."
Wyll,"Anger, I understand. We've been preyed on by illithids, suffered insertion of a mind-bending worm."
Wyll,"Bloodthirst is another matter. But perhaps not too big of one, if it's a devil or demon's flesh you're wanting to tear."
Wyll,Better that than the alternative.
Wyll,"- but that's not a lesson that needs repeating, I wager."
Wyll,And now you carry doom itself within you as penance. My father would lecture you on the perils of power-lust -
Wyll,Ah - you drank of the goblet of godhood. Not even a dwarf could distil a liquor more addictive.
Wyll,"I appreciate the honesty, at least. With Shar's dagger so near, I'll know to guard my back."
Wyll,"I've known only a few Sharrans - callous souls, every one of them."
Wyll,"So it's the Dark Lady who's shadowed your heart, is it? I might have guessed."
Wyll,"But you, Shadowheart - your darkness is gilded in silver. Keep your trust in me, and I'll keep mine in you."
Wyll,"So you're one of Shar's faithful. I've known only a few - callous souls, every one of them."
Wyll,"When the Absolute falls, I wager our alliance falls with it."
Wyll,"From what I understand, there's a healer called Nettie in the grove. Perhaps she's got the talent."
Wyll,"It's the pride you take in it, as if you've done all sixteen planes a great favour."
Wyll,"I'm so glad to hear it. If I had a bottle of Dragondew, I'd open it in your honour."
Wyll,"They burned away their own darkness with their own inner light. They chose courage, they chose honour - and so can you."
Wyll,"Listen to me. I knew another like you - Gorion's Ward, one of Baldur's Gate's great heroes. Bhaal's blood ran through their veins too."
Wyll,Hells - it explains so much.
Wyll,"Gods - you left Last Light for the shadows to feed on. You should be shamed for your villainy, not extolled for it."
Wyll,Don't bother answering - I already know.
Wyll,Hells. Is this really what you've become - the kind of monster I once vowed to slay?
Wyll,You don't.
Wyll,"Whichever is true, I will not stand for more innocent blood being shed in our camp."
Wyll,Is that so? Maybe that's fear of false accusation I hear in your voice. Or maybe it's guilt.
Wyll,By the gone gods. It isn't the blood you've spilled or the lives you've snuffed out that horrify me most.
Wyll,"What's your gripe with Selûne anyway, Shadowheart?"
Wyll,"I've come to know a fair few village clerics, but none with the skill to pull these worms from our heads."
Wyll,"But there's no use lingering on 'maybes'. My mind is on the stories of today and tomorrow, not those of yesterday."
Wyll,"We may never be dance partners. But we have fellowship, and I wouldn't trade that for all the gold in the Gate Counting House."
Wyll,"I was imagining my younger days, prancing about without a care in the world."
Wyll,I'm sorry. I might have come on a little strong with the dance invitation.
Wyll,I can't use this at the moment.
Wyll,Back to camp. The sooner the better.
Wyll,Now's not the time. I need a breather.
Wyll,I need to think.
Wyll,"I'm all chatted out, I'm afraid - though I may have a word with the chief."
Wyll,And we must find this captured devil. Two missions. One destination.
Wyll,We can't let the Absolute taint my father's mind.
Wyll,"Seek out the drider. Crush it like the vermin it is, and let the way to Moonrise open."
Wyll,Let's talk.
Wyll,I can't use that when I'm in battle.
Wyll,Mizora... Zariel's servant...
Wyll,Warlock... Hells' powers...
Wyll,Devil... patron... Zariel's servant...
Wyll,Freedom from Mizora...
Wyll,My father...
Wyll,Fight monsters... protect the Sword Coast...
Wyll,Wyll Ravengard... the Blade of Frontiers...
Wyll,"' 'Taste me', Allura pleaded. Fabian smashed his lips against hers and their tongues twisted together like two eels in the Sword Sea.'"
Wyll,Well - that's enough sentiment for one day. What did you need?
Wyll,Certainly.
Wyll,"I'm here for you, always."
Wyll,"Gods be damned. With that parasite in his brain, father could wreak untold havoc in the Absolute's name."
Wyll,Maybe I'd be living in the city. Maybe I'd never have been forced into this cursed pact.
Wyll,"Now, well - I'd be lying if I said I'd never thought about my mother. What life would've been like if she'd lived."
Wyll,"As a boy, my bond with father was too deep to miss the mother I never had."
Wyll,Because there's nothing to tell. She died when I was born.
Wyll,"The deeper we dig, the closer we get."
Wyll,"Not in a mere prison cell, certainly. My guess? Thorm will have confined him in the bowels of the tower."
Wyll,"I don't remember much beyond that. But where these 'Chosen' are concerned, I have a suspicion we're about to know more than we'd like."
Wyll,"A bit player with dreams of a leading role, the way father told it. He had no use for Gortash, and even less for his 'advice'."
Wyll,The Absolute's army's on the march. Gods forbid a tadpoled Grand Duke throw open the gates for them.
Wyll,It serves as headquarters for the Flaming Fist - and their commander: my father.
Wyll,It's a first.
Wyll,Wyrm's Rock fortress. All travellers to Baldur's Gate flow through it.
Wyll,And I am Wyll Ravengard. A memory of a memory. A man who belongs to the past.
Wyll,I am the Blade of Frontiers. A man hunting the fiends who prey on the weak and claw at the Coast.
Wyll,I am a man of two faces.
Wyll,I know. I should've told you sooner.
Wyll,Suelto is the one you should strike.
Wyll,Suelto's Ethic of War would lead to endless conflict. No city could survive it.
Wyll,"The Blade of Frontiers, at your calling."
Wyll,"The Astral Plane. Beautiful, otherworldly - and ever-so-slightly unnerving."
Wyll,"We're not just fighting for our cure. We're fighting for my father, we're fighting for the Gate, we're fighting for all of Faerûn."
Wyll,"Should Baldur's Gate fall to the Absolute, every one of the Coast's cities will be ripe for the plucking."
Wyll,"I wanted you to know the Blade, not the shadow he left behind."
Wyll,I know better than to be disappointed in you - that ship has long sailed the Sea of Swords. 
Wyll,No - I'm disappointed in me. For believing you were any different than what you always showed yourself to be.
Wyll,"The Beloved Ranger. I - I can't believe it. I grew up hearing all about your brave deeds. And Boo's, of course."
Wyll,"And from the smell of it, you're in the same condition."
Wyll,"My love! Oh gods, I smell like a seventy-year-old cinder."
Wyll,"Gods, I smell like a seventy-year-old cinder."
Wyll,I long for you every moment I'm away.
Wyll,"Or a single drop of wine, for that matter. I plan on downing at least half a bottle. Oops - did I say half a bottle? I meant half a dozen."
Wyll,"Now go on, the night's young. You shouldn't waste a moment of it."
Wyll,"My heart is still yours. And so it will be, until time stops and the planes split to pieces."
Wyll,"I miss you. Tonight, I toast not just the people we've become -"
Wyll,"I wish you'd come with me. Do battle together, just like the old days."
Wyll,You presume right.
Wyll,Anything else on your mind? I'm an open book - if a bit scorched at the edges.
Wyll,"Understandable - given the chance, I could yammer all night!"
Wyll,"That ranger's left a mountain of corpses in his wake and collected a tale or two. You'd indulge him one, yes?"
Wyll,"Till then, I'll keep sinking my blades into every fiend with its eyes trained on the Sword Coast. And I've got a story for each and every one."
Wyll,"You'll have to choose one tale and one tale only, I'm afraid, or I'll be yammering all night!"
Wyll,"Yes! But just the one, or I'll be yammering all night."
Wyll,Tossed a handful of gold pieces and they scattered. A flurry of arrows dropped them before they could grab a single coin.
Wyll,"Slit their necks for good measure. The damn things may be stupid, but they're sturdy, and I wasn't in the mood for nasty surprises."
Wyll,"Tossed a handful of gold pieces and they scattered. I summoned a few stinking clouds, and they dropped before grabbing a single coin."
Wyll,"Good thing for me, I'd learned every goristro's weakness: they're dumb as bugbears on a bender. Throw something shiny, and they'll chase it."
Wyll,"At least, until I caught their eye. I wasn't the hunter anymore. I was the hunted - and they were the first to land a blow. Hoof to the back, left a right nasty scar."
Wyll,"Well, never mind that. By the living gods, Karlach, It's so good to see you."
Wyll,"Not just a pair but a pack. Demonkin with no business treading the Hells. Seems they had sights on a paeliryon, one of Zariel's spies -"
Wyll,I can hardly believe we haven't crossed paths. I wager you've cracked open more than your share of hell-heads.
Wyll,"Well, never mind that. By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you."
Wyll,"Forgive me, Mother Superior - by the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you."
Wyll,Cast every doubt from your mind. The Moonmaiden doesn't shine her light on the unworthy.
Wyll,"In Avernus, there is no end to them. The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've bled - the stories I could tell."
Wyll,"You walk a righteous path, Shadowheart. And I wager you don't shy from righteous battles."
Wyll,You never were one to shy from battle - or to deny its thrills.
Wyll,Does Selûne still bless your path?
Wyll,"Well, never mind that. By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you, Shadowheart."
Wyll,I suppose you've been slinking in the night for the occasional feast.
Wyll,"A pity you can't be there for the hellhunt; you'd grow fat from infernal drippings. The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've gutted - the stories I could tell."
Wyll,"I suppose a Vampire Ascendant has no time for battle, if a healthy taste for blood."
Wyll,"Well, never mind that. By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you, Astarion."
Wyll,"Well, never mind that. By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you, Gale."
Wyll,"Me, I'm bound to the hellhunt. The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've bled - the stories I could tell."
Wyll,"No time or inclination to get your divine hands dirty in battle, I wager. What different lives we've come to lead."
Wyll,"Well, never mind that. By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you. And you look every bit the god that you are."
Wyll,"My thrill is the hellhunt. The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've bled - the stories I could tell."
Wyll,"I, uh - I'll have to take your word for it, but I won't question it."
Wyll,"The hellhunt is both duty and thrill. The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've bled - the stories I could tell."
Wyll,"I'm sorry. I promise, your sacrifice has not gone forgotten. It's afforded me a life of my own making: hunting and hellslaughter."
Wyll,Your sacrifice has not gone forgotten. It's afforded me a life of my own making: hunting and hellslaughter.
Wyll,"But dammit all, you are too bold a soul to be slinking in shadows."
Wyll,"Electrifying, isn't it? The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've bled - the stories I could tell."
Wyll,"And then it charged, splitting the ground with every thud, so fast it left a trail of smoke. I could barely nick it - not with a blade, not with an arrow."
Wyll,"Or waste a single drop of wine, for that matter. I plan on downing a half a bottle myself. Oops - did I say half a bottle? I meant half a dozen."
Wyll,"Go on, the night's young. You shouldn't waste a moment of it."
Wyll,"How you'd thrill in the hellhunt, Lae'zel. Slaying fiends is electrifying. The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've bled - the stories I've been itching to tell."
Wyll,"Diplomacy - not so different from fighting, I find. You still grip your blade, you just hide it beneath a silken glove."
Wyll,Withers yanked me from Avernus with my blade halfway through a cambion's belly without so much as a chance at a washing up.
Wyll,Phew - probably for the best. I smell like a seventy-year-old cinder.
Wyll,"A great Warrior of the Comet walks among us! Well - a projection of them, at least."
Wyll,"A great Warrior of the Comet walks among us! Well - a projection of him, at least."
Wyll,"A great Warrior of the Comet walks among us! Well - a projection of her, at least."
Wyll,"The great warrior Lae'zel walks among us! Well, a projection of her, at least."
Wyll,"There you are, my friend. Breathe deep. Can you smell it?"
Wyll,"You don't know what you're missing. The sweetness of honeysuckle, the earthiness of splitting oak."
Wyll,No wonder. The three of us have felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns.
Wyll,"I swear, Karlach and I have felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns."
Wyll,"I swear, the three of us have felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns."
Wyll,A far cry from the rancid Avernus heat that's been clogging my lungs.
Wyll,"There you are, my love. Breathe deep. Can you smell it?"
Wyll,"I miss you too. I'm glad you could, er, project your way in, or however it works."
Wyll,No wonder. Karlach and I have felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns.
Wyll,"I wager not. Well, probably for the best - I can smell only the sweet honeysuckle in the air. Karlach insists I reek with the blood of a hundred devils."
Wyll,"One of them sported a map and some blueprints. If you want all the gory details, Karlach can fill you in."
Wyll,"If those blueprints work, we might be able to fix Karlach - and she might be able to go home to Faerûn."
Wyll,"If those blueprints work, I could reverse engineer my stone eye. Instead of Mizora tracking me, I could track her."
Wyll,"Ah, I don't suppose you'd indulge me?"
Wyll,Yes - let's see how I compare to the fierce flame that is Karlach!
Wyll,"You'll have to choose one tale though, or I'll be yammering all night!"
Wyll,"You want to hear about the amnizu at the Styx, the three-tusked orthon, or the invading goristroi?"
Wyll,"Go on, my treasure, the night's young. You shouldn't waste a moment of it."
Wyll,"She's kept me on a long leash, if you can believe it."
Wyll,So I stoked new fires in myself using the lessons my father once taught me. The Blade of Avernus is a ranger - a hunter of the most hellish prey.
Wyll,I won't lie - losing the eldritch blasts and the hexes took some getting used to. Nothing but void where once there was hellfire.
Wyll,"The orthon slowly sunk, howling into the magma beneath. I let two of its tusks sink with it; the third I sliced free and presented to the First Duke of Daggerford, a rare trophy to grace his walls."
Wyll,"The third charge it made, I struck the rock with Hail of Thorns. The ground split apart the moment the beast stomped onto it."
Wyll,"The third charge it made, I struck the rock with Scorching Ray. The ground split apart the moment the beast stomped onto it."
Wyll,It was the wardevil's weight that proved its own undoing.
Wyll,"And then it charged, splitting the ground with every thud, so fast it left a trail of smoke. I could barely nick it - not with a blade, not with an eldritch blast."
Wyll,"It led to an isle of cracked rock in Avernus floating amid a molten sea. The orthon stood heaving, breath like brimstone and ash."
Wyll,"Truly Shar's favoured, as I understand. You exert your power from the shadows, away from the fields of battle."
Wyll,"It had travelled a hellrift to a long-forsaken shrine. Luckily, the trail it scorched into the frontiers was hard to miss."
Wyll,"When I'd finished, all that remained was a pair of paltry wings atop a pile of viscera."
Wyll,"I leapt free of the minion's grasp, unsheathed my shortswords, and rushed at the amnizu in a fury."
Wyll,But not even the Hells' minions are immune to a Circle of Death. And I had just enough strength left to conjure one.
Wyll,"When we'd finished, all that remained was a pair of paltry wings atop a pile of viscera."
Wyll,"She was just the distraction I needed. She nipped at the minion's heels and I leapt from its grasp, unsheathed my shortswords, and rushed at the amnizu in a fury."
Wyll,Good thing I never touch foot in the Hells without my companion wolf Lily.
Wyll,"Could feel the Styx tugging at my memories as I hung over it, eager to drink me dry."
Wyll,I felt my mind start to drain - an amnizu specialty. Bought just enough time for one of its minions to grab me and dangle me over the river.
Wyll,"Fat bastards, all of them. Was on the heels of a merregon who'd been stalking the Wild Hills and sprinted a little too close to the Styx."
Wyll,"Styx devils, they're called. They usually prefer the frozen wastes of Stygia, but Zariel's got a few of her own for guarding the River of Blood."
Wyll,Word travels fast when a devil crosses the Delimbiyr Vale near Daggerford.
Wyll,"Well, never mind that. By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you, Lae'zel."
Wyll,"So your blade is sharp as ever, Lae'zel of K'liir - to no one's surprise."
Wyll,"How you would thrill in the depths of Avernus. Slaying fiends is electrifying. The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've bled - the stories I could tell."
Wyll,"By the stars' light and the moon's glow, Gale - it's so good to see you. And you look every bit the god that you are."
Wyll,A different kind of hunt than I'm used to. But I know the thrill.
Wyll,"The hunt is both duty and thrill. The trolls I've torn open, the ghouls I've cleaved - the stories I've been itching to tell."
Wyll,"I'm sorry. I promise, your sacrifice hasn't gone forgotten. It's afforded me a life of my own making: slaying the beasts of the Coast."
Wyll,Your sacrifice hasn't gone forgotten. It's afforded me a life of my own making: slaying the beasts of the Coast.
Wyll,"But dammit all, you are too bold a soul to be slinking in shadows, tentacles or not."
Wyll,You look positively perfect - not a tentacle out of place.
Wyll,"The trolls I've torn open, the ghouls I've cleaved - the stories I've been itching to tell."
Wyll,I wager you've cracked open more than your share of hell-heads. You know the thrill of the hunt.
Wyll,"Karlach: You look positively perfect, and only ever so slightly singed."
Wyll,"You look positively perfect, if a bit shimmery at the edges."
Wyll,Anything else on your mind? I'm not a man to keep secrets - not anymore.
Wyll,"Till then, I'll keep sinking my blades into every monster threatening the Sword Coast. And I've got a story for each and every one."
Wyll,"I tumbled away, shot it with arrows, and it crashed to the ground. I could have ended the battle there and then. But this was prey that deserved to be played with."
Wyll,The beast was a smoking heap of black-green scales once the battle was over. The elves and I sang songs and drank mead in celebration until their barrels went dry.
Wyll,"I tumbled away, cast Flesh to Stone, and it crashed to the ground. I could have ended the battle there and then. But this was prey that deserved to be played with."
Wyll,"I tried a sly approach, but the whelp saw me coming and up it flew. Poison poured from its mouth as it descended. "
Wyll,He was a big boy - but still a young'un. A wonder of the skies but a lumbering oaf on the ground.
Wyll,The damn dragon had turned the place into a slave camp before I arrived. Sordid beyond words.
Wyll,"Turns out, Old Gnawbone had kids. And one of them flew the roost and took to stalking a small elven enclave outside Kryptgarden Forest."
Wyll,'Claugiyliamatar'. 'Clog-ee-myalarfer'. 'Cloff-a-mother-f...' Whatever - let's call it Old Gnawbone.
Wyll,"Me, I'm bound to the hunt. The trolls I've torn open, the ghouls I've cleaved - the stories I've been itching to tell."
Wyll,"By the stars' light and the moon's glow, Gale - it's so good to see you."
Wyll,"By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you, Astarion."
Wyll,"A pity you can't join me in open hunt. The trolls I've torn open, the ghouls I've cleaved - the stories I've been itching to tell."
Wyll,"As I feared - there is no place in your company for me. I want no part of this, or of you."
Wyll,"As I feared - there is no place in your company for us. We want no part of this, or of you."
Wyll,"Oh, but she seems such a delight! Let her stay, at least for the night."
Wyll,She seeks a safe haven. What sort of earsgang would refuse it?
Wyll,"Ease your worries, warm your hands. We owe you that much."
Wyll,Indestructible? We'll see about that.
Wyll,Ready yourself. Raphael won't give up his treasure without a fight.<br>
Wyll,"Not to sound like a second-rate writer, but - are you sure this is a good idea?"
Wyll,"Well. If you must indulge, might I suggest some place more secluded next time?"
Wyll,"You fought, and you prevailed. Your future will be what you make of it."
Wyll,"And as long as I'm more useful as a warlock, that's not a risk Mizora would take."
Wyll,"Think carefully. Do not give yourself to the Dread Lord, no matter how strong your cravings."
Wyll,"I thought I'd saved you from Bhaal's clutches. Seems I failed, damn it all."
Wyll,"Two Chosen down, one still to go. Shall we pay a visit to Gortash?"
Wyll,We should pay Gortash a visit. Let's see if he keeps his word.
Wyll,It's so good to see you - and I've got so much to tell!
Wyll,Lae'zel: You look positively perfect.
Wyll,"Me, I've seen no end to them. The trolls I've torn open, the ghouls I've cleaved - the stories I've been itching to tell."
Wyll,"Shar's true favoured, exerting power from the shadows, away from the fields of battle."
Wyll,Shadowheart: you look positively perfect.
Wyll,"If only you could join me. The trolls I've torn open, the ghouls I've cleaved - the stories I've been itching to tell."
Wyll,"By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you, Shadowheart."
Wyll,I will mourn the person you were. But I will not accept the one you've become.
Wyll,"One of them sported a map and some blueprints. If you want all the gory details, Karlach can fill you in. But get this:"
Wyll,I'd fall on my own blade and join the Blood War in an instant should Zariel's Hells-touched fingers stretch towards the Coast.
Wyll,"My next mark's the most challenging yet, or so she says. I don't know much more, only that it's no demon - but a devil."
Wyll,"Rylen sure didn't. Wasn't a month before the place was overrun by rampaging stegos. The Great Readers dealt with five of them without too much trouble. The remaining one, well..."
Wyll,Did you know it takes three tendays for a hatchling stegosaurus to reach the size of a cave bear?
Wyll,The wizard in question was called Rylen. Had a half-dozen eggs smuggled into Candlekeep from the jungle.
Wyll,"Wizards have a penchant for unusual pets, as you very well know. A flying cat? Delightful. A menagerie of dinosaurs, on the other hand..."
Wyll,"You want to hear about the stegosaurs that bullied Candlekeep, the impossible lich, or the young dragon who crawled out of Deeping Cave?"
Wyll,"How you'd thrill in the Blade's hunt, Lae'zel. The trolls I've torn open, the ghouls I've cleaved - the stories I've been itching to tell."
Wyll,You look positively perfect. If a bit shimmery around the edges.
Wyll,How about I change the subject before I dig this hole any deeper?
Wyll,"Gods, I must look a mess. I'd just rolled out from under a pesky ogre when Withers yanked me in."
Wyll,"Understandable. First six devils, then sixteen, sixty, six-hundred. All that remains is a trail of gore."
Wyll,Thank the Abyss that they're as stupid as they are greedy. Throwing those coins was a stroke of sheer genius.
Wyll,I'll never forget its howls as it sank into the magma.
Wyll,But you stoked new fires in me. The Blade of Avernus is now the ranger he was destined to be.
Wyll,"The Hells fear your name - and the Sword Coast hails it. My lover, my legend."
Wyll,"You were amazing. When it was over, all that remained was a pair of paltry wings atop a pile of viscera."
Wyll,"By the Nine Hells, think of the stories we could tell. The demons we've disintegrated, the devilkin we've bled."
Wyll,"Speaking of, I've got new stories to tell you - demented devils, demons turned to gore."
Wyll,"The hellhunt's no mere duty - it's a thrill. The demons I've disintegrated, the devilkin I've bled - the stories I could share."
Wyll,"Oh, forget all that. By the stars' light and the moon's glow, it's so good to see you - and I've got so much to tell you!"
Wyll,"Yet a warrior's heart still beats within you, Lae'zel of K'liir. It's as plain as the stars in this very sky."
Wyll,"Yet a warrior you remain, Lae'zel of K'liir - to no one's surprise."
Wyll,"... young Rylen cast Enlarge on it by mistake. The beast rampaged through the baths, demolished Oghma's temple, and smashed through the east wall."
Wyll,"Stegos may not have much taste for meat, but they've got a hell of a temper. Luckily, this one had only clobbered a few farmhouses once I'd caught up."
Wyll,The ground shook as it charged me. I vaulted over the beast and grabbed it by the tail. It bucked and bellowed as I climbed its plates and straddled its head.
Wyll,"I plunged a blade into the left eye, straight to the brain. It fell to the ground with a thud; bet the ravens are still picking at its carcass to this day."
Wyll,She's kept her leash loose - though I've been no stranger to the Hells.
Wyll,"We meet in a tenday. If the diabolist's right, the eye could lead me right to Mizora. It's past time her old pet gets to sink in his fangs."
Wyll,"If my patron could use it to track me, we might be able to track her. Or so the theory goes."
Wyll,"I'm in contact with a diabolist out in Calimshan, an expert on devils and their infernal tricks. And she's got some thoughts about my ol' sending stone of an eye."
Wyll,"She's kept herself hidden, the wily arsehole that she is. But turns out, there's a way I could find her."
Wyll,And he's back in his element - commanding the Flaming Fist with brave heart and no shortage of empathy.
Wyll,"He's leading the city's renewal, opened the Gates to all newcomers, rebuilt the Council from scratch."
Wyll,I've seen him more than a few times. And he's as proud of me as I am of him.
Wyll,"Now the Blade of Frontiers is a ranger - a true hunter of monsters, a warden in more than just name."
Wyll,So I stoked new fires in myself using the lessons my father once taught me.
Wyll,"She's playing a game. I don't know what it is, or how she plans to win. But I can tell you this much:"
Wyll,"I suppose that's my way of saying I miss you. Tonight, I toast not just the people we've become -"
Wyll,"I raged through the night. By morning, the fields were buried in shards of bone, the lich's included."
Wyll,"Ah, but what does a world of Netherbrains and magic crowns care about the impossible?"
Wyll,"I cast and carved until I reached the light. I found no caravan, but a sickly-green lich. Each fallen bone was a shard of its essence. An impossibility!"
Wyll,I turned my skin to bark and made for the light. The bones clumped and clattered into unspeakable aberrations.
Wyll,I shielded myself with Armour of Agathys and made for the light. The bones clumped and clattered into unspeakable aberrations.
Wyll,"It was as if a thousand skeletons were walking the skies and had split into pieces. Skulls, knuckles, ribs rained down on me."
Wyll,A deluge of bone.
Wyll,"I'd made camp south of Daggerford. The night was calm, lit by the green lanterns of a caravan. I was about to dig into a hearty stew when it began:"
Wyll,"It did - though the adventure had peaceful beginnings, as so many often so."
Wyll,"Wizards have a penchant for unusual pets. A flying cat? Delightful. A menagerie of dinosaurs, on the other hand..."
Wyll,"I wish you'd been there to join in! Oh, to battle together, just like the old days."
Wyll,"Well, that's enough hell-talk for the moment. The night's young. You shouldn't go wasting it."
Wyll,"I'm not worried, not when Karlach's got my back. I swear she could scare the eyes off a beholder."
Wyll,"I'm not worried, not when you both have my back. I swear you two could scare the eyes off a beholder."
Wyll,"I've had so little time to stop and notice life's small wonders. Turns out, rebuilding a city requires more than a simple wave of a duke's hand."
Wyll,"You don't know what you're missing. The sweetness of honeysuckle, the earthiness of split bark."
Wyll,"Turns out, rebuilding a city requires more than a simple wave of a duke's hand."
Wyll,"Oh, how right you are, and how wonderful it is. I've had so little time for simple pleasures like this in the two months past."
Wyll,"I haven't visited since the Absolute fell. Turns out, rebuilding a city requires more than a simple wave of a duke's hand."
Wyll,"I wish we'd caught up before now, but time is so fleeting. If only I could rebuild the city with a wave of the hand."
Wyll,"Still as charismatic as ever, I'd hasten to add."
Wyll,"Dammit, Astarion! Honeysuckle and jasmine hang in the air, and you're still thinking of open wounds and dripping cadavers."
Wyll,I - hold on a moment. *Sniff.* Do you smell that?
Wyll,"Gods, it's so good to see you. It's been far too long."
Wyll,"Astarion, you charming little bloodsucker. It's been far too long."
Wyll,"Gods, it's good to see you, Gale. It's been far too long."
Wyll,"Our great gith warrior. Gods, it's so good to see you."
Wyll,"Gods, it's good to see you, Shadowheart."
Wyll,"Gods, it's good to see you. Tentacles and all."
Wyll,"My own blade's dulled a bit, I'm afraid. Unless you count the boars I've slain on ceremonial hunts, I haven't felled a single beast since the Absolute fell."
Wyll,"My edge may not be so sharp as yours, but I still slip away for a hunt when I can. My heart is never far from the frontiers."
Wyll,Not to mention the mightiest magic you can muster and the sharpest swords you can forge.
Wyll,I am no stranger to it myself. A city is not rebuilt with the simple wave of a duke's hand.
Wyll,"Ah, diplomacy - not so different from fighting, I find. You still grip your blade, you just hide it beneath a silken glove."
Wyll,"Rebuilding a city requires a politic mind. A sharp soldiering blade, not so much."
Wyll,"Bargains must be made, alliances must be forged, customs must be considered."
Wyll,"Lae'zel, my love, my heart. Breathe deep - can you smell it?"
Wyll,"Astarion, my love, my heart. Breathe deep - can you smell it?"
Wyll,"Shadowheart, my love, my soul. Breathe deep - can you smell it?"
Wyll,"Right you are. But even tonight, beneath the Tears of Selûne, the city isn't far from my mind."
Wyll,"And you will rise victorious, Lae'zel of K'liir, as you always do. I wish I could join you, but my focus must remain on the Gate."
Wyll,"I could never doubt you, Lae'zel of K'liir - I only wish I could join you. My focus must remain on the Gate."
Wyll,What word from the scouts? Have we finally rid ourselves of the githyanki threat?
Wyll,"I'm glad father's left us to our own devices, more or less - though he's got no shortage of advice when I ask for it."
Wyll,I miss you too. If only ducal life afforded me more time.
Wyll,"Go on, the night's young. I don't plan on wasting a moment of it."
Wyll,I love you. Don't ever forget that.
Wyll,"It's so freeing, to be together like this outside the confines of the shadows."
Wyll,"Of course, she took my every last hex and fiendish power along with her. Took some getting used to. They left behind a cold abyss where fire once raged."
Wyll,"I'm afraid since we last met, my corpse count remains a paltry zero. Unless you count the boars I've felled on ducal hunts."
Wyll,She hasn't dared flash her wings since we crushed the Netherbrain and freed the infected.
Wyll,Your hunger requires sating. And I mean to provide.
Wyll,"I... I know, and I can help. I've made contact with an assassin, name of Artemis, a killer of killers. Certain arrangements can be made."
Wyll,"Oh, before I forget - I've made contact with an assassin, name of Artemis, a killer of killers. Certain arrangements can be made."
Wyll,And yet deserve so much more.
Wyll,Have you been... comfortable in the Undercity? Is there anything more I can bring you?
Wyll,You've been patient through it all. Your love is the fuel that drives me forward.
Wyll,"Instead, I must devote myself to political bargains, forging alliances, keeping to custom."
Wyll,Time is so precious. If only I could rebuild the city with a wave of the hand.
Wyll,I hoped you would remember. Can you believe we haven't been there since that very eve?
Wyll,"My love, my heart. Breathe deep - can you smell it?"
Wyll,How I wish I could show you off in the High Hall instead of hiding you away. If only life were so simple.
Wyll,"I now serve only you and Baldur's Gate, not a devil of the First Hell."
Wyll,The hexes and eldritch blasts? Losing them took getting used to. They left behind a cold abyss where fire once raged.
Wyll,Though she does insist on joining diplomatic missions in human guise.
Wyll,"With a few exceptions, Eltan's pardoned every last Fist. 'Gortash led the parched Fist to Bane's bloody well. I refuse to punish the thirsty for drinking from it.' Her words, not mine."
Wyll,"Given the atrocities the Fist committed under Gortash, I expected her to thrash every last one. But she didn't do so much as scold them."
Wyll,I've entrusted the Fist to Cordula Eltan. Who better than a descendant of its founder to guide them?
Wyll,"Like my father, she believes in the bow and the blade. But she's teaching the Fist a new lesson:"
Wyll,"With a few exceptions, Florrick's pardoned every last Fist. 'I will not make them drink the poison of my own resentment.' Her words, not mine."
Wyll,"I've entrusted the Fist to Florrick. She commands the Flaming Fist with as brave a heart as ever, and delivered them nary a scolding or lashing."
Wyll,May they all take it to heart.
Wyll,"'Valour is found not in the wounds you inflict, but in the lives that you've bettered.'"
Wyll,He still believes in the bow and the blade. But he's teaching the Fist a new lesson:
Wyll,"He still believes in the bow and the blade. But with Florrick's help, he's teaching the Fist a new lesson:"
Wyll,"With a few exceptions, Father's pardoned every last Fist. 'If my forgiveness not be Tyr's will, so be it. I shall forgive them all the same.' His words, not mine."
Wyll,"Bane's Chosen primed the Fist for a war they weren't meant to win. He convinced them there was an assassin hiding in every shadow, that cruelty was the correct answer to crisis."
Wyll,"The likes of Gortash can bend people's minds with a few chosen words, no tadpole needed."
Wyll,"Father's back in his element - commanding the Flaming Fist with as brave a heart as ever, and delivered them nary a scolding nor lashing."
Wyll,I'm sure the Silvershields can make do without a few more jewelled crowns.
Wyll,"Amazing, what can be done when Parliament and the Council pressure the upper city elites to open their coffers."
Wyll,"We are building new housing - not just shanties, but homes where families can rest their heads, plant gardens, pursue happiness."
Wyll,"I do. Unlike your Sharrans, I strive to live in the light."
Wyll,"The Jewel of the Coast will shine ever bright, welcoming the weak and the weary, from wherever they hail."
Wyll,"Liara Portyr is now Grand Duke of the Wilds, Sickle of Chult."
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate is nothing without its citizens, both in the Upper and Lower. Our duty is to them, and only them."
Wyll,They've fallen under my command for the time being.
Wyll,I considered thrashing every last one of them for the fears they stoked in Gortash's name. But I didn't have the heart for so much as a scolding.
Wyll,So I pardoned every last one. Gortash led the parched Fist to Bane's bloody well. I refuse to punish the thirsty for drinking from it
Wyll,I still believe in the bow and the blade. But I'm teaching the Fist a new lesson:
Wyll,She hasn't ordered a single murder spree or any diabolical errands. She knows I'd sooner fall on my own sword than put the city in danger.
Wyll,Turns out she's kept me on a loose leash. 
Wyll,"You'd think she'd have made a mess at every turn, yeah?"
Wyll,And Mizora knows it.
Wyll,But I'll fall on my own blade and join the Blood War in an instant should Zariel's Hells-touched fingers stretch towards Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,"Whatever her game, I'm bound by her rules. My future'll never be fully my own."
Wyll,"- 'til Mizora pressed her lips to his ear. A whisper breathed, a bargain made."
Wyll,Her beauty and bargaining talents have even been a boon. Neverwinter's Lord denied me a boatful of his finest masons -
Wyll,She hasn't ordered any murder sprees or any diabolical errands. But she insists on joining diplomatic missions in human guise.
Wyll,"Mizora's kept me on a long leash, if you can believe it."
Wyll,Damn right.
Wyll,Yet we stay devoted. Such is the power of love.
Wyll,"Illithids hunt in the shadows. I can offer diversion, comfort, the pleasure of company..."
Wyll,Yes. Though our 'togetherness' isn't so 'together' as we'd like.
Wyll,"When I'm gone, the four pillars will live with her - courage, justice, insight, strategy. May they guide her down the path with the brightest star at its end."
Wyll,Four months of age at most - a mote of love in its purest form. She is perfection.
Wyll,The Crying God's faithful thought it a sign. They summoned me the very next day.
Wyll,"Lily Aurora Ravengard. Treasure of a girl, found at the entrance of the Open Hand Temple - one grey eye, one brown."
Wyll,Every moment we spend together is a joy. And it so happens that someone else has joined the family celebration.
Wyll,We danced until the sun threatened to peek above the horizon.
Wyll,"The night we married, the sky lit up with fireworks. My eyes are still filled with their glitter and gold."
Wyll,Every moment we spend together is a celebration.
Wyll,"... but I can only do so much to warm the chill of the Undercity. My beloved deserves the revel of a full life, not a haunted existence."
Wyll,Let's not forget the devil Karlach. The Coast is in danger for as long as she's loosed on it. We need to find her - and kill her.
Wyll,"Indeed he is - and with nary a lashing or scolding, to my surprise."
Wyll,It is to be reborn - a bettered council befitting a bettered city.
Wyll,"I used to climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the legends it might tell, if I listened close enough."
Wyll,Reminds me of the Wilden Oak. The oldest and most storied tree in all of the Sword Coast.
Wyll,"If those blueprints work, we won't just be able to fix up your heart - we could reverse engineer my stone eye."
Wyll,That's my Karlach. Loyal to a fault.
Wyll,"But we can't pass up the chance. If that forge map is real, we won't just be able to fix up your heart - we could reverse engineer my stone eye."
Wyll,"But we can't pass up the chance. Imagine it, to swim in the Chionthar again, to travel cobblestone roads, to set our heads on down pillows."
Wyll,"So what if it is? All of Avernus is a trap. One false move, you slip into the Styx, and poof - there go your memories.  "
Wyll,It always let Mizora track me - let's see if we can make it track her. It's past time for her old pet to sink in his fangs.
Wyll,"But we can't pass up the chance, Karlach. If that forge map is real, we won't just be able to fix up your heart - we could reverse engineer my stone eye."
Wyll,"But we can't pass up the chance, Karlach. Just imagine - swimming in the Chionthar again, travelling cobblestone roads, setting our heads on down pillows."
Wyll,"And not to pat myself too hard on the back, but I'm not such a bad ranger if I do say so myself."
Wyll,"Who needs hope, when we've got your axe and your courage?"
Wyll,"Oh - and before you saunter off: I love you. Hasn't changed, never will."
Wyll,"Or wasting any of the wine, for that matter. I plan on downing half a bottle myself. Oops - did I say half a bottle? I meant half a dozen."
Wyll,Well - how about we put the hunt out of our minds for now? The night's young. You shouldn't go wasting it.
Wyll,It always led Mizora to me - let's see if we can make it take us to her. It's past time for her old pet to sink in his fangs.
Wyll,"Just think - if that forge map is real, we won't just be able to fix up your heart, we could reverse engineer my stone eye."
Wyll,"Imagine swimming in the Chionthar again, travelling cobblestone roads, setting our heads on down pillows."
Wyll,"Just think - if those blueprints are right, we can fix your heart up once and for all."
Wyll,"Oh shit - I'm starting to pick up your bad habits. Well, fuck it. In for a coin, in for a coffer."
Wyll,"Fuck yeah, that's my girl!"
Wyll,But none of those legends I imagined were as spectacular as the ones we're writing for ourselves.
Wyll,You've felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns. 
Wyll,Almost as legendary as the warrior facing me now. Pretty sure you've felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns.
Wyll,"And no rancid rancid devil-blood clogging our noses, either. I'm sure you've spilled enough of it to flood the Great Avernus Road."
Wyll,"My next target's the most challenging yet, or so she says. I don't know much more, only that it's no demon - but a devil."
Wyll,"She's kept me on a long leash, if you can believe it. Every target she's set me on's been a demonic intruder - tanar'ri assassins who slip into Avernus, armanites that amass near the Styx."
Wyll,"Not to pat myself too hard on the back, but I'm not such a bad ranger if I do say so myself."
Wyll,I think the splinters I made out of the last bone devil I saw speak for themselves.
Wyll,"If I had to do it all over again - and I'd rather not, to be clear! - I can't imagine not having you at my side."
Wyll,"I've missed you too. The rush of battles we fought, the heart-to-hearts, the nights around the fire. The comfort of knowing I didn't face the unknown alone."
Wyll,"I've missed you too, Karlach. The most generous spirit, the fiercest heart. Diamond and cinder, forged into a precious treasure all on its own."
Wyll,"I've missed you too. And your cunning tongue, of course. And did I mention your hair? I might have missed that most of all."
Wyll,I've missed you too. You showed me that even in one who walks in the shadows might still shine her own light.
Wyll,"I've missed you too. You were always a fighter, in every sense of the word."
Wyll,Who would've thought that just one of them held the key to escaping Avernus for good?
Wyll,It's past time for her old pet to sink in his fangs.
Wyll,Who would have thought that just one of those fiends held the key to escaping Avernus for good?
Wyll,Karlach and I have felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns.
Wyll,"I'm proud of you, you know. It can't have been easy to turn your back on the lich you called queen."
Wyll,Limbo - realm of the githzerai? Then the rebellion's taken you far from the Astral.
Wyll,"Breathe, my friend. Can you smell it?"
Wyll,Lae'zel. I knew you'd find a way.
Wyll,No wonder. We've felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns. 
Wyll,Shit - dried devils' blood. Stinks like a skunk squatting in an aboleth's corpse.
Wyll,"By the good gods, how bad do I reek?"
Wyll,"You're a wonder, Karlach. You've felled enough cambions to build a fortress with their horns. "
Wyll,"And get this: If those blueprints we found work, I could reverse engineer my stone eye. Instead of Mizora tracking me, I could track her."
Wyll,"All for the good, I like to think - though I've met my fair share of challenges."
Wyll,"For you, I'd destroy every fiend in the deepest Hell. But I think you might just beat me to it."
Wyll,"Forest trees draped in moss. Bittersweet, smoky - and that faintest hint of vanilla."
Wyll,"Speaking of, I've got new stories to tell you. New trolls I've torn open, new ghouls I've cleaved."
Wyll,Your hunger requires sating. And it's not easy to smuggle the spoils of my hunts.
Wyll,"Gods, love - I must look a mess. I'd just rolled out from under a pesky ogre when Withers yanked me in."
Wyll,A welcome reprieve from the faraway missions and bargaining tables of the months past.
Wyll,We are among old friends under the twinkling stars. We've had too little time for pleasures like these.
Wyll,We are among old friends under the twinkling stars. Not since our wedding have we enjoyed an evening so jubilant.
Wyll,"Not the sweet honeysuckle, the heady jasmine? Oh, but what does it matter?"
Wyll,"Oh, how right you are, and how wonderful it is. We've had too little time for pleasures like these."
Wyll,"Oh, how right you are. Not since our wedding have we enjoyed an evening so jubilant."
Wyll,"Dammit, my love. Honeysuckle hangs in the air, and you're thinking of open wounds and dripping cadavers! Ah, but what does it matter?"
Wyll,That makes two of us - though losing the hexes and eldritch blasts took getting used to. They left behind a cold abyss where fire once raged.
Wyll,That makes two of us.
Wyll,"But tonight is for us - and Lily's only four months of age, besides. I promise, the Temple will keep her in good care."
Wyll,"Ah, the girl could melt the staunchest heart. She might even have brought a smile to old Withers' face!"
Wyll,"Go on, my love - the night's young. You shouldn't waste a moment of it."
Wyll,"I understand. But I am no less grateful for you, and for us. Without you at my side, this city wouldn't shine half as bright."
Wyll,The city's future looks brilliant indeed.
Wyll,"Then we've a reason to celebrate tonight twice over. Hail Grand Duke of the Coast, Doom of the Dead Three!"
Wyll,"Namely, I nominate you. Please say you'll accept."
Wyll,"And there's another I'd like to nominate - Grand Duke of the Coast, Doom of the Dead Three."
Wyll,"I am Wyll Ravengard, Grand Duke of the Wyrm, Heart of the Gate."
Wyll,Say you'll indulge me.
Wyll,I... I know.
Wyll,"But I've made contact with an assassin, name of Artemis, a killer of killers. Certain arrangements can be made."
Wyll,"I miss you too. I promise, I'll make more time."
Wyll,"Ah - there you are. Breathe, my friend. Can you smell it?"
Wyll,"Understandable. First a goblin, then a ghast, then a gorgon. One victory becomes ten becomes a hundred."
Wyll,"Singing songs, sipping mead with the elves we defended. I still carry their joy with me."
Wyll,"The battle was fierce, but it was the celebration after I most remember."
Wyll,"She's playing a game. I just don't know what it is, or how she plans to win."
Wyll,"Every target she's set me on's been a demonic intruder - tanar'ri assassins who slip into Avernus, armanites that amass near the Styx."
Wyll,Mizora wouldn't dare risk it as long as I'm more valuable as a warlock.
Wyll,I'd fall on my own blade and join the Blood War in an instant should she put you or the Sword Coast in danger.
Wyll,The woman's an expert on devils and their infernal tricks. And she's got some thoughts about my ol' sending stone of an eye.
Wyll,He's doing well. The rebuilding of Baldur's Gate continues apace.
Wyll,"Reminds me of the Wilden Oak, the acorn I gave you - and the promise I made."
Wyll,But you stoked new fires in me. The Blade of Frontiers is now the ranger he was destined to be.
Wyll,"Beasts and bandits alike fear your name - and the Sword Coast hails it. My lover, my legend."
Wyll,"But a victory all the same. Because of your courage, Daggerford still stands."
Wyll,"The two of us versus an army of skeletons, each one a piece of the lich's essence. An impossible victory, in hindsight."
Wyll,Took a brave soul to fell that damned beast. And I'm looking at them now.
Wyll,Took a brave soul to fell that damned stego. And I'm looking at him now.
Wyll,Took a brave soul to fell that damned stego. And I'm looking at her now.
Wyll,Can you believe that wizard had the gall to cast Enlarge on a dino? A miracle it only smashed up a few farmhouses.
Wyll,"You must have a favourite, yeah? A fight you still savour?"
Wyll,"By the Nine Hells, think of the stories we could tell. "
Wyll,And yet you - you look positively perfect. Almost as if you haven't slayed damn near a hundred bugbears these last few months.
Wyll,"Ah, but we should get back to the celebration. Unless there's something on your mind?"
Wyll,We will yet be Four. Until such time - and after - we will enact the will of the people's Parliament.
Wyll,"To Moonrise Towers, then. May the sun and stars guide us."
Wyll,"More incredible than the love we might have shared, the kingdom we might have built?"
Wyll,"Pull me too close, and I'm destined to hurt you."
Wyll,My father taught me more lessons than I can count. But perhaps the greatest one is this: a champion's heart's as sharp as a new blade.
Wyll,"And none of it shall go to waste, you have my solemn promise. But - truth be told, it's not just Baldur's Gate I'm protecting."
Wyll,"One monster slain, then. And another after that, and then another. There will always be one more evil to fell."
Wyll,Quite the opposite. I'd be getting in yours.
Wyll,Forever could only be a dream.
Wyll,But time caught up with me. Father is dead. Baldur's Gate nears its ruin. My one and only duty must be to the city.
Wyll,"Not so long ago, I was dreaming of our own personal forever, endless nights in each other's arms."
Wyll,Time is so godsdamned greedy. It races forward no matter how hard we rail against it.
Wyll,Time.
Wyll,Maybe. But I think the right answer is much simpler than that:
Wyll,But I've only now come to see who my true enemy's been.
Wyll,I've lived at the mercy of fiends - a devil's plaything trying to right the Coast's wrong.
Wyll,I live at the mercy of fiends. A devil's plaything awaiting a future in the Hells.
Wyll,"I live at the mercy of fiends. A man with the horrid face of a devil, awaiting his future in Hells' blistered army."
Wyll,"As the Blade, I've faced untold brutes and beasts. Together we've seen illithid horrors most souls could merely fathom."
Wyll,It's funny.
Wyll,"Then I hope the road rises to meet you, wherever it leads."
Wyll,'Maybe' is better than 'no' last I checked. I'll take it.
Wyll,"Friends it is. When your storms gather and lightning strikes, I'll come calling."
Wyll,I hope your queen values the treasure she has in you.
Wyll,I was thinking - how about one last dance. For old times' sake?
Wyll,"A shame. A warrior of your merits could cleanse the Coast of its monsters, and still have time to hunt supper."
Wyll,Maybe I can staunch it. Just - for a moment.
Wyll,I deserve that. And I'm sorry.
Wyll,"If that be so, then may my greatest wish come true tonight:"
Wyll,My mother always said the Wilden Oak's acorns held just a touch of wishing magic.
Wyll,And who I want at my side as it passes.
Wyll,"I've been thinking a lot about forever. Moreso, I've been thinking everything that comes before -"
Wyll,Me.
Wyll,I did. But also to see something else:
Wyll,Nor could it rival yours.
Wyll,"My favourite in all of the Coast. All of Faerûn, even. Not even the Sea of Stars could rival its magnificence -"
Wyll,I was hoping you'd think so.
Wyll,"Standing here, I feel like I can see into forever."
Wyll,The dragon lords sparking the skies above it. The moon elves first plucking the strings of the Weave.
Wyll,"I used to come here and climb it when father's eye was turned elsewhere - daydream of the stories it might tell, if I listened close enough."
Wyll,The Wilden Oak. Legend has it it's stood since the Age of Dawn.
Wyll,"Come, let me show you."
Wyll,If just for a moment.
Wyll,"Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop it -"
Wyll,It even comes for your people in the astral sea. Time may hunt slowly - but it still hunts.
Wyll,"We blink, and we're gone. And our hopes, our memories, our heart-bonds are gone with us."
Wyll,"It builds mountains and deserts, only to tear them asunder. It fells armies, it conquers kings, queens - even gods."
Wyll,"Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take. My eternal soul is at its mercy."
Wyll,"I'll leave you to your thoughts. I hope somewhere in them, you find peace."
Wyll,"One last dance, for old times' sake."
Wyll,I'm glad to hear that Karlach. Who would have thought my prey might become a good partner instead?
Wyll,"Now, let's rest. I wager tomorrow'll be a big day."
Wyll,"So deep, in fact, that I'd probably need more than one shovel."
Wyll,"Now go off, have your fun. I've got a tankard keeping me company."
Wyll,"Your heart beats strong, friend. I'm proud to fight at your side."
Wyll,"When the time comes to rest, just say the word and we'll meet at your bunk."
Wyll,You do know how to set the Blade's heart all a-flutter.
Wyll,It's a good thing I'm not jealous then.
Wyll,"Eh - go off, have your fun. I've got a tankard keeping me company."
Wyll,"Consider me jealous as a sisterless hag, then."
Wyll,And if I were?
Wyll,And to you and Astarion. May your stars burn ever bright.
Wyll,"Of course, of course. Why complicate such a valuable partnership?"
Wyll,"Of course, of course. Why complicate such a valuable friendship?"
Wyll,"Of course, of course. Our future holds countless victories to celebrate."
Wyll,"I hadn't imagined myself so subtle. Or, to put it another way: yes."
Wyll,I trust I won't have to wait long.
Wyll,Meet you at your bunk when you're ready.
Wyll,"If I didn't know better, I'd think you were reading my mind."
Wyll,I reckoned our union might extend to your bunk tonight.
Wyll,... but the frontier provides few of life's creature comforts.
Wyll,"Your heart beats strong, friend. The Blade rarely seeks partnership..."
Wyll,May our bond only grow stronger.
Wyll,"And of course, to us."
Wyll,"Your business is plain as a dread pirate's pikestaff, chief."
Wyll,And to you and Gale. May your stars burn ever bright.
Wyll,And to you and Karlach. May your stars burn ever bright.
Wyll,And to you and Lae'zel. May your stars burn ever bright.
Wyll,"Oh, Astarion. I bet I'd find a touch of sweet under all that sour, if I digged deep enough."
Wyll,"This might sound presumptuous, but I hope we'll stay allies once we're cured."
Wyll,We should rest these weary bones of ours.
Wyll,I'm glad to see you're not one to give up.
Wyll,"Slay your doubt, and nothing can stop you. Not a demon, not a dragon, and certainly not an illithid worm."
Wyll,Most people don't find it so easy to conquer. It's a good thing for us that we aren't 'most people'.
Wyll,"Doubt is the greatest villain we face. Greater than all the Hells' devils, greater than a murderous god."
Wyll,"'It's hopeless', it says. 'Stop resisting. Give up and give in.'"
Wyll,The doubt in our minds crying out for attention.
Wyll,"No, I was thinking of a far more loathsome sound:"
Wyll,"I love you. Will you be mine - today, and tomorrow, and reaching into eternity?"
Wyll,"Oh, the lad's quite the tease. But he's a charming sort of cad - well, most of the time."
Wyll,They do clack out a dreadful rhythm. But the one I'm thinking of is even more dire:
Wyll,"They screeched most horribly, yes - but I know of one even more ruthless:"
Wyll,I thought it the most terrible noise in all sixteen planes. But there's one even more fearsome than that.
Wyll,"Loud enough to wake the dead, and shrill enough to shatter a golden goblet."
Wyll,"Incredible, wasn't it? Loud enough to wake the dead, and shrill enough to shatter a golden goblet.<br>"
Wyll,"Mm - for the best that you haven't. An agonising wail. Loud enough to wake the dead, and shrill enough to shatter a golden goblet."
Wyll,Question for you: have you ever heard a banshee's scream?
Wyll,Cheers!
Wyll,And to you and your paramour. May your stars burn ever bright.
Wyll,And to you and Shadowheart. May your stars burn ever bright.
Wyll,"Not even close. I find them comforting, even. What I'm thinking of is far more malicious:"
Wyll,Gods. You've made me the happiest soul in all the Realms.
Wyll,"Get down here, already. It's time we started our happily-ever-after!"
Wyll,"I understand, truly. All I need is you. The rest is just details."
Wyll,"I'm tempted, trust me. I thought my heart might burst with every step."
Wyll,Well - it's getting late. We can't face the morrow if we don't bid farewell to the now.
Wyll,So much shadow around us. To think I almost missed the light.
Wyll,Now perhaps we might try a more - intimate style.
Wyll,Bravo. Bravo!
Wyll,Fair enough. Perhaps a less energetic style would suit you better.
Wyll,"Don't you worry, you were a joy to witness. But perhaps we might try a more intimate style."
Wyll,But perhaps we might try a more intimate style.
Wyll,"I'll show you everything I know, and then some - I promise."
Wyll,"But I count you as a friend. My closest, in all honesty. Please - dance with me. If we must burn with the Hells' fires, let us burn together."
Wyll,I deserve that. And I wish I could give more than 'sorry's in return.
Wyll,"Are you sure? I've been rehearsing, you know. I'd hate to put all that effort to waste."
Wyll,Our hearts can keep time.
Wyll,May I have this dance?
Wyll,"As luck would have it, they just arrived."
Wyll,"As luck would have it, he just arrived."
Wyll,"As luck would have it, she just arrived."
Wyll,"Oh! Sorry. I didn't see you standing there. Lost in the steps, truth be told."
Wyll,Figured it was time to brush up on my skills. I wouldn't want to fail my new partner.
Wyll,I've attended my share of fancy balls and masquerades. A few elegant moves can turn all the right heads.
Wyll,VO_SFX: Clearing his throat
Wyll,"But I still keep faith in the old tales of love, the once-upon-a-times and the happily-ever-afters."
Wyll,I'd like to do this the proper way. The way of the old romances sung by the bards.
Wyll,"Till next time, good night - and dream sweetly."
Wyll,"*Sigh.* I've drunk wines from Daggerford to Cormyr, but I've never known a taste as rich as yours."
Wyll,Maybe. But I'm not so keen to perform solo. A duet's always been more my style. Which is to say -
Wyll,I know a few people who might beg to differ. But the only one that matters is here with me now.
Wyll,"You've more than proven just how wrong I was about you. I'd make the same decision a thousand times, even knowing the consequences."
Wyll,It would be an honour.
Wyll,But you won't.
Wyll,"If you think you can put your hand in mine without singeing it off, I'm willing to try."
Wyll,"About that. You only burn hottest when your emotions are aflare, right? Anger, excitement, fear... but a dance can be meditative. Calming."
Wyll,"Good night, then."
Wyll,You don't have to be. Just follow my lead.
Wyll,Follow my lead.
Wyll,"Then goodbye it is. May the path rise to meet you, wherever it leads."
Wyll,"Bashful tonight, are we? Perhaps you will take to a more - relaxed style."
Wyll,How utterly charming!
Wyll,Indeed? Well let's see how you fare with a more - intimate style.
Wyll,"No need to be modest, you were a delight to behold."
Wyll,You have more control than you give yourself credit for.
Wyll,Forgive me. I was... caught up in the moment. But look - not a cinder on me.
Wyll,"Thank you. For the dance, I mean. I won't forget it."
Wyll,"I mean - yes, of course. The sun only rests for so long."
Wyll,Oh.
Wyll,"Good night. And thank you. For the dance, I mean. I won't forget it."
Wyll,Gods damn it. You almost make me forget myself.
Wyll,Does it now? Then let's see how you fare with a less - energetic style.
Wyll,Hmm - I'm not really feeling the connection.
Wyll,"The honour is mine. Consider my blade yours, 'til death makes me lay it down."
Wyll,I chased Karlach through the flames of Avernus. Her axe split the living and undead alike.
Wyll,"'Surprising' is just the word, isn't it?"
Wyll,"Ah, there it is - that shiver. Our little brain-worms have made fast friends, it would seem."
Wyll,I'd like to think not. The answer is much simpler than that:
Wyll,So you'd think. But the right answer is much simpler than that:
Wyll,"Time is so gods-damned greedy. It can never give, only take."
Wyll,"Lucky for us, I've found a way to stop time -"
Wyll,"Dance. And when you do, think of me."
Wyll,But do me one favour:
Wyll,"Understood. Your will is strong, and I would have it no other way."
Wyll,A toll of the bell - it's all I ask. Our problems can wait that long.
Wyll,It is. I promise.
Wyll,"All this time, and that's still what you see?"
Wyll,May you be granted every wish you ask for. You deserve each and every one.
Wyll,At least - take this.
Wyll,"Gods, I want you. But I can't take your body without taking your heart."
Wyll,But - I can't resist you. I'd sooner know one unforgettable night than a lifetime of 'what ifs'.
Wyll,"Ours is such a beautiful story, and this isn't the ending I wanted to write."
Wyll,"But I'm ready to live a thousand more, if you can bear me."
Wyll,"It is. I swear, I've lived a thousand lives since I've known you."
Wyll,Sit with me. It's time we started our happily-ever-after.
Wyll,"For now, let's enjoy this piece of eternity."
Wyll,"Before the illithids' unscheduled surgery, I'd felled hundreds of beasts and a fair few fiends."
Wyll,"The tadpole's weakened me, suppressed greater talents. But beyond that -"
Wyll,"I've shown no sign of turning. No nausea, no pain, not even a hot flash."
Wyll,"Not the best company to be sharing. Blessedly, their god's remained quiet to us."
Wyll,"I - no, my fellow. You've got it all wrong."
Wyll,You can just call me Wyll.
Wyll,"Some call me the Blade of Frontiers. Others, the Pride of the Coast, or the Protector."
Wyll,"I propose an alliance. We search for a cure; I pledge you my talents, and you pledge me yours."
Wyll,I haven't sprouted a tentacle just yet - but I'm thinking it's only a matter of time.
Wyll,"We've a lot in common, it seems. An aversion of devils for one. A parasite stuck in our brains for another."
Wyll,"You did the right thing. Another fiend, cast back into the Hells."
Wyll,"If I'd let Karlach live, she'd have brought the Blood War to the Sword Coast and set the whole of it ablaze."
Wyll,"There's no lie a devil won't tell, no soul it won't reap."
Wyll,Healthy. And troubled by that fact.
Wyll,"Consider my blade yours, 'til death makes me lay it down."
Wyll,"But shouldn't the shadow have crept closer, gone darker by now?"
Wyll,"It's natural, to suffer a touch of worry. But an illithid worm should be causing more than mild anxiety."
Wyll,"Heh. I speak out of curiosity, not wishful thinking. At least I'll know to skip supper if you're doing the cooking."
Wyll,Perhaps the worms' vat was poisoned. Perhaps we're uncommonly fit.
Wyll,Or perhaps the tadpoles are merely on holiday.
Wyll,Indeed. Perhaps the worms' vat was poisoned. Perhaps we're uncommonly fit.
Wyll,Let's get some rest. Dawn comes sooner than we think.
Wyll,And that answer is plain as the horns on a wardevil's head: we get these things out.
Wyll,We could conjecture all night. I suppose the 'why' doesn't matter so much as the 'what next'.
Wyll,"Netherese? Ancient magic, that. Netheril is a memory so distant, I wager even the elves have forgotten."
Wyll,"Netherese? Ancient magic, that. Netheril is a memory so distant, I wager even you elves have forgotten."
Wyll,Courage in danger's shadow. I love to see it.
Wyll,I've got a tankard keeping me company.
Wyll,"I'm as real as the heart that beats in your chest. Now go off, have your fun."
Wyll,"Oh, but the Blade is no myth, chief. Myths are tall tales, fleeting as Cormyrian rain."
Wyll,Let's start at allies and work from there.
Wyll,Friends it is.
Wyll,You fight in the Blood War for Zariel. You'll bring the Blood War to the Coast.
Wyll,"To the Hells with you, then - and may you all forever burn."
Wyll,"I see the good in you, Karlach. I promise not to lose sight of it, even when the Hells burn hottest."
Wyll,And yet you served.
Wyll,"By Balduran's helm, I - no. I will not be tricked!"
Wyll,"Proof, clear as summer sky. It's over, Karlach. It's time you feel the sting of the Blade."
Wyll,"Shut it, devil - I know your kind. A heart darker than a shadow's nightmares. You'd cut a child's throat just to taste the blood."
Wyll,"Karlach. The archdevil Zariel's gladiator, come to burn the Sword Coast to ash. "
Wyll,"Are you feeling all right, miss? Maybe a lie-down's in order..."
Wyll,Whispering? Her brain's been bugged too.
Wyll,Do it. Break the pact.
Wyll,"It's me, father. It's all right. You're safe here."
Wyll,"Do it, then. Claim my soul for Zariel. Bring my father back."
Wyll,"Do it, then. Claim my soul for Zariel. Keep my father safe."
Wyll,"Enough, Mizora. My father is dead. Say your piece."
Wyll,Holy hells.
Wyll,"Let them have him, then. He was never any use to me."
Wyll,"Take my father's soul. When the city's free, I will take his place."
Wyll,"Let my father die. When the city's free, I'll take his place."
Wyll,I don't need more friends.
Wyll,Then I live up to my repute. And you - 
Wyll,I know exactly what you are. Zariel's -
Wyll,"The devil's way, isn't it? So casually cruel. I -"
Wyll,"Fair is fair. Tonight, I lost the right to be called 'hero'."
Wyll,Let my deeds to come prove my worth.
Wyll,"I've pledged my life to protecting the meek from monsters - but tonight, I was the rampaging beast."
Wyll,Well met. And - a thousand sorries.
Wyll,"Yes, you have my blade - your leader willing, of course."
Wyll,I hope he can count you in that number.
Wyll,I'm returning to the grove. Zevlor's people need champions.
Wyll,Truce?
Wyll,"Your ally's a fraud - a soldier in the archdevil Zariel's army. Either I cut her down, or she burns the Sword Coast to ash."
Wyll,"You ally with an archdevil's chosen, and -"
Wyll,Break the pact. I will have my freedom.
Wyll,"The devil's head. And yours, if you so much as -"
Wyll,"The parasite links us - it showed me you with the fiend. Her death is my first priority, as it has always been."
Wyll,My blade's found its prey. Zariel's chosen -
Wyll,To the Hells with you devil - and may you forever burn.
Wyll,I had my reasons to hope I was right. But I can't deny the truth.
Wyll,As you say.
Wyll,"Yes, you have my blade - not to mention, a thousand sorries. "
Wyll,You seem like a good crew.
Wyll,"I've not grown any tentacles yet, thank Balduran - but luck won't be on our side forever."
Wyll,I can only hope you won't have to find out.
Wyll,"Infernal soldier, Zariel's lickspittle. I will not let you burn the Sword Coast to ash."
Wyll,Stand back. The first strike is mine.
Wyll,"Pride of the Coast, in the flesh. And you've got -"
Wyll,"I'm the Blade of Frontiers, godsdammit. Take my soul, not his."
Wyll,I won't let you take my father. He's Baldur's Gate's best hope.
Wyll,"By the gods, what have you done to me?"
Wyll,Do whatever you want with me. But leave my friends alone.
Wyll,Shit. Why?
Wyll,You owe them that much.
Wyll,You can't undo what you did. But you can exalt the souls who are still living.
Wyll,And you know they don't give without taking.
Wyll,Raphael. Mizora. You know the ways of devils.
Wyll,Then you're no better than the wretches that condemned them.
Wyll,But you did.
Wyll,Souls like mine.
Wyll,"For every pleasure you took, a damned soul suffered in the Hells. You fed on the hopeless, the frightened. Souls so desperate, they sold themselves to a devil."
Wyll,"No, nothing good."
Wyll,Is that what you think?
Wyll,Mm-hmm.
Wyll,"Is that what matters to you? Sex without union, heat without heart? Did you not take joy in the dance?"
Wyll,You shared your body with the fiend who held my soul. I can forgive it. I can't forget it.
Wyll,You have my might - I owe you that much. But don't owe you more.
Wyll,You shared your body with the fiend who holds my soul. I can forgive it. I can't forget it.
Wyll,"You had your chance, and unleashed a wildfire. Nothing left but dust."
Wyll,"I saw a future for us. A kingdom, even. And you shattered it for a single bite of the Hells."
Wyll,"We danced, we made a connection. And you severed it for a single bite of the Hells."
Wyll,Interesting. I've never grown horns before...
Wyll,"A devil, huh? Not much of a punishment - more like a favour."
Wyll,Do your worst. I'm not afraid of you.
Wyll,You said my targets were monsters. But Karlach's no monster.
Wyll,What happens to my powers if I break the pact?
Wyll,Remain silent.
Wyll,"Then break it now, Mizora. I don't need to wait six months."
Wyll,Then break it already. I suffered enough.
Wyll,What are you proposing?
Wyll,"Shit. What did you do, Mizora?"
Wyll,It can't be. I don't believe you.
Wyll,"Gods, you have the worst timing."
Wyll,Enough games - my father is dead. There must be something you can do.
Wyll,Enough games - they took my father. Now what?
Wyll,Bring back my father. He's Baldur's Gate's best hope.
Wyll,"Please, introduce me to your friends."
Wyll,"What are you up to, Mizora?"
Wyll,You told me devils only. She's - a tiefling. Not a monster.
Wyll,"A pleasure to serve, Mizora."
Wyll,I did what you asked. It's time for my reward.
Wyll,Great. I look forward to my next assignment.
Wyll,Come on. I've earned more than just the one power.
Wyll,I can't accept your reward. I killed an innocent.
Wyll,"I'm supposed to be hunting devils, not refugees."
Wyll,What if I kill Karlach now? Would that make you happy?
Wyll,I'm sorry. I should have obeyed. It won't happen again.
Wyll,Interesting. I don't recall sending out invitations to the Sisters of Justice.
Wyll,"At last, a cure is in reach. To the Towers, then, where the moonlight will lend way to a new dawn."
Wyll,Karlach. The stink of Avernus.
Wyll,"The power is irresistible. You will be a Grand Duke, and the people will cheer your name."
Wyll,That's the way of the Blade.
Wyll,Twelve impossible deeds every day before the sun reaches its apex.
Wyll,"It's a long shot, but - maybe you've grown fond of me."
Wyll,"If so, I'm afraid I must remain a passing fancy. If not, well, it wouldn't be my first misjudgement."
Wyll,Thanks. It's good to know someone's looking out.
Wyll,"You have many talents, but subtlety isn't one of them."
Wyll,I mean - the Blade hasn't exactly lived up to his own reputation.
Wyll,"I mean - the Blade hasn't exactly lived up to his own reputation. Here you are, cheering me up when I almost tore you down."
Wyll,Still - it's a night to remember. You've made sure of that.
Wyll,"Some time alone beneath the stars, and I'll be back to my old self. Promise."
Wyll,Oh! Seems I stumbled ahead of myself. Wouldn't be the first time.
Wyll,"The Blade is my best self. On my best days, I've even lived up to the name."
Wyll,I'm not sure that I am. But it means something that you think so.
Wyll,"A kiss? Well - I can't say I'm not tempted. But not here, not now."
Wyll,There will be another time for us.
Wyll,*Sigh.* You drive a hard bargain. But just the one.
Wyll,The world spits on those partial to devils. I'm hardly a prime catch.
Wyll,I haven't even managed to kill one measly devil. I'm hardly a prime catch.
Wyll,I haven't even managed to kill one measly devil. I'm hardly a prime catch. Certanily not for the great gith warrior from Crèche K'liir.
Wyll,Though I can't say I've earned the honour.
Wyll,Then we share a similar affliction. For I've grown fond of you too.
Wyll,"You're safe another day. Really, that should be enough."
Wyll,These people are still in danger.
Wyll,"Karlach, the creature from Hell, will still threaten them. As will a thousand other perils."
Wyll,These people are still in danger. A thousand perils still threaten them.
Wyll,But consider me flattered. A boon for my ego.
Wyll,"Ah. Well. An intriguing offer, truly, but - I just don't feel that kind of connection."
Wyll,Grab a tankard and suck down some ale. You've an edge in bad need of dulling.
Wyll,Fuss all you want - this celebration is too sweet for you to sour it!
Wyll,To fortune!
Wyll,Your name will be forever linked to the Blade of Frontiers. Could you have imagined such fortune a tenday ago?
Wyll,"Already, the bards are preparing their anthems, the poets their verses."
Wyll,Cheeky! But let's not sour the evening with talk of maybes and might-have-beens.
Wyll,"And to the Blade! Another wrong righted, another page written!"
Wyll,To you - a legend in the making.
Wyll,"Well, it just so happens I'm fond of you too. "
Wyll,To freedom from tyranny! May we hew a clear path for the downtrodden to travel.
Wyll,There she is - the woman herself. Let us raise a glass!
Wyll,There he is - the man himself. Let us raise a glass!
Wyll,"Don't keep me waiting, I beg you."
Wyll,Such exquisite torture.
Wyll,A fine night for it!
Wyll,"We all die. But life's still worth the living. Otherwise, what's the point of it?"
Wyll,If only faith was enough to ward off every bully of the wilds.
Wyll,You're good at it. You've given me some just by being here.
Wyll,Your words cheer me more than any party could.
Wyll,They aren't ready to get on the road on their own.
Wyll,There they are - the hero themselves. Let us raise a glass!
Wyll,"The Blade is dead. You will be Wyll Ravengard, proud and just Duke of Baldur's Gate."
Wyll,Gods know why. You'd be well within your rights to burn me alive.
Wyll,"You were hoping for some peace and quiet out in the forest, and I have ruined your night entirely."
Wyll,"For you, it's as clear as cool water you have that heroism within you."
Wyll,"We've saved the grove, and everyone hails us as heroes."
Wyll,"Ah, I'll be fine. Seeing you has cheered me more than you can know."
Wyll,Ouch! You don't need to mock me when I'm feeling low.
Wyll,If only half the world had half the heart you do.
Wyll,You pull them off far more finely than I do.
Wyll,"Horns this sharp will pop the balloons, you see. And the guests won't take kindly to scars quite so monstrous."
Wyll,As I seem to unsettle everyone nowadays.
Wyll,"I'm a devil. I love the people from the grove, but I unsettle them deep down."
Wyll,"In truth, I don't feel in a festive mood, and didn't want to cast a grey cloud over the night."
Wyll,Saving the people of the grove was all the satisfaction I could ask.
Wyll,I know how to have fun! I have lots of fun every day!
Wyll,I can say it even more nicely.
Wyll,Really? I'm honoured.
Wyll,"Oh, I'm deeply proud of you. A touch less so of myself."
Wyll,"Agh, Hells! I was hoping you wouldn't notice I was gone."
Wyll,"Have a laugh, make some noise. I'll by my charming self before you know it. "
Wyll,I just better not wake with any holes in my neck.
Wyll,You can't be Grand Duke. Mizora would wield too much over Baldur's Gate.
Wyll,"You are no aristocrat. You are forever the Blade of Frontiers, hunter of foul beasts."
Wyll,"You are no aristocrat. You will be the Blade of Avernus, hunter of fiends and foul beasts."
Wyll,"But Karlach is dead, and Gods know how many other of my victims were people like her."
Wyll,I shouldn't be celebrated tonight. That's why I left.
Wyll,But off with you. This is your day! Have a dance. Enjoy the music. 
Wyll,"Ha! In truth, I always enjoyed a bit of pomp."
Wyll,"It's delicious, don't get me wrong, but that man wouldn't eat a vegetable unless Mystra herself commanded it."
Wyll,You're running away from Gale's cooking.
Wyll,"She's started a huge fire, and you're trying to save my life."
Wyll,"Karlach got lusty at the party, didn't she?"
Wyll,"You must be Volo in disguise, out here to harangue me for some tales of the Frontiers."
Wyll,Let me think... Why are you really here?
Wyll,Oh! I will safeguard my undergarments with care.
Wyll,Too much honey-wine can do that. You should watch yourself.
Wyll,Not that I'd necessarily object.
Wyll,Clearly Mol has put you up to stealing my britches so you can turn them into a flag for her gang.
Wyll,"It's a long shot, but - maybe you've grown fond of me. Gods know I've grown fond of you."
Wyll,I love the way your nose wrinkles up when you get the scent of a lead for the first time.
Wyll,"You have a vow from the Blade. He will show you a wonderful time, another night."
Wyll,"Aw, by Balduran's elbow, I can't stay feeling gloomy with you looking at me like that."
Wyll,But not tonight. Tonight is about you.
Wyll,Maybe.
Wyll,Too many reasons to count. I might share them someday.
Wyll,But who am I fooling? I can't go back to that life. 
Wyll,You cut quite a fine figure. I can just imagine leading you with an entire ballroom watching.
Wyll,"I had years of lessons but in truth, it's all about your partner."
Wyll,"I imagine you're fairly skilled with your form, too. That would be a sight to behold."
Wyll,Much to the exhaustion of the good ladies and gentlemen of the Gate.
Wyll,I'm afraid my feet are firmly planted to the ground this evening.
Wyll,"No better time to brush up on my skills, then. It would do me no good to fail my new partner."
Wyll,"And I am Wyll Ravengard, Grand Duke of the Wyrm, Heart of the Gate."
Wyll,"Florrick is Grand Duke of the Crossing, The Face of Devotion."
Wyll,Kagha's a piece of work. Let's see if your wit surpasses your might.
Wyll,"They're tough kids. Smart, too. The future's in good hands."
Wyll,"Don't push it, kid. If you see trouble, then run. Only fight if you have to."
Wyll,Wow - you really showed that small defenceless child who's in charge.
Wyll,This Kagha's barbaric. Know this: I've got your back.
Wyll,"A fickle one, aren't you? I hope you know what you're doing."
Wyll,"Think it through. Anger Kagha, and the whole grove could suffer."
Wyll,"Monster? Too kind. A demon, more like."
Wyll,...and suffer its sting.
Wyll,Damnable roach. Provoke the blade...
Wyll,Bastards. The Blade comes for you.
Wyll,"Don't falter now. Blades high, arrows nocked!"
Wyll,"By sickle and sword, strike them down!"
Wyll,Harsh. Remind me to stay on your good side.
Wyll,"Tell her. But if she pulls out a pot of oil, run!"
Wyll,Horrifying. We should check on the girl.
Wyll,"How generous. Do you charge by the bell, or the spell?"
Wyll,Gods! What in the deepest Hell is wrong with you?
Wyll,"I've carved up goblins from here to inner Chult. We will overcome, whatever the odds."
Wyll,"'Digging their graves'? Why not pass out daggers to stick themselves with, while you're at it?"
Wyll,Not now. Trouble's afoot.
Wyll,These poor souls seek a champion - and you turn your back?
Wyll,I'd sooner swig a flask of acid than anything a goblin cooks up.
Wyll,Zevlor.
Wyll,"By the Triad, there is only one correct answer. Refuse him, and we sentence these people to die."
Wyll,"Focus, children. "
Wyll,Children. 
Wyll,Go right ahead.
Wyll,What'd I tell you?
Wyll,You can do it. Just have to believe!
Wyll,Use that too. Your entire body is a weapon. 
Wyll,Those goblins don't stand a chance.
Wyll,You got it!
Wyll,Don't get ahead of yourself. You can't even hold a real sword yet.
Wyll,"Pretty good, pretty good."
Wyll,"Swing, count a beat, and swing again."
Wyll,Good try. But don't just swing all pell-mell.
Wyll,Now try ducking after the first swing.
Wyll,"Almost there. Keep your hips square, and I think you'll have it."
Wyll,"A bard started calling me that after I'd saved him from gnolls, and the name stuck!"
Wyll,"Almost there. Keep your hips square, and I think you'll have it!"
Wyll,"Head up high, kid. To fight your enemy, you need to see 'em."
Wyll,"As true as mithral, kid."
Wyll,As many as there are stars in the sky.
Wyll,Now hold the left arm across your face - and jab with the right.
Wyll,Grind your feet into the ground. Really lock 'em in.
Wyll,I paid the price of angering the wrong devil.
Wyll,I've never been more thrilled to be wrong.
Wyll,Ah - a familiar face. Didn't think I'd see you again!
Wyll,Blow the horn - the trap has been set. 
Wyll,You are a reckoning force. Take a breather - and then we'll talk.
Wyll,"You dare show your face here, Karlach? Inside, if you're so keen to talk."
Wyll,"Kind words in unkind times, my friend."
Wyll,"You're on the right path, Umi. Go on, now - practise what you've learned."
Wyll,"Ignore them, Umi. Go on, now - practise what you've learned."
Wyll,"Ignore him, Umi. Go on, now - practise what you've learned."
Wyll,"Ignore her, Umi. Go on, now - practise what you've learned."
Wyll,Her name is Karlach. An archdevil's soldier I swore on my good eye to kill.
Wyll,"I like your thinking. Besides, I watched you fight at the gate. I could use an ally like you."
Wyll,"'Hero', 'Blade' - names strangers gave me. My friends call me 'Wyll'."
Wyll,I accept your invitation.
Wyll,But I won't deny this infection is bothersome. 
Wyll,"Just so you know, my first duty is Karlach. I'm oathbound to go after her."
Wyll,"But we haven't sprouted any tentacles - not yet, anyway. Could just be good luck. I'm not so..."
Wyll,I'm sure you know the stories. Doomed to shed our skin and become illithid. They say there's no coming back.
Wyll,"You should have stayed in the Hells, devil."
Wyll,"Yes - but not here. For the sake of these children, I'll stay my blade."
Wyll,"For the sake of these children, I'll stay my blade. Go, enjoy your breaths while you can still take them."
Wyll,And I know the Coast is in danger as long as you walk it.
Wyll,You just have to buy enough time to run. Come on. I believe in you. You can do this. 
Wyll,You just have to buy enough time to -
Wyll,"You've got nerve to come here, Karlach."
Wyll,"Come, meet me inside."
Wyll,I'll be in the hollow. Don't you dare make trouble.
Wyll,"We'll talk soon, you have my word."
Wyll,"Blow the horn - the trap has been set. Today, we write our own legends!"
Wyll,Come. It's time to paint the place red.
Wyll,"It's all right. Don't tell anyone - but I was afraid, too."
Wyll,"I hate to admit it, but... it's a good plan. Looks like the team's back together."
Wyll,"Did you, now?"
Wyll,"In the name of the Blade, attack!"
Wyll,"You had your chance, and you wasted it."
Wyll,"Inside, and hurry. I want that gate closed when the goblins get here."
Wyll,Fine - one last chance. See that you don't waste it.
Wyll,Give me one reason why they shouldn't slay you where you stand.
Wyll,"Now, now. Real heroes don't argue - they cooperate!<br>"
Wyll,You dare show your face?
Wyll,"What are you... no, no! You have to fight it!"
Wyll,I see now it was naught but a fantasy. I will fight at your side. But I can give no more than that.
Wyll,"I thought our connection meant something to you. Certainly, it did to me."
Wyll,"Either you're changing, or I am. I'm not a betting man, but my coin's on the latter."
Wyll,"You're different than I thought. At first I thought it was the parasite. Now... now, I don't know what to think."
Wyll,But you seem intent on proving me wrong.
Wyll,"We've made a connection. Please, don't sacrifice that for the sake of cold-blooded thrills."
Wyll,"The first time I saw you, I figured you a champion. A person of valour, integrity."
Wyll,"The first time I saw you, I figured you a champion. A man of valour, integrity."
Wyll,"The first time I saw you, I figured you a champion. A woman of valour, integrity."
Wyll,"I'd like to stay, if it's all the same."
Wyll,"You're already halfway there, kid."
Wyll,Really.
Wyll,"Good work, kids. You're all heroes, each and every one of you."
Wyll,The shadow curse. We'll need that Moonlantern from Nere to survive the journey to Moonrise Towers.
Wyll,So we're going up there without the lantern? I hope you know what you're doing.
Wyll,There we have it. Let 'Operation Free Nere' commence.
Wyll,"I'm not so keen on taking a shadow-nap, myself. We need to free Nere and get that Moonlantern."
Wyll,I reckon diplomacy may be in order. The Blade could use a breather.
Wyll,I reckon this place is swarming with slavers. I hope you know what you're doing.
Wyll,"Did I hear right - they keep gnomes as slaves? Not for much longer, if the Blade has a say."
Wyll,"We're closing in on Nere. But if we want his head, we'll need to free him first."
Wyll,"Not to mention - they keep gnomes as slaves. Though not for much longer, if I have a say."
Wyll,"Disposed of like rubbish, like scraps. Are there no limits to people's cruelty?"
Wyll,Go on - get it done. You've got me at your side.
Wyll,"Such handsome armour - a fighting force of some renown, perhaps."
Wyll,"If we must. Oh, but imagine what tales these bones might tell if they could."
Wyll,"Let us do what we can to avoid their fate, then."
Wyll,"If their killer's still around, it's not Shar's name I'm most interested in saving."
Wyll,"Let's come back to this later, yeah? We've got more pressing matters afoot."
Wyll,"Let's get moving, then. Once we fill our packs with what we can carry, of course."
Wyll,Let's hope whoever killed them has long since marched on.
Wyll,"Now, now. Take a breath, count to ten. This battle's been long-finished - no reason to fight it again."
Wyll,Never seen a lantern like this - just a sprinkling of dust at the bottom.
Wyll,The Moonlantern. It must be.
Wyll,"The name sounds familiar. A Harper leader, if I recall."
Wyll,Speak up. You can't just let the clan keep them.
Wyll,Your heart made of stone? They deserved freedom - and you denied it.
Wyll,"Speak up, chief. You can't just let the clan keep them."
Wyll,"No. No, please!"
Wyll,She's leaving? Laridda will be heartbroken.
Wyll,Duergar killed their children. They should pay the price for the cruelty. 
Wyll,"Always another evil to correct, always another monster to slay."
Wyll,Ugh - more blood than an abattoir.
Wyll,I never thought we'd bargain with an illithid. Let's hope this ring proves invaluable.
Wyll,Tell me you hear that voice.
Wyll,It said 'they're coming.' But... who?
Wyll,"These myconids are the hospitable sort. Refreshing, after our run-in with Kagha."
Wyll,"I'm starting to feel less a protector of the people, and more of an errand boy."
Wyll,It's broken. And I'm not sure I want to brave the cursed land without it.
Wyll,"So it's like that, is it? So be it - the Blade does not yield!<br>"
Wyll,"Oh hells, why not? All hail MAHKLOOMPAH!"
Wyll,Adamantine. That forge must be within spitting distance.
Wyll,Hold your tongue. Those rothé are ready to blow - and you'll be lighting the fuse.
Wyll,"Next time your mind sinks that low, keep things to yourself."
Wyll,Some thoughts aren't meant to be said aloud. That was one of them.
Wyll,Damned slavers. Just the sight of them turns my stomach.
Wyll,"Hells. How sick must a soul be to take slaves, let alone lash them?"
Wyll,"Let's all keep our heads, eh? You, us... Nere."
Wyll,Moonrise? We're closing in on the Towers. And the curse...
Wyll,Have you no heart? They deserved freedom - and you denied it.
Wyll,"Don't be rash, now. I may be tolerant, but I won't let myself be fed to the fishes."
Wyll,Umi. I don't need you to be like me.
Wyll,Spill it. Mayrina deserves the truth.
Wyll,"By the hells' fires, has your heart shrunk so small?"
Wyll,Blech. I'd rather drink the Baldur's Gate sewers dry.
Wyll,"Nice, a free ring. Maybe wash it a few thousand times before trying it on."
Wyll,"Smart move. Let's go, before he offers a whiff of his behind."
Wyll,"'Down in the pits'? Either Halsin's in a foul mood, or he awaits rescue. Likely both."
Wyll,"Boss Ragzlin, eh? Must be the goblin in charge."
Wyll,Gods - I wager the dead elf is Halsin. He won't be helping us now.
Wyll,"Gods. I think that's Halsin, the druid."
Wyll,What a shame. He could have been our key to a cure.
Wyll,Really? I mean - really?
Wyll,"You didn't think this through, did you?"
Wyll,"That fellow was infected, like us. Is this the mark of a True Soul?"
Wyll,Hollering hells - you're a cambion.
Wyll,Be careful! Let's get this poor man down alive.
Wyll,"We surely shouldn't just leave such a threat out, where anyone could stumble across it."
Wyll,"Let's leave them alone, I don't want to be invited to the wedding."
Wyll,Go on. Make me proud!
Wyll,Take your time... get a feel for it.
Wyll,"I'm proud of you, kids."
Wyll,Elbows high. Now pull back and... swing!
Wyll,Give it a good whack!
Wyll,That's the way!
Wyll,He wants mercy. I say show it to him - decisively.
Wyll,"All that, and you'd give him a hand? You're a fickle one, chief."
Wyll,Gods. I'm not sure who to pity more for that display - you or the goblin.
Wyll,"Good. No telling how many lives he might yet have taken. Tonight, the Coast breathes easier."
Wyll,One horn? Then you mean Karlach. Archdevil's bootlicker.
Wyll,Zorru abandoned Yul to the githyanki. Damned coward.
Wyll,Damn you. My father's in danger. We cannot turn our backs.
Wyll,So father said. I won't soon forget.
Wyll,"Trust us to see it through, Counsellor."
Wyll,But pride is no reason to refuse help to my own flesh and blood. How can we help?
Wyll,The circumstance of my birth is no matter of pride for neither me nor my father.
Wyll,"No, it can't be. You mean, they've taken -"
Wyll,A story best left for calmer days. Now breathe deeply - are you in pain?
Wyll,Counsellor Florrick - are you all right?
Wyll,The girl's in a fix. It's a hero's duty to step in.
Wyll,"End her now, or she'll be cursing new victims by sundown."
Wyll,What in the hells...?
Wyll,"I reckon Dror Ragzlin's the gobbo in charge, the way this one's carrying on."
Wyll,Isn't that something? The artefact scattered the voice to the four winds.
Wyll,Gods damn it. My head...
Wyll,Gone - just like that. That relic works in mysterious ways.
Wyll,Seems we've pegged all three marks. Let the boss hunt begin.
Wyll,Weapon at the ready - now's the time.
Wyll,"A priestess. One of the leaders, no doubt about it. Let's make her squeal."
Wyll,By Balduran's bones...
Wyll,Do you... do you feel it too?
Wyll,Monstrous.
Wyll,Not bad. Again.
Wyll,Go on. Give me your best shot.
Wyll,Liar.
Wyll,"To think this crèche was nestled in the valley, a day's trot away."
Wyll,"All my time roaming the frontiers, and I'd seen neither hair nor hide of a githyanki."
Wyll,I'd like to say I respect Lae'zel's choice. But her faith has turned to fanaticism.
Wyll,I'd like to say I respect your choice. But your faith has turned to fanaticism.
Wyll,Loyalty is one thing. Wilful ignorance is another.
Wyll,"Raphael's house may be posh, but it's seen better days."
Wyll,All the tumbledown opulence of a withering Upper City manor.
Wyll,"Love Shadowheart's new look. Softer, less severe. It suits her."
Wyll,"Love the new look. Softer, less severe. It suits you."
Wyll,"What's this I smell? Rotted eggs, clotted blood, and the overwhelming tang of sour cabbage."
Wyll,"Balduran's bones - the githyanki crèche is naught but rubble, may the Triad have mercy."
Wyll,"I... hmm... oh! I seem to have forgotten myself, there."
Wyll,Karlach's all fire and fury. I pray to the Triad it doesn't consume her.
Wyll,Karlach - you were all fire and fury. I pray to the Triad it doesn't consume you.
Wyll,"If Gale's intentions are virtuous, ultimate power will sour them. And if they are not, well - I shudder to think of the chaos he could sow."
Wyll,I have seen the ravages visited on Toril by the gods. Even the ones we so naively call 'good'.
Wyll,"Too dangerous, even, for Mystra. But I would sooner trust it with a god than a man - including you."
Wyll,The menacing githyanki machine and its jagged pincers held no cure at all. Who could've thought?
Wyll,"Either way, I mourn for the image of you I once held dear."
Wyll,I'd ask what's become of you. But perhaps this is who you've been all along.
Wyll,"Isobel, Selûne's light made real. And you slaughtered her like cattle and left Last Light for the shadows to feed on."
Wyll,"The Harpers have been compromised - a balancing power, now unbalanced."
Wyll,Jaheira's support has been invaluable. We should return it in kind.
Wyll,"You did what was right, knowing you stood to suffer for it. In so doing, you proved what it means to be a hero."
Wyll,"Shadowheart did what was right, knowing she stood to suffer for it. In so doing, she proved what it means to be a hero."
Wyll,The truth is finally dawning. Shadowheart can follow its light - or she can retreat back into dusk.
Wyll,"Your truth is finally dawning, Shadowheart. You can follow its light - or you can retreat back into dusk."
Wyll,Taken from the light to be raised in darkness.
Wyll,"Orin's game is abduction, is it? Well - we can't stand idly by. We've got an ally to rescue."
Wyll,But I'm not proud of it. Not after... all this.
Wyll,Killing Astarion was the right thing to do. I have to believe that.
Wyll,"Hunt the monsters of the Sword Coast, protect the people - that was my promise."
Wyll,"If she wants to go make these last moments count, then don't hold her back."
Wyll,"But if this is your choice, I won't stop you. I never would."
Wyll,She'd become a mind flayer - but she'd lead us to a sure victory. It's what she does.
Wyll,It's bound to happen. I just don't know when or how.
Wyll,You'd become a mind flayer - but you'd lead us to a sure victory. It's what you do.
Wyll,I can't bear to think of it. But I can't tell you 'no'.
Wyll,"Insert the artefact into the planecaster. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to see who - or what - is inside it."
Wyll,"My head throbs with every step. The closer the brain, the louder its call."
Wyll,"Minsc is being tricked. By the Hells, we've got to rip him away from that shapeshifter."
Wyll,Come. We have a Netherbrain to tear up.
Wyll,"Vampire spawn. One's proven enough, let alone a horde of them. "
Wyll,"He may be dead, but his tyranny still suffocates Balduran's grand city."
Wyll,There is no hell hot enough for a man like Gortash. 
Wyll,"Whoever the culprit, let it be known: I will not stand for more innocent blood being shed in our camp."
Wyll,"Alfira wouldn't have harmed a housefly. A gentle young soul, slain in her prime."
Wyll,I can't bear to think of it. But I can't tell her 'no'.
Wyll,You're glowing with magic. Mystra must be mighty happy right about now.
Wyll,The good news: we've got the Orphic Hammmer. The bad news: we have to get into the Astral Prism to use it.
Wyll,Well look at you - you're positively glowing. Must've woke up on the good side of the bunk.
Wyll,"Tempting as these powers sound, we should recognise this dream for what it is - the tadpoles' little trick."
Wyll,"I had a dream last night - a vivid one. And so did you, judging from the way my tadpole is tingling."
Wyll,"Shadowheart's gone, then - and I can't blame her. Let us try to take better care of each other."
Wyll,"Karlach will, too. Just give her time."
Wyll,"You will too, Karlach. I know it."
Wyll,"You will too, Karlach. I know it. Until then, I'm here every step of the way."
Wyll,The agony of knowing the end is near.
Wyll,"But this is your decision to make. Wherever you lead, I will follow."
Wyll,"Were I to choose, I'd break the prince free. Better to entrust our fates to him before making an unneeded sacrifice - or entrusting Orpheus' power to the illithid."
Wyll,And then there's the Orphic Hammer. We could refuse the Emperor entirely and break Orpheus free.
Wyll,"Assimilate Orpheus for yourself, and you become illithid. The Emperor does it, and it claims the prince's power for himself."
Wyll,"Shit. Every choice an impossible one, every consequence unknown."
Wyll,"Dammit all, we've got to get Gale back. If that means killing Gortash, nothing would give me greater pleasure."
Wyll,Ah - what a relief to have you back with us. Who doesn't enjoy a bit of pomp with their circumstance?
Wyll,I know it was. I gave my soul to so that the people of Baldur's Gate might live.
Wyll,"Oh ye gods. Never change, Minsc. Never change."
Wyll,'Smiting evil' is my middle name.
Wyll,Please understand - I thought she was a true devil. An agent of the archdevil Zariel.
Wyll,I'm no hero. But I've dedicated my life to keeping the Sword Coast safe from the monsters that roam it.
Wyll,"- goodness, my palms are all sweaty. It's just that - you were always my hero."
Wyll,"My father told me all about how... how you struck down the mad cleric Bassilus, how -"
Wyll,No good ever came from trusting honey-tongued strangers conjured up by illithid worms. 
Wyll,I wouldn't advise it. Play with fire and you get burned. That's always the way of it.
Wyll,Well said. This dream figure is no friend to us.
Wyll,Good idea.
Wyll,"This place is astonishing, a bard's legend made real."
Wyll,"The deathbringer Sarevok. He was made into ash - and from ash, it seems, he rose again."
Wyll,Now how about we go and reverse Cazador's fortunes?
Wyll,Seems you're the missing pawn in your master's deadly game.
Wyll,But I'm not convinced the githyanki prince wouldn't smash us to pieces given the chance.
Wyll,I'd love nothing more than to smash Orpheus free with that hammer and cut out the illithid middleman.
Wyll,Ah - Halsin is such a delight. Woe to the cultist who tangles with that thick hunk of an elf.
Wyll,"Let's dash for the exit, lest we suffer the full extent of Vlaakith's fury."
Wyll,"Mysterious, that Shadowheart - and mysteriously endearing. Behind those eyes lurk uncountable secrets."
Wyll,We made our choice; there's no going back. Onward - the Netherbrain awaits.
Wyll,Have you seen Astarion? He's positively glowing. Must've woke up on the good side of the bunk.
Wyll,"My first tour of a githyanki crèche. Memorable, to be certain, but the service left something to be desired."
Wyll,"Too dangerous, even, for Mystra. But I would sooner trust it with a god than with Gale."
Wyll,"Too close for comfort - but thanks to some quick thinking, the githyanki crèche is still standing."
Wyll,Shit. It isn't over - Ketheric Thorm still lives.
Wyll,You slurped that thing up like a horse with a carrot. I hope you got what you needed from it.
Wyll,Though I suppose that's not what you wanted to talk about.
Wyll,Gone gods - watching you consume that tadpole was more disgusting than the tadpole itself.
Wyll,Gale slurped that thing up like a horse with a carrot. I hope he got what he needed from it.
Wyll,What is she capable of? And where will she strike next?
Wyll,"I have battled great evils, been mocked by villains of all sorts. But Orin - she is beyond even Thorm. Her mind is twisted beyond recognition."
Wyll,Congratulations - the amulet is yours. But don't think Valeria was the only soul you sacrificed to retrieve it.
Wyll,"This crown seems too powerful and dangerous an object for mere mortals to possess, Gale."
Wyll,"Hells. Whatever you do, don't set her off."
Wyll,Gale's glowing with magic. Mystra must be mighty happy right about now.
Wyll,"If your intentions are virtuous, ultimate power will sour them. And if they are not, well - I shudder to think of the chaos you could sow."
Wyll,I'm no stranger to the infernal. Better to slay a devil before her fires burn common folk to ash.
Wyll,Well met - and call on me if you find a fix for this affliction of ours. Might even join you once that devil's met my blade.
Wyll,"I like your thinking. Besides, I watched you at the gate. I could use an ally like you."
Wyll,A splendid plan. We'll talk more there.
Wyll,"Still - when the time comes, call for the Blade. I won't be long to answer."
Wyll,An excellent suggestion - but your party's full up.
Wyll,I'd welcome the company - but your leader should make the decision.
Wyll,"'Hero,' 'Blade' - names strangers gave me. My friends call me 'Wyll'."
Wyll,I'll presume that's githyanki for 'yes'. Now let's move.
Wyll,"I'd be a fool to let you turn your back. Pledge me your talents, and I'll pledge you mine."
Wyll,"Trust me, gith - I know the stories. Doomed to shed our skin and become illithid. And they say there's no coming back."
Wyll,"Could just be good luck. But sooner or later, it's bound to run out."
Wyll,"But I haven't sprouted any tentacles - least not yet, thank Balduran."
Wyll,"I'd be a fool if it didn't. I know the stories - doomed to shed my skin, become illithid. And there's no coming back."
Wyll,Now let's move.
Wyll,"Besides, I watched you at the gate. I could use an ally like you."
Wyll,"You'll need to make room if you want to partner up, though."
Wyll,"I'll need to talk to your leader if you want to partner up, though."
Wyll,But good luck can't last forever. Invitation accepted.
Wyll,"I haven't sprouted any tentacles yet, thank Balduran."
Wyll,We can't leave her be. Who knows how many lives she might take?
Wyll,A fiend makes for poor company - unless it's been stuffed and mounted on your wall.
Wyll,That ship's sailed the Styx already. All I can hope for's to limit the damage.
Wyll,Karlach's her name. An archdevil's soldier I swore on my good eye to kill.
Wyll,"Better friends than the ones hitching a ride in our skulls, at least."
Wyll,"You should have stayed in the hells, devil."
Wyll,Trust me - I won't be far behind.
Wyll,"Go, enjoy every breath while you can still take them."
Wyll,"Yes - but not here. For the sake of these people, I'll stay my blade."
Wyll,You think I don't know the truth? How your flesh blazes with Avernus' heat? How your axe splits your victims straight down the middle?
Wyll,"For the sake of these people, I'll stay my blade. Go, enjoy your breaths while you can still take them."
Wyll,"Gain their trust now, and prime their souls for the reaping. I know the tricks."
Wyll,And I know this grove is in danger as long as you walk the Coast.
Wyll,"Don't act like we're friends, devil. I know what you are. I know who you serve."
Wyll,I know what you are. I know who you serve.
Wyll,"I've seen her myself, tearing through the Hells on behalf of her mistress, Zariel."
Wyll,I am the Blade. I will chase my prey until death takes me.
Wyll,"Oh, and a piece of advice: don't play with devils unless you don't mind getting burnt."
Wyll,Hold your tongue. It's not you I want - it's Karlach. Send her over.
Wyll,Well met. The Blade of Frontiers at your -
Wyll,Have you thought about my offer? We would make potent allies.
Wyll,"The Blade of Frontiers, ever at your service - and ever in awe of your skill."
Wyll,"You cut 'em down clean - and as well you should. Kagha was a monster, poisoned almost the whole lot."
Wyll,"The druids, dead - a damn shame to see."
Wyll,"I will find you, Karlach. And you will meet my blade."
Wyll,You are the company you keep. And you have chosen poor company.
Wyll,I'm sure you know the stories. Doomed to shed our skin and become illithid. And they say there's no coming back.
Wyll,It's Karlach I want. I'll be waiting.
Wyll,"I have seen the ravages visited on Toril by the gods, Gale. Even the ones we so naively call 'good'."
Wyll,You met her? So she filled you with lies.
Wyll,I tracked her through the Hells to the mind flayer ship. But the damned illithids infected me before I could end her.
Wyll,Our winding paths lead to one certain end: victory.
Wyll,"*Sigh.* I knew we hadn't seen the last of this place. Come, let's hear what the Emperor has to say. I can't say we've much of a choice."
Wyll,"I trust you and stand by you. However you choose, I am at the ready."
Wyll,"Gather your wits, tend to your weapons. It's time to leave this damnable Prism behind, once and for all."
Wyll,There's a schism growing among the githyanki people. And Lae'zel just took one step towards choosing a side.
Wyll,There's a schism growing among your people. And Lae'zel just took one step towards choosing a side.
Wyll,"There's a schism growing among your people, Lae'zel. And you just took one step towards choosing a side."
Wyll,"Lae'zel's suspicion and Shadowheart's guile made for a lethal combination. I fear for our fellowship, if trust is in such short supply."
Wyll,"Lae'zel's suspicion and your guile made for a lethal combination. I fear for our fellowship, if trust is in such short supply."
Wyll,"Hm - the place is remarkably well-kept, as underground lairs go."
Wyll,Mystra wants to meet Gale? Impressive. The only thing a god's ever offered me is a cold shoulder.
Wyll,Terrible to think of the atrocities these walls have been witness to.
Wyll,The seat of the Iron Throne was razed a century ago - or so it was said.
Wyll,"Maybe Gale should avoid items laced with dark magic. 'You are what you eat', as the old adage goes."
Wyll,"Maybe you should avoid items laced with dark magic. 'You are what you eat', as the old adage goes."
Wyll,"That's where I stand. But whatever you do, I trust you to the last."
Wyll,"If someone must assimilate Orpheus, I'd sooner trust you with the power than the illithid..."
Wyll,"I fear we have no choice. What I ask is unreasonable by every standard. It sickens me to think, let alone say, but -"
Wyll,But I think you've got the right idea. Better I live fully and meaningfully than to pine for an always-and-forever I could never achieve.
Wyll,Well - I'll cross this place off our list off possible holiday destinations.
Wyll,Wish I could say the same.
Wyll,"I trust you and stand by you. However you choose, the Blade is at the ready."
Wyll,"The Netherbrain shakes us, quakes us, claws at our minds. And all for naught."
Wyll,It's afraid. It knows we will fight it - and it knows we can win.
Wyll,"I will give you as many kisses as you need, darling."
Wyll,Karlach is an archdevil's soldier I swore on my good eye to kill.
Wyll,You met her? Then you were subject to her lies.
Wyll,I'm not surprised. My target is well-known for her brutality in service of her evil mistress.
Wyll,"But I haven't sprouted any tentacles - not yet, anyway. Nor have you. Could just be good luck. I'm not so..."
Wyll,"Mm - doomed to shed our skin and become illithid, or so the stories go."
Wyll,Hells' great fires - you were on the ship.
Wyll,"Introductions are in order. The Blade of Frontiers, at your..."
Wyll,You were a marvel to behold! Even Balduran himself would bow to such formidable talent.
Wyll,"Godspeed, and may your journey be true."
Wyll,I can't stop you from taking it. But I won't be joining you.
Wyll,"She's out there now, preying on the innocent. I don't kill her, she'll leave behind nothing but a trail of corpses."
Wyll,I can't stop you from taking it. But I can't join you - no matter how much you might mean to me.
Wyll,"If the fires must spread and the walls must tumble, at least we have each other to cling to."
Wyll,"Death and devastation, blood and battle. So our path is set - and we've no choice but to follow."
Wyll,They're the ones that will guide you to victory.
Wyll,"You are not just your fear and your doubts. You are your bravery and your valour, your skill and your strength. Let those voices drown out the others."
Wyll,There's only one good response to it: 'Shut the hell up.'
Wyll,"Ah - the little voice in the back of our minds. 'All is lost!' it cries out, and it's all too easy to believe it."
Wyll,"Suffering and hate can never prevail, for as long as we wield them."
Wyll,"They are the shields that protect us from the Netherbrain's attacks, and the blades with which we will strike it."
Wyll,"You are not illithid, no matter what your reflection might tell you. You serve no hivemind, you tend to your own thoughts, you act of your own will."
Wyll,"But we don't need luck, for we have something far greater: courage, nerve - and a reason to win."
Wyll,"I've seen a lot in my day - some good, some bad. And I know when I'm being led down a dark path."
Wyll,"Cordula Eltan is the Duke of the Seatower, a Legacy Reborn."
Wyll,"From what I've seen, your talents extend well beyond magic. Trust me - you'll be fine."
Wyll,"Then I'll have your back. When my allies are in danger, I'm not in the habit of turning away."
Wyll,"First, they took Minsc. Now, they take Jaheira's face. Does their malice have no limit?"
Wyll,Minsc? Then the great hero is here!
Wyll,"Gods, the horror of being forever locked away. The grave would have been a more merciful fate."
Wyll,A merciful end. To lock them away forever would have been an unbearable agony.
Wyll,"The spawn have their freedom - but what of the city, what of the lives they take? Gods, I can't imagine..."
Wyll,"Only kisses. But sweet as honey mead, every last one."
Wyll,Ah - the Blushing Mermaid. I stole a few kisses or three here before my exile.
Wyll,I am here for Duke Ulder Ravengard. Show me the way!
Wyll,Shit. Florrick's a true friend and ally - we can't let them hang her.
Wyll,No! We have to stop this!
Wyll,No! What are you doing?
Wyll,Helm almighty!
Wyll,That's all three Netherstones. We have what we need to eliminate the brain and end the Absolute.
Wyll,This isn't a decision to take lightly. We should talk first.
Wyll,"Now, let's kill ourselves a Netherbrain."
Wyll,"Whatever crisis we face, whatever danger threatens - your Grand Duke will always fight beside you. My blade is yours."
Wyll,"I cannot promise that this is the last time I will ask you to fight for your future, your lives, and your city. But I can promise you this."
Wyll,We fight for the survival of Baldur's Gate. And we will win.
Wyll,"I was selfish to ask you to live a half-life as a plaything for the Blade of Frontiers. And even more selfish, to be disappointed by your answer."
Wyll,"I was selfish to ask you to live a half-life as a plaything for the Blade of Avernus. And even more selfish, to be disappointed by your answer."
Wyll,"But it warms me to I can always find you, dance with you, in the years to come."
Wyll,Looks like we owe Raphael a housecall.<br>
Wyll,"I'll bring you anything you need - robes, books... sustenance. You'll be safe."
Wyll,Hells - the brain can seize infected minds. What other powers will it manifest?
Wyll,"Don't you dare think of giving in. If you're so keen to hunt, we'll find deserving prey."
Wyll,"Her face still haunts me. If I could make the sun rise in the west, reverse the Chionthar's waters, I'd spare her my folly."
Wyll,"May he be at peace. We did not see eye to eye, but his every thought, every act, was in service to his people. Among men, there was none greater."
Wyll,"Indeed. We've not always seen eye to eye, but his every thought, every act, was in service to his people. Among men, there is none greater."
Wyll,Hardly. Astonishing that you'd even utter her name.
Wyll,Hells. Have I fallen so far from your favour?
Wyll,"Indeed. You were a source of light among shadows. Still are, for that matter."
Wyll,Why not? Could be good for a laugh.
Wyll,I'm more than game. Let's do it.
Wyll,"Go on, have your fun - you won't regret it!"
Wyll,I'm no so sure...
Wyll,"Between you and me, I love a good clown - and Dribbles is the best."
Wyll,"I'm afraid have little experience with lanceboard, let alone the command of soldiers."
Wyll,Balduran? No. I don't believe it.
Wyll,The helm of Balduran.
Wyll,Justice does not entail granting mercy to monsters. We should not have let this abomination go free.
Wyll,"Volothamp Geddarm? By the gods, do something!"
Wyll,"By the gods, do something. Or are you going to let them blow up the poor guy?"
Wyll,"The wizard's a veritable geyser of rage. Provoke him, and he'll erupt."
Wyll,Please - you can't liberate Aylin from one master only to chain her to another.
Wyll,Magical relics galore. Seems like Gale's type of place.
Wyll,"'Reeducation?' Forced indoctrination, more like - her memories cleansed, her mind a clean parchment for Viconia to write on."
Wyll,"Her mind, gone in an instant - the elder brain holds phenomenal power. There's no telling what it's capable of."
Wyll,"We'll make a place for you - somewhere secluded, somewhere you can call home."
Wyll,"The people I'm sworn to protect will see only an illithid. They would cower in fear - or worse yet, try to fill you with arrows and daggers."
Wyll,"I'd venture into the wilds with you at my side, if I could. 'The illithid who saved Baldur's Gate', I would cry, and the people would greet you as the hero I know you to be."
Wyll,You've made me a new man.
Wyll,I am the Blade of Frontiers. I swore to protect the Coast from the monsters that prey on it. And I know my first target:
Wyll,"Don't throw your life away, Karlach. Not like this."
Wyll,"If we're meant to die, then let's do it together. Doing something worth dying for - hunting devils."
Wyll,"I'm worried for every desperate soul Mizora will recruit to the Blood War, every life she snuffs out on Zariel's whims."
Wyll,So be it. They'd lose nothing but power they hadn't yet gained. I'm not worried for them.
Wyll,"Then we die proud, knowing we braved the Hells to slay the fiend who held my leash."
Wyll,"I can't force you, Karlach. And if you'd rather go now - here - I suppose I have no choice but to respect it, though it breaks my heart in two."
Wyll,"So be it. The next we meet, my blade will stained with Mizora's blood."
Wyll,Come. The next page in our saga begins.
Wyll,But you? You've earned the right to be called 'hero' a thousand times over. What a gift you've been to the Sword Coast.
Wyll,"All these years as the Blade - I've been called a champion. A hero. A legend. Names I never asked for, praise I never sought."
Wyll,I hoped you'd say 'yes'.
Wyll,"I'm sorry. The next we meet, my blade will stained with Mizora's blood."
Wyll,"Wherever you go, you take my heart with you. So strong is my love that not even a devil could break it."
Wyll,"Perhaps one day you'll change your mind - but if you won't, at least know this:"
Wyll,I - I don't know what to say. I was sure we'd be carving out a future together.
Wyll,Forget Mizora. The people of the Coast call to the Blade and his star. Are you ready to be their hero?
Wyll,But I can't. Not when I know deep down that you're right.
Wyll,"*Sigh.* I must have played this conversation in my head a dozen times this tenday, and practised how I'd say 'no'."
Wyll,Courage. Insight. Strategy. Justice. The four pillars of power. Not an eldritch blast to be found.
Wyll,I'm the Blade of Avernus. I swore to cleanse the Hells of the devils that threaten the Coast.
Wyll,I am the Blade of Frontiers. I swore to protect the Coast from the monsters that prey on it.
Wyll,"I want you to join me. Warriors, lovers, guardians. Two champions as one."
Wyll,A reasonable person would say 'no'. I still want you to say 'yes'.
Wyll,Of course we can. And I know just how to do it.
Wyll,It is. But that doesn't mean I have to discard you like a rotted carcass.
Wyll,An uneasy life awaits you. But know this:
Wyll,"I was selfish to ask you to live a half-life as an underground plaything for a duke. And even more selfish, to be disappointed by your answer."
Wyll,But it warms me to know you'll be near.
Wyll,"It pains me to know you must live this half-life, hidden in shadows when you deserve to bask in the Sword Coast's sun."
Wyll,What a gift you've been to me. What an honour to know a true legend.
Wyll,"Gods, you're so wonderful, my heart's near to bursting."
Wyll,This doesn't have to be the end.
Wyll,"We'll make a place for you in the undercity, a secluded corner of your own. I'll bring you anything you need - robes, books... sustenance. You'll be safe."
Wyll,"You know me, you understand me. And for that, I'm forever grateful."
Wyll,I would never.
Wyll,I love you. But I can't be with you. Not the way I wanted.
Wyll,They would never see you as the hero I know you to be. They would only see a mind flayer.
Wyll,The people of Baldur's Gate will accept a devil as a duke - but they'd never accept his mind flayer consort.
Wyll,A beautiful fantasy. If only I could wish it into being.
Wyll,"I'd parade you through the streets if I could. 'The illithid who saved Baldur's Gate', the bards would cry - and you would take your rightful place at the side of Grand Duke Wyll Ravengard."
Wyll,"Anything for you, my love. Together, we'll cut the Hells in two. And Zariel will never lay a hand on you - I swear it."
Wyll,"That is... how are you feeling, darling? You look... peaked."
Wyll,The eternal burden of my pact. I certainly couldn't expect you to shoulder it too.
Wyll,"Come, rest with me tonight. And next I see you, may that flame be raging even stronger."
Wyll,"Heh - I was selfish to ask. And even more selfish, to be disappointed by your answer."
Wyll,I meant it. And I still do.
Wyll,"This was good fun! You know me fairly well, it turns out."
Wyll,"Together we've shed blood, shared words. Yet you've learned so little."
Wyll,"Never. That you live, that you walk this path, is a delight worth celebrating, not lamenting."
Wyll,"There you are! A bit less corporeal than I imagined, but looking splendid all the same!"
Wyll,"There you are, Lae'zel! A bit less corporeal than I imagined, but looking splendid all the same!"
Wyll,"Gods, you always could bring a smile to my face."
Wyll,There you are. I was hoping you'd make your way over.
Wyll,Thanks be to Withers. Even a duke deserves a night off.
Wyll,"Ah - cool, fresh air. By the living gods, I needed it."
Wyll,"Good song, good company. And good wine, from the looks of it."
Wyll,The whole gang is here. Wish I'd had time to polish up the horns.
Wyll,"Beautiful fete, grander than any of the patriars' dreary banquets."
Wyll,A beautiful night. I wish it could last forever.
Wyll,"Good song, good company, good wine. I wish it could last forever."
Wyll,I don't know how to explain it. Maybe I don't need to.
Wyll,Seems like a century ago that we were all together - but also like no time's passed at all.
Wyll,"All my favourite people in one place. Not to mention, all my favourite wines."
Wyll,"A night without care - no worry, no obligation. It's been too long."
Wyll,"New days, old friends. There's no greater joy."
Wyll,Cool breeze blowing through.
Wyll,"Is it me, or has it gotten a bit nippy?"
Wyll,Only a few head colds - and a tongue-lashing from my worried father.
Wyll,I'll be - my old fishing spot. Spent more than a few Summertide days here.
Wyll,"Not closed to Duke Ulder Ravengard's own son, surely?"
Wyll,"My kill count's much lower, I fear - though I slip away for a hunt when I can. I may no longer be the Blade, but my heart is never far from the frontiers."
Wyll,"That said, rebuilding a city requires less a sharp blade and more a politic mind."
Wyll,"Bargains must be made, coin must change hands, tongues must be held in check."
Wyll,Father leaves me to my own devices - though he's got no shortage of advice when I ask for it.
Wyll,"My father, Ulder Ravengard, is now Grand Duke of the Triad, Keeper of the Fist."
Wyll,But the city's lords and ladies were all too eager to abandon their oaths and bend the knee.
Wyll,I don't expect a soldier or street-sweeper to see through the schemes of a tyrant like Gortash.
Wyll,"Disbanded, to be formed anew."
Wyll,"Still, there's no friction that can't be greased with a sly promise or a proposition."
Wyll,"The patriars, the aristocracy, the councils of Waterdeep and Amn? Their arms aren't so wide open."
Wyll,The people know me as one of the champions who saved their beloved city. They know Ravengard blood flows through my veins.
Wyll,Which isn't to say I've gone without opposition.
Wyll,"I like to think I've had a healing touch. Baldur's Gate rises again, brick by brick, stone by stone."
Wyll,Am I hearing this right? Has the great wizard Gale been keeping tabs on the Gate? Consider me flattered.
Wyll,It's the least we could do. Your faith in this city should inspire us all.
Wyll,"Ah, so the God of Ambition has had his eye on me. I'm flattered, old chum."
Wyll,"For the good, I like to think. Brick by brick, stone by stone, it's started to heal. Though I've met my fair share of challenges."
Wyll,"I've had more than a few challenges, given the horns sprouting from my head."
Wyll,"Father's very well, and back in his element - commanding the Flaming Fist with as brave a heart as ever, and with nary a scolding or lashing."
Wyll,"Florrick, bless her soul, convinced him to withhold the lashings and scoldings, though I know he was tempted."
Wyll,"Father's very well, and back in his element - commanding the Flaming Fist with as brave a heart as ever."
Wyll,"Now he's back in his element - commanding the Flaming Fist with as brave a heart as ever, and with nary a scolding or lashing."
Wyll,"I told him the truth of things. Of the pact, of the tadpoles - all of it. And for the first time in seven years, I felt his embrace."
Wyll,"He appeared at the family home the day after the Absolute fell. Confused, dishevelled - but unharmed."
Wyll,- not a devil of the First Hell.
Wyll,"Still, I make the decisions I see fit, the ones I think will restore the city to glory. I serve only  Baldur's Gate -"
Wyll,"I've felt your gaze. Whenever a chill passes through me, I know Shar's favoured is close."
Wyll,Say you'll come.
Wyll,"Father is safe, Florrick. He is freed from the grip of the Absolute."
Wyll,Father's words.
Wyll,Karlach? What's wrong?
Wyll,I think she needs a moment to herself.
Wyll,"Killed by her own kid? A damn tragedy, that."
Wyll,"The voice doesn't know we didn't conquer its trials. But after that last battle, I declare us conquerors nonetheless."
Wyll,The great dragon lies beyond. He must be freed.
Wyll,"It's all right, I promise. But I hope when the sun sets and the stars rise, your dreams always lead to me."
Wyll,"I value affection over fun, a lasting memory over a passing fancy. This is our story, not theirs."
Wyll,"No, no. I want romance, not - not debauchery."
Wyll,"I thought we were weaving our own tale, you and me. Don't turn your back on it.<br>"
Wyll,No. Just no.
Wyll,I don't think so. But I appreciate the offer.
Wyll,A necessary step for my city's future. The Hells' fires ran red hot that day; I don't remember it fondly.
Wyll,"You'd have been right, not so long ago. But things have changed - a different time, a different Blade."
Wyll,A mug of nutty darndarr and a plate of cured meats? It's no Mount Celestia - but it's close.
Wyll,Yes - a hero in all senses. A courageous explorer and a just spirit. Would that we all aspired to his greatness.
Wyll,Yes - a hero in all senses. A courageous explorer and a just spirit. A pity to see what's become of him.
Wyll,"It pains me to hear you say it. We shared a bond, or so I thought. Does it mean nothing to you?"
Wyll,"He gave me no choice. But it's true. I often wonder - what if I'd said the right words, made the right promises?"
Wyll,"Truly spoken. All he'd done for Baldur's Gate, for its people... He earned a better fate than the one Gortash gave him."
Wyll,The Hells threatened to swallow the city. I made the only choice I could.
Wyll,"No - we acted justly. That Karlach still lives is a delight worth celebrating, not lamenting."
Wyll,The solution's plain as the High Moors in Midsummer. Let's chat.
Wyll,Father...
Wyll,My father. He's here.
Wyll,And... my father?
Wyll,The Hells with that. Nothing is over. Not while I still draw breath.
Wyll,My good lady. I am Wyll Ravengard. My business is the city's business.
Wyll,My good lady. I am Wyll Ravengard. I will not pay to enter my own city.
Wyll,Gods. Stelmane is... dead?
Wyll,"Gods. Stelmane is really gone, then."
Wyll,A thief walks free. Is this truly justice?
Wyll,A harsh sentence for all but the most heinous crimes.
Wyll,Ask and receive. My lips are sealed.
Wyll,"Both. Relevant words for times of strife - and for a dragon's underground trial, if we're lucky."
Wyll,"Wise indeed, though I can't take credit. It was my father who taught me the ways of the just."
Wyll,"Let's say I succeed, free his mind. Then what?"
Wyll,"If such violence is truly justice, then let it never again be called a virtue."
Wyll,"Justice. No pardon without repentance, and no penalty without mercy."
Wyll,"Come now, have a heart. She's only a child.<br>"
Wyll,"Goodbye, father. May your soul be at rest."
Wyll,"Father, I'm... sorry. But this fight's not over. Baldur's Gate won't fall, not while I still draw breath."
Wyll,"Father, please. Come back to me."
Wyll,No - this isn't him. This is the tadpole talking.
Wyll,Punished? Gods - what has he done?
Wyll,An impostor? But who in the Hells...
Wyll,"Please, stay your hand. My father's life is at stake."
Wyll,"Keep calm, I beg you. If we do battle, my father will perish at our own hands."
Wyll,The right path often lies between the extremes.
Wyll,"I want you to see my blade slice her wings off her back, to hear her groans as she dissolves into ash."
Wyll,"It's not about me. It's about every desperate soul Mizora will recruit to the Blood War, every life she snuffs out on Zariel's whims."
Wyll,I knew you'd say 'yes'.
Wyll,"Bloated as a pufferfish. He takes a few drinks, and I bet he'll pop."
Wyll,Is that... the kid Kagha went after? Seems she's learned a new trick.
Wyll,"Damn it - new powers or not, the kid's going to get herself killed."
Wyll,Sending a child out there to die? Damned spiteful - even for you.
Wyll,Sending a child out there to die? Damned spiteful. Figured you better than that.
Wyll,"The tiefling's seen better days. Arabella's father, I wager."
Wyll,Hells. Arabella's father's met a most unpleasant end.
Wyll,Bad luck. Let's call this... a learning moment.
Wyll,What is it they say? Ah yes - 'Curiosity killed the kobold.' <br>
Wyll,"My, my - is it me, or do I see a bit of flush in those cheeks?"
Wyll,"Go on, tell the bastard. All the better for us if he keeps Raphael - busy."
Wyll,"So this was the wardevil who slaughtered Shar's faithful. At Raphael's urging, no less."
Wyll,"Balduran's bones, what a performance - you'd put the Five Flagons to shame!"
Wyll,"Is it just me, or are the rats here surprisingly... eloquent?"
Wyll,That rodent's got the spirit of a centaur. I've got to respect it.
Wyll,Curious little thing. I respect its pluck.
Wyll,The blighter's worked up. Wonder what's got under its skin?
Wyll,"Not as if you can relate to the killing urge, can you? Hmph - I can taste the hypocrisy from here."
Wyll,Poor thing - a life of torture! We should let her go. Shouldn't we?
Wyll,He's gone - and we need to follow. He'll feel the safest where the shadows are deepest.
Wyll,"Hear that? The light might fend them off, but those mastiffs are still lurking about."
Wyll,The curse has wrecked this man. This is no life - this is torture.
Wyll,"I'd say you broke the poor fellow, but I wager he came that way."
Wyll,Ugh - I know that corpse. Arabella's father's met a most unpleasant end.
Wyll,Ugh - I know that corpse. Arabella's mother's met a most unpleasant end.
Wyll,"Was it? A thousand apologies. You are a legend, and no accusation or aspersion can diminish you."
Wyll,"I must confess, there's a certain dignity to it. The grand champion wearing an unholy skin."
Wyll,You gave up so much so that others could walk free. I know sacrifice - and I must honour yours.
Wyll,No question. The people will sing psalms praising your name - and my voice will be the loudest among them.
Wyll,You gave up so much so that others could walk free. I know sacrifice - and I must honour yours.<br>
Wyll,"No offence meant, of course. I can never forget what you did for us, for the city."
Wyll,"Before we met, some hailed me as a saviour, some as a legend. But now, I've seen the face of true heroism: yours.<br>"
Wyll,"The last death of the day, I hope. Your duty is fulfilled. "
Wyll,Never have I known a prince more noble. I hope he can find peace.
Wyll,A brave and noble prince. May the stories of his sacrifice travel far and wide.
Wyll,A grim sight indeed. My lungs already grow heavy with shadow.
Wyll,"Good-bye Lae'zel, fiercest of warriors. My heart remains yours, always."
Wyll,Let's make camp. My muscles are stiffer than a stuffed cat.
Wyll,Well chosen. An accursed advantage - but an advantage all the same.
Wyll,"By Balduran's helm, only a fiend or fool would bargain with this damnable creature."
Wyll,Florrick's here? Where can I find her?
Wyll,Come on. We need to talk to Florrick.
Wyll,"The Absolute's taken him, then - no question about it."
Wyll,That's a whole lot of soldiers - a dead end in every sense of the term.
Wyll,Hells. Only a monster would inflict misery and call it medicine.
Wyll,"That tiefling's seen better days. Arabella's mother, I wager."
Wyll,"That tiefling's seen better days. Arabella's father, I wager."
Wyll,"The Prince of the Comet has fallen. He sacrificed everything to stop the Grand Design. Does that mean nothing to you, Lae'zel?<br>"
Wyll,"No offence meant, of course. I can never forget your sacrifice for us, for the city."
Wyll,I'm with the Harper. We should take every advantage in reach.
Wyll,"Come on, chief - get a hold of yourself!"
Wyll,And Lathander's priests? Did the githyanki just - kill them and take over?
Wyll,You sure about that? Not every glowing light is an invitation to take what's inside it.
Wyll,"Hells - I don't like the look of that. Run, damn it, run!"
Wyll,Leave it be. Not every glowing light is an invitation take what's inside it.
Wyll,You heard the warnings. Are you sure you want to stick your hand where it wasn't invited?
Wyll,Damn - you showed that egg who's boss. A real hero.
Wyll,Are you mad? That artefact's the only thing shielding us from the Absolute's voice.
Wyll,Extraordinary - like a waking dream. Where have we gotten to?
Wyll,"Incredible. It feels like nowhere and everywhere, all at once."
Wyll,Go on. I'll keep watch here.
Wyll,"Stick close. One sight of us, and they'll lash out."
Wyll,Nere'll die if we leave. Is that a chance you want to take?
Wyll,The Moonlantern's broken? Just our luck.
Wyll,What's wrong - is the plant getting to you? You look sicker than a drunk derro.
Wyll,"An owlbear's pissed in your porridge, from the sounds of it. Just remember: I'm not your enemy here."
Wyll,"That 'nothing' sure looks like something to me. If you need to rest, just say the word."
Wyll,"From this angle, there's nothing you can't endure."
Wyll,"Mind flayers buried tadpoles in our brains, and then we crashed to the ground on the banks of the Chionthar.<br>"
Wyll,We'll work it out. We always do.
Wyll,"No worse than having mind flayers bury a tadpole your brain, or crashing to the ground on the banks of the Chionthar."
Wyll,"In that case, I've got just one thing to say - 'Meow'."
Wyll,It's only a horrific machine of unspeakable form. What's the worst that could happen?
Wyll,"Enough, already - we need to stop this thing!"
Wyll,Hells - I've got a bad feeling about this.
Wyll,Well now - seems I'm in the presence of a gith legend in the making!
Wyll,"I appreciate a wandering hand now and again, but maybe control your urges for now."
Wyll,I can feel it... looking. Deep inside...
Wyll,Keep calm. Even the Blade of Frontiers knows when he's outmatched.
Wyll,"Ketheric plays a cruel game, and you had no choice but to play. Now let's talk to Z'rell."
Wyll,Ghastly thing - yet loyal to the Absolute.
Wyll,"Holy hells. Each one, a mind flayer in waiting."
Wyll,No. Annihilation is the only option.
Wyll,"They came from below. We could destroy them, or perhaps..."
Wyll,Z'rell - fancy name. Let's put our best foot forward. Or is it best feet?
Wyll,The gaping abyss. You don't intend to jump - or do you?
Wyll,"A Moonlantern, I wager. There's no overstating the advantage we'll gain with that light."
Wyll,"Gortash, as in Enver Gortash? Last I knew, he was a minor player in city affairs."
Wyll,Florrick.
Wyll,Play along with the Fist. We can deal with him later.
Wyll,Thaniel? I know the name. Halsin spoke of him - something about the 'spirit of the land'.
Wyll,The Triad help us...
Wyll,"Shit, no - father!"
Wyll,"Please, we should search. My soul hangs in the balance."
Wyll,"Mizora's still in that pod. If we open this door, the Hells will swallow me on the spot."
Wyll,"Please, we should search this illithid colony further. My soul hangs in the balance."
Wyll,"We haven't freed Zariel's infernal asset - the one Mizora sent us to find. If we enter now, I'm good as dead."
Wyll,"By the good gods, such cruelty. Is your soul truly this sick?"
Wyll,The Hells have had their vengeance - and I doubt they are done with me.
Wyll,Then I'll have your back. Isn't that what friends do?
Wyll,An ambitious enterprise. One I doubt Mystra will stand for.
Wyll,Gale - what about you? Where do you go from here?
Wyll,"I'd like that. So would father, I bet. A nipper to bear his name, learn the pillars. Courage, insight, strategy, justice."
Wyll,"Ha! You've already thought about a little Ravengard running around, have you?"
Wyll,How could I ever refuse you?
Wyll,"And a magnificent ball, I presume, for dancing the night away. You wear your finest, and I'll look for one of father's dress uniforms."
Wyll,"And a magnificent ball, I presume, for dancing the night away. You dressed to the nines, me in the finest uniform I can convince father to lend me."
Wyll,"After that, well - it's up to us to decide. Any ideas?"
Wyll,"*Sigh* If only last night could have lasted forever. But if I'm to be a Grand Duke, I've got to greet the people and gain their trust."
Wyll,"Then you reignited my fires. When I'm at your side, I want for nothing."
Wyll,"When Mizora drained my warlock powers, it was if a blizzard froze me through."
Wyll,- and in more ways than one.
Wyll,I am a new man -
Wyll,"But last night, I swear to you - your touch healed every one of my bruises and wiped away every scar."
Wyll,"My shining star. Since I've known you, we've shed more blood than could ever fill the Chionthar. The wounds we sustained were the testament to our might."
Wyll,She really is the truest embodiment of her people's spirit.<br>
Wyll,"I can't force her. But I don't want to watch, either. I can't."
Wyll,Thank the gods you've seen sense. Come! To Avernus we go - our next adventure awaits.
Wyll,"So? What do you say? Die here, now, or live on with people who love you. Zariel won't touch you. I swear it, Karlach."
Wyll,No. Stop. My love - We can save her. We can take her to Avernus.
Wyll,"So? What do you say? Die here, now, or live on with the Blade of Avernus at your side? Zariel won't touch you. I swear it, Karlach."
Wyll,"No. Stop. I won't allow this. Karlach, you're coming with me - back to Avernus."
Wyll,"We can't let her die - not like this, not now."
Wyll,"I'd like that. Someone to carry our name, learn the four pillars. If only father -"
Wyll,Well. Father would have loved having a grandchild. I know we'll raise a family worthy of his name.
Wyll,"My star. The parasites have barely withered, your heart still hurts for them."
Wyll,"Let it be done. The Jewel of the Coast will shine ever bright, welcoming the weak and the weary, from wherever they hail."
Wyll,I want you to join me. A reasonable person would say 'no'. I still want you to say 'yes'.
Wyll,I'm the Blade of Avernus. I swore to cleanse the Hells of the devils that threaten the Coast. And I know my first target:
Wyll,"There's something I need to ask you. Something terrible, something greedy, something unreasonable."
Wyll,"Through you, I've been born anew."
Wyll,- and I've got you to thank for it.
Wyll,I see it in your eyes. The time is near.
Wyll,"What future, Karlach? A future without you in it is no future at all. Is there really no other way? <br>"
Wyll,"You won't be alone. I need to set Baldur's Gate to rights after this disaster, but once she's stable, I could join you. Hunt out devils - real devils - together."
Wyll,"Oh, my love. I wish I could understand. But I respect your wishes. If this is your time, I will stand by your side."
Wyll,"Then this is goodbye. For now. Until we meet again, my love - I'll think of you every day. Now go. Live. You deserve that much."
Wyll,"Karlach, by the gods. I don't want to lose you..."
Wyll,But I can't abandon you either. Return to Avernus - for now - and I'll join you once the city's been put to rights after this disaster.
Wyll,Raphael's set his sights on Zariel's throne. She'll be too busy fighting him to pursue you.
Wyll,"*Sigh* If only last night could have lasted forever. How are you feeling, my darling?"
Wyll,A duke I'm soon to be - but the Blade's heart is never far from the frontiers.
Wyll,It's the least we can give them: a future worth looking forward to.
Wyll,- hope for leaders that won't turn their backs to suffering.
Wyll,"I'm not Gortash. I don't want to instil fear, I want to instil hope. Hope for a bountiful future, hope for a life free of tyranny and torment -"
Wyll,"And why not name myself Archduke while I'm at it, maybe build some steel automatons to watch over the gates?"
Wyll,I hope we never have to turn to the final page.
Wyll,"What a joy, this life we're about to make, this story we're about to write - every chapter more thrilling than the last."
Wyll,If father were here... he'd be so proud of you. Proud of us.
Wyll,"I can't. I'm responsible for Baldur's Gate. She needs me - desperately, now more than ever. I can't abandon her."
Wyll,I'm sure it will come to pass. Find me when it's done - I'll want to hear your story.
Wyll,The Age of the Absolute has begun!
Wyll,That face. The one from my dreams...<br>
Wyll,"When the Netherbrain died, the tadpoles died with it. I'll never be some grotesque illithid!"
Wyll,"My mind is clear, its burden lifted. When the Netherbrain died, the tadpoles died with it."
Wyll,"Gale... he did it, he really did it. The Netherbrain is defeated."
Wyll,"I can't feel the tadpole. By the Triad, we're cleansed - we will never be mind flayers!"
Wyll,"I can't feel the tadpole. By the Triad, I am cleansed - I will never be a mind flayer!"
Wyll,But Gale... I can't believe he's gone. 
Wyll,"The city must remember him. Not just for his triumph, but for his courage. "
Wyll,Hold on - where's Karlach?
Wyll,"She's at camp, waiting for us. I - I don't think she'll be able to hang on much longer."
Wyll,"Camp, would be my guess. She - she doesn't have much time left."
Wyll,What are you doing?! No!
Wyll,"Shit. Astarion, you need to get out of the light."
Wyll,"You already made the greatest sacrifice for us. I cannot believe you are ready to make another, but I thank you for it. "
Wyll,Gale? Is something the matter?
Wyll,What's our leader have to say?
Wyll,"A nip, a dance, and a song? Don't mind if I do - I think we're due an evening's reprieve."
Wyll,"For now, though - let us leave Gale to his future, and turn to our own."
Wyll,"After all, Mystra's not about to welcome him to the pantheon with open arms."
Wyll,"Once Gale tasted of godhood, he was always bound to fill himself full. May he be wiser than he is cocksure, for his own sake."
Wyll,"So - what now? I don't know about you, but I could use a flagon or three of ale."
Wyll,"A suggestion, if I may: a celebration. I know I could use a few sips of good ale."
Wyll,"The city will cheer us - but it is the triumph itself, the very smiting of evil, that should lift our hearts."
Wyll,"My powers... they're draining. Just like Mizora said they would. A small price to pay, in the grand scheme of things. "
Wyll,"Take a moment, savour our victory. Long may the coastwinds carry our names."
Wyll,"What? Lae'zel, no!"
Wyll,"There lies our answer. Use the Netherstones on the Crown, and we can bring an end to this."
Wyll,Damned stubborn fool. We can stop this thing. You don't have to -
Wyll,"Perish the thought. I have no intention of failing, and neither should you."
Wyll,Something's wrong. Talk to me.
Wyll,Shut it out. Let it die.
Wyll,"Is this our final parting then? Please, reconsider. Alone, you are a storm. But together, we are a tempest."
Wyll,"Baldur's Gate burns, and its people tremble. I can't yet turn my back - not while the city's wounds still bleed."
Wyll,Yes. Baldur's Gate will rise ever stronger. Let us be the ones to lay the first bricks.
Wyll,"I can't believe I'm about to say this, but - part of me will miss you."
Wyll,They carved our course. Honour them with each and every step you take. 
Wyll,Shit. That can't be good.
Wyll,"Lest we forget - there are still graves to dig, injured to thank, warriors to exalt."
Wyll,"Astarion will keep to the dark now, I wager. At least... he'll find plenty to feast on."
Wyll,Excellent. Let's see if the Elfsong's still standing. Their Golden Sands Brew goes down real easy.<br>
Wyll,"Answer it, then - but you'll be going without me. I'm sorry."
Wyll,"It's unfair. All you've done for me, for the Sword Coast - only to be forced into the dark. I'll miss you dearly."
Wyll,Then we'll both be carving our own paths. I wish you well in yours.
Wyll,"I can't guarantee you a warm welcome in the city, but should you find me, you'll have a seat at my table."
Wyll,It seems you've found peace with yourself - I'm glad. Just as long as your intentions remain as pure as they are now. 
Wyll,"We honour Gale. A plaque perhaps, or better yet a statue. "
Wyll,"Speaking of githyanki, what will you do now, Lae'zel? Will you join them? "
Wyll,"The githyanki are leaving us. An unlikely place to find ourselves, fighting on the same side as them."
Wyll,Hells - Astarion. The sun's already begun to scorch you.
Wyll,A stroke of fortune.
